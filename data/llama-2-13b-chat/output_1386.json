        "Summarize the following story in first person: I had everything planned out. I was going to come home and surprise my mom. It had been a few weeks since I had seen my mom since I went to go live on my Aunts farm for the summer. But I knew her birthday was in the middle of summer. I had told my Aunt how I wanted to go home and surprised my mom with a cake and presents and all of her friends and family around. So about four months ago my Aunt, my Uncle and my little cousin all flew back to surprise my  mom. I had also called all of her friends and other family to come visit. Once home we all hid while my mom and dad were out shopping. ( My dad was in on the whole time) So whenever she got home we all yelled SURPRISE! whenever she walked in. The best part about the whole day was how shocked and happy she was. I still remember it like it was yesterday. I truly believe it was my moms favorite birthday ever. All she wanted was to have her whole family around. I made sure to give her exactly what she wanted. I ended up not going back to my aunts house for the rest of summer and I stayed home with my parents. I love my family and they mean so much to me! I was happy to be able to give my mom such a good birthday."
