        "Summarize the following story in first person: a few months back a really good friend of my brother and i passed of a drug overdose. it was one of the hardest times in my life. we had known brian for years, since we were both in high school. he was a great guy, dealt a crappy life and a lot to fight through. we had just helped him through rehab after his family had given up and wouldn't support him, even to get into a rehab. he got out, reunited with his family, and i got him a job at the print shop i work at. it wasn't the greatest place, but it was a decent solid living for him and i. he was only there about a month. when the paychecks started really kicking in, he must have gone out and picked up one night. he never made it to work the day after payday. we had to call to see if he was coming in, and his aunt who he was staying with told us what happened. we all made it through so much together, and honestly he might have been the best among, it just shouldn't have been him. It was terrible, and a week later I went to his funeral. We said goodbye to him. We keep in touch with his family, they are like family now. His sisters really took it hard, and from time to time we all get together to have lunch and remember brian."
