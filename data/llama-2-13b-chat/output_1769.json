        "Summarize the following story in first person: Today was an amazing day. It was a company party and I was talking to one of the other teachers in my department. We were discussing a bunch of little things. We grabbed a couple drinks and food from the open bar and buffet. As we drank and ate a few other coworkers came over to us and started talking to us. A few of them were pretty drunk but a few of them were fine just asking a bunch of questions to us. I started talking to this one really cute girl. We start talking about our lives and we were super similar. She was such a lovely person but I became super nervous to talk to her. So I grabbed a couple drinks as we were talking it helped my nerves. We keep talking it was going great. Then she asked where we were going next. My friend said I dont know so we started just following the girls lead and left with them Then the girls starting walking away from us. I realized they were kinda drunk but wanted us to come to the next bar. At that bar I randomly ran into a few of other coworkers. But I kept talking to this one girl. It was going great but I started to get a bit drunk. So we went to another bar because that was totally a good idea. It was not I kept getting more drunk but I kept having a good time with this girl. We ended up going home together. I truly thought it was never to going to work out long term but it did. Over 5 months later everything is going amazing. She is really becoming the love of my life"
