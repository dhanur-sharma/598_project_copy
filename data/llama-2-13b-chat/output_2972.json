        "Summarize the following story in first person: Three months ago my Mom became sick enough to go to the ER. The result was a five day hospital stay and then a nineteen day stay at a step down facility. I stayed with her during this entire time. I only left to get something to eat or purchase items that she wanted. Nobody was allowed to visit from home because she was contagious. So it was just her and I for the duration. It was during this time that I had a personal awakening. The week before all of this happened I had been to the doctor myself for my first visit in over two years. Some health issues were discovered that I had not been paying attention to. My sister died two years ago after a short hard fight against a very aggressive cancer. After this I just didn't care about taking care of myself anymore. So while I was with Mom it finally clicked what I needed to do for me. So during this time I began to exercise everyday. By the end of her stay I felt better, had so much more energy and felt better mentally. I have been trying to continue this since she came home. Now I feel like I am winning again."
