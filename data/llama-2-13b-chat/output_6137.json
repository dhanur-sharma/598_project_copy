        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last week my family came into some money. My brother started a business and it was going really well. I don't make much money so he decided i was no longer worth his time. I helped get his business started by helping put stuff together for the store. But now that he is doing well i guess he feels he is too good for me. It hurt me so much. I couldn't believe he would treat me this way. my entire life has been difficult. I am unable to work normal jobs due to physical limitations from a back injury. When i was a child i was shoved down some stairs and harmed my back badly needing surgery. Due to this i am limited to the things i can do. Because of this i do not make much money and i probably never will. I had already felt bad enough about this. I am always self conscious about my financial state. I barely make it from one paycheck to the next.  However, my brother was always there for me. Which is why it was hard to handle that suddenly because he makes more money than me that he would treat me like i don't matter, knowing how much i suffer solely from the state of my finances. It's just too much to bear."
