        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last month, we went to Sesame Place. It was the first time my boys got to meet their favorite Sesame characters! I will never forget the looks on their faces when they saw Elmo. It was like they saw a celebrity! He was part of the parade and walked right over to us. At first my son, Theo, was a little shy. I don't think he expected the characters to be so big! He was a bit hesitant and slowly put out his hand for a handshake. But then, once Elmo grabbed his hand, Theo went in for a big hug! We got great photos. It was the best! They also got to meet other characters like Cookie Monster, Grover, and Big Bird. They enjoyed going on a few kiddie rides too. We also spent some time in the water park. Their joy and excitement is something that will always stay with me. I'm so glad we got to share this experience!"
