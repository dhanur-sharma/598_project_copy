        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last week, I took my five year old shopping for his supplies for Kindergarten.  It's really hard for me to believe he is actually about to start Kindergarten.  I feel like we have so much to get ready and prepare and there are only a few weeks left to do it.  I still need to get him a backpack and some back to school clothes.  What shocks me the most is that my little baby boy is actually going to be starting school.  I still think of him as a little two year old running around in diapers and babbling words.  It's just unfathomable to me that he is going to have books and walk away from me and enter a building all on his own.  I almost feel frozen like I Don't want to prepare things because I want to deny that this is happening.  Nonetheless, I know it is happening and I need to get him ready.  He is excited and wanting to get new shoes.  He wants these light up ones that have PJ Masks on them because he loves that show, so I am going to get him those.  He also needs some new outfits because he has grown so much this summer.  It's also crazy to me that my little baby boy can now reach the top of the counter.  He can do so much stuff that he didn't used to be able to do.  I'm mainly just struggling with not having him here with me during the day.  I will have my other children home with  me but what about him?  I kinda want to just freeze time and pretend none of this is happening, but he is so excited to go get his new shoes that I have to carry on and put on a happy face."
