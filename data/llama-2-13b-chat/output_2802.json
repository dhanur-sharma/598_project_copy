        "Summarize the following story in first person: My memorable moments was my when i saw my uncle after 15 years. From India, he came to USA to visit me (especially) and my family. My uncle has taken care of me like a daughter, when i was a child. He, among all the other members of my family has taken care of me,  but i got  a special love & care from him, when my parents where leaving in a different state, due to business commitment. When my uncle and aunt came to USA, i was happy and emotional at the same time. The reason why i was emotional & sad because my uncle was diagnose with lung cancer and according to his report he won't survive very long because both his lungs were damaged. He came for treatment in USA but even here, their was no hope for him. To make most of his trip worth it, I tried to take my uncle to places, like Statue of Liberty, Empire State building even went to Florida together, with family. We laughed, talked and enjoyed time together.  The time went smoothly, without even considering that he was a sick men. He left USA without any treatment.  He told me one thing before leaving from USA which i will remember forever, that \" Life is unpredictable when and where it will end their is no guarantee, so cherish each and every moment with a smile on face and love in your heart\" I cried when he said that because i knew i will never see him again.  That was the last time i saw him and we bid adieu to each other. He went back to India but his treatment didn't last for long. The doctors and his family tried best to support him and pay as much attention as possible, but when you have no chance of surviving you just feel worthless and hopeless. He felt the same! I talked to him over the phone and he was very down; i felt sad and depressed.  That was the last i heard his voice, after few days he died."
