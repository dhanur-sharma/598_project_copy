        "Summarize the following story in first person: I will always remember where I was when I got the phone call.  It was 2nd period math class and my 4th graders were rowdy as usual.  I could tell their attention was slipping and I was having trouble getting them to pay attention. I was feeling a little miserable and sorry for myself.  One of the administrators poked her head into my classroom and I remember thinking one of the kids was having a family emergency.  I stepped out into the hallway.  My friend's wife Susan was sobbing on the phone as she told me my friend had passed.  I felt all the air go out out of my lungs.  My stomach dropped.  I was in shock.  I  walked back into my classroom, numb.  I started packing my things to go.  The administrator had gone to get a substitute teacher.  The kids could all see that something had happened and settled down.  One of the girls asked if I was OK.  I said \"my friend died\" without even really meaning to.  The kids got me tissues and tried to distract me as we waited for the sub."
