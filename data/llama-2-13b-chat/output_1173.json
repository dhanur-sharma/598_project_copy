        "Summarize the following story in first person: My brother was married recently. It was a monumental task getting him to the alter. Not because he weighs 400 pounds, but because he lives in a balloon above the lakehouse. He is also lactose intolerant. Once we found a contemporary moo-moo to suit the occasion we settled on a caterer who worked with all vegan cheese and could even make a poutine. Well my brother is also a cheapskate and \"forgot\" to pay the caterer. Right before the ceremony began there was a knock at the door and some lovely hors d'oeuvres were delivered on a large platter. My brother took one look at the vegan cheese balls and dug in. Smugly he reminded me that this is why you never pay for things. Later, while waiting for the ceremony to begin I noticed my brother shifting uneasily. \"I think there was something wrong with those cheese balls\", he says. I had my suspicions about the lactose content of the vegan cheese balls but remained stoic. As the bells chimed and the union was formally announced for the first time the bride and groom were to walk down the aisle and out into the open air. Only my brother never made it that far. He started to walk at an almost frantic pace, practically dragging his new bride in his efforts to get out of the church. It was all for nothing though, as he tripped on the roll of red carpet he had wanted rolled out and collapsed in agony as he let out of massive fart. People were aghast, speechless, dismayed. One lady sprinted for the door. All in all it was a good wedding."
