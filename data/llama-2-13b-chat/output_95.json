        "Summarize the following story in first person: About two months ago I finally got some great news in the mail.  Often my mail is consumed with junk and most of it gets tossed into the recycling, but on this particualr day, there was a golden letter that I couldn't have been happier about receiving.  It was a letter informing me that the school was re-opening its doors.  This meant I my days of homeschooling were coming to an end!  A year earlier, I had learned that the school my children were going to was closing.  Major repairs needed to be done on the school and I had to find an alternative for my children.  I looked and looked for good alternatives, but there were none.  I live in a small town and the closest school was miles away.  It just wasn't feasable to drive my kids to school when it would take us an hour to get there and an hour to get back.  Hence, my journing into the world of homeschooling began.  I didn't want to homeschool because I knew it would be difficult.  My children were used to the routine of public school and not their mom being their teacher.  How was I supposed to keep them engaged and interested in learning when they are at home?  The distractions in the house were too great with all their electronic devices.  I decided that I had to become two different people, mom and teacher.  I also had to designate an area of the house as the school zone.  Despite this, my children had a hard time adjusting to me being their teacher.  They would wine about the homework and compare me to what it was like when they were attending public school.  I had to remind them over and over why we were doing things they way we were.  I think it took us a good couple of months to really get into the flow of homeschooling.  It wore me out to homeschool.  I did enjoy having my children home, but it was exhasting mentally and physically.  I was used to some quiet time during the day, but now my day was full of teaching my own children.  So on that blessed day close to two months ago when I recieved that letter informing me that the school was going to re-open, I jumped for joy.  It isn't that I didn't like being with my children everyday and teaching them, it was difficult."
