        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was working a dead end job. Sure it was in line with what i loved doing, but it was in the worst company i have ever worked for to date.  It was a Thursday in a cold January day when i was brought into the office and was told my services were no longer required. I was let go of the company after working for them for 3 years, and I was scared for what was to come but in the same breath can say i was relieved. I drove home thinking what now. I remember the moment i got home i got in my car drove to my wifes job and had a coffee with her and she told me some of the best advice i was ever to get. Take care of yourself and find your path. With that advice i went on unemployment and sought a direction. I took a course in EMT and landed 2nd best in the class, got a job in it but found that the medical profession was something i was not really into. Then i got a call from some old friends about a job opening. NOw being that this job was in a field i was all to familiar with and something i actually loved, i jumped on the chance. The interview came and went and was then offered my pay for approval. When i learned of this i never seen such pay before, this is a real career i thought to myself and ran around the block with joy. Working at my current company i must say i have no need to look back but i do think of how it created me. I look forward to continue to progress in my career and have even thought about going back to college to further my career within the company."
