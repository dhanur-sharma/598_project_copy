        "Summarize the following story in first person: In March, I found out I was pregnant after years of trying and multiple losses (early miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies, etc). My husband and I were overjoyed, doubly so when we found out it was twins. Around 8 weeks we were told that twin A was not growing very well and likely would not make it, but twin B was right on target. At 10 weeks we were told that twin A had passed away,  but twin B was very strong and perfect statistically speaking. At 12 weeks we went for a high level ultrasound to find out our remaining twins gender as well as see if all the anatomy was correct. We went in expecting good news as we do not have any type of genetic or chromosomal disorders in our families and we had made it to the 2nd trimester. We had told our parents a few days ahead of our appointment. During the ultrasound, the tech was very quiet. We asked her if she could tell just the gender and she said no. We asked for pictures and she did not want to give us any. Then she left the room quickly and a team of 4 doctors came in. The lead doctor explained that the baby had a large cystic hygroma as well as hydrops. They told us that hydrops babies almost never make it until birth - roughly 5% survive until birth and those that do can have severe issues such as spinal bifida, downs syndrome, heart defects, dwarfism, etc. They encouraged us that day to terminate the pregnancy, which was very difficult to even hear since we are Catholic. We went from being exceptionally happy to our world ending within just a few minutes. Neither one of us wanted to believe that this bad news was possible - we had already started discussing baby names even! We went home in a daze and spent the next few weeks mainly in bed crying, trying to decide what to do. When we went for our 15 week appointment, we found out the baby had passed away on its own, which required going through the labor and delivery process the next day. It doesn't seem possible or fair that we lost not just one, but TWO babies in the same pregnancy. It was the most traumatic event of both of our lives. I am just now starting to function normally again, months later. None of the tests can explain why this happened to us and we are terrified it will happen again in the future."
