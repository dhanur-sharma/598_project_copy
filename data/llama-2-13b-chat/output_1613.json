        "Summarize the following story in first person: I had to decide. Should I look in my wife's briefcase or not? She had left it on the kitchen table when she had to run out for a few minutes after getting back from work late. I wasn't even sure what I would be looking for. Broadly speaking, I was going to look for the truth. Just what was the truth \u2014 the reality \u2014 of our marriage? The situation was that our 17 year marriage was in serious trouble. During the last few years my wife had seemed out of sorts with me. To her, nothing I did was right. Our sex life had also dwindled away to nothing. My attempts to talk were met with lectures about how the only problem was me. I needed to understand that married life with young kids meant intimacy was not on the priory list. Kids as well as her career came first. I also needed to stop being overly sensitive about perceived slights from her when, according to her, there were none. I didn't know it at the time but she was totally gaslighting me. The last thing she wanted was an honest heart-to-heart talk. In the last few months the situation had gotten much worse. It turned out she had been having an affair with a good friend of mine for over two years. She swore how that one affair was all there was and that it was now over. We were going to start marriage counseling in a week. I had to push her to agree to go but at least she had finally acquiesced."

I opened the briefcase and started looking through the contents. I found some letters and cards from my friend to her. I also found a journal she had kept for the last two years. I read it all. It was all about how she had been unhappy in our marriage and how she had been sleeping with my friend to make herself feel better. She had been lying to me about everything. I felt like I had been punched in the gut. I felt so angry and betrayed. I had to get out of there so I left the kitchen and went to my home office to calm down. I didn't know what I was going to do next.\n\n"
