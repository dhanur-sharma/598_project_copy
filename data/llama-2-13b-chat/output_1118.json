        "Summarize the following story in first person: Two months ago I moved to a new city after accepting a new job at a software company. I left behind my family, my friends, my co-workers and all my contacts. I rented a new place and am still settling in. I'm still getting to know the city and my new environment. I don't knwo anybody really well so I'll admit to feeling kind of lost. Butt I am hopeful things will get better for me and I will adjust to my surroundings and new way of life soon. I like my new job, so far. My new co-workers have been surprisingly friendly and accepting and I met one co-worker who seems to have a lot in common with me. Wew both moves for the job and we've both had to adjust to this new city life but he's been here longer than I have so I expect to learn a thing or two from him. We've gone out to lunch together a few times and he's been showing me around, giving me tips on nice restaurants to eat at, how stuff at the office works and who would be good to get to knwo and get help from at work should I have questions about work. My supervisor is easy to get along with too which is a new experience for me. He has been very welcoming and helpful and patient as I get adjusted. I like working at the new company so far and I like this new city but sometimes I feel lonely and miss home and my old friends whom I try to keep in touch with. I expect it might take a few months before I feel at home here and I also expect to take a few trips home to visit family and friends to take care of how homesick I've been feeling. the most memorable thing that has happened to me so far since I moved has been meeting this beautiful and delightful neighbor whom I've chatted with a few times and gone out on a few dates with. She is friendly and just fun to eb around and I'll admit she makes getting adjusted to my new environment pleasant. I wake up and think of her first thing in the morning and I wonder what we will do the next time we hang out together. I think I might be falling in love. I think she might feel the same way about me as well. She and I seem to have a lot in common. We lie the same music, the same books, the same movies. We enjoy playing video games which is rare for a female friend of mine. I want t get to knwo her better. I hope she will be the best thing about moving to this new place. I suspect she might be."
