        "Summarize the following story in first person: Three years ago my wife and I decided that it was time for us to permanently separate, and to file for a divorce. It was a hard decision to make for the both of us. Initially we decided to come upon an agreement on who would have our children during the school week, weekends, and holidays. This is something we were not able to agree upon, and we knew that we both needed a lawyer. I had a feeling that this was going to be a nasty battle between us. Unfortunately, I was correct, the battle ended up being drawn out for three years. By this time the kids actually became of legal age to decide where they wanted to stay. To my surprise our children decided that they wanted to stay with me. Come to find out their mother had started seeing another mate who were abusive towards my Ex and our children. He had a drinking problem, and became violent when he drank. Our children have fond memories of when me and my Ex were together, and knew what a normal household would run like. The case was drawn out over the three years due to lack of proof showing that my Ex was an unfit mother and having an unstable household for our children to reside full time in. During those three years I worked on purchasing a home, and I thought it was necessary to remain single during this time. I felt my children did not need their dad to get into a relationship whenever they already had enough stress on their shoulders. I remember the day like yesterday whenever we were at court, and it was proved that my Ex was not only an unfit mother, but was unable to provide a stable home environment. Also, on top of everything our children each confessed to the courtroom how they prefer to reside in my home due to the hostile environment that they were encountering between my Ex and her new mate. They confessed how this was affecting them in school as well with their social lives. This ended with me winning full custody of my children last month during our last court hearing."
