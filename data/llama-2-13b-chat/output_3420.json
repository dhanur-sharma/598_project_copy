        "Summarize the following story in first person: I love my family more than anything in this world. especially my two boy. and i have to provide for them and the best way for that was two months ago. i had an opportunity to go overseas to make some decent cash. and i took the opportunity. but i didn't know what i was getting into. i was excited for the opportunity and going to the Dominican republic which is where my parents are from. but a week into the business trip i got home sickness or son sickness. I missed my sons so bad and strangely when i was visiting my father who lives in the Dominican republic that sadness hit me so bad. I saw how happy and sad my dad was and i became just sad. and i was going to be sad for 4 more weeks. even that motivation for money for my sons to give them a better life didn't subside my guilt. i was telling my dad about my feeling and he just laughed because he's been feeling this way most of his life. and i started to laugh and hanging with my dad was great. so after the 5 weeks i went back home and the relief  had when i saw my babies. and now i never wasn't to leave them."
