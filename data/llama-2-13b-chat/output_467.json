        "Summarize the following story in first person: Dear Journal,I can't believe it actually happened. After barely speaking to her, my mother finally apologized for everything that she put me through. This all happened around 5 months ago when I got a call from mom telling me that she wanted us to have lunch. I was completely shocked to hear from her. I really didn't want to go, but she seemed dead set on having us meet over lunch. When the day finally came for us to meet, I started remembering all of the emotional abuse that she put me through growing up. I drove to the new Italian place in town that she wanted us to have lunch at. She was already there sitting at a small table outside. We greeted each other as friendly as we both could and we ordered our food. I finally broke the awkward small talk and asked her why she wanted to meet out of the blue. Thats when it happened. She started crying and asking for my forgiveness. While continuing crying, she apologized for all of the things that she did to me. I was starting to get embarrassed as other people were looking over at our table. Awhile ago I had said that I would never forgive her for the constant insults and verbal abuse that she hurled at me over the years. But in that moment, I saw the sincerity and remorse in her eyes. She wanted to try to fix the things that she had done. I accepted her apology and we had started the first step in rebuilding our relationship. Its only been five months since this day, but I am proud of the progress that my mother and I have made. We talk regularly know and I feel closer to her then ever before."
