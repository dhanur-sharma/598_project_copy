        "Summarize the following story in first person: I recently went on a family vacation to Destin, Florida. This event took place roughly two months ago. What made this trip so special was the fact that it was the first time my children have ever been to the beach. I have a son who is five and a daughter who is three. Another special moment on this trip was we went with friends and family. While we were down there, we got to meet up with a special person in my life that I served with in the United States Marine Corps. I had not seen this friend for five years so it was a great reunion for us to get together and catch up. While in Destin, Florida, we stayed at a condo that was right on the beach. The views from our room were amazing and the water was crystal clear. We were also amazed at how beautiful and white the sand was. It felt like we were walking on silk. Aside from hanging out on the beach all day, we also went to out to eat at some very nice restaurants. I got to eat some fresh seafood. We're from Ohio so the seafood we can get in Florida is not like the seafood we can get in Ohio. On one of the nights we went out to play miniature golf. On another night, we went and rode go-carts with the kids. The duration of the trip was a week-long. I wish we could have stayed longer as we had such a fun time. I feel like the trip went by very fast. We plan on coming back to Destin, Florida next year as we liked it so much. Honestly, this was one of the most memorable trips I have ever been on. I will keep the memories of this trip forever in my mind."
