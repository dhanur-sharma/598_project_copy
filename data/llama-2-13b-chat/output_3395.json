        "Summarize the following story in first person: Well it's been two months now and my lump of a husband still won't listen to me. I know in the past I've had some money making ideas which didn't work, but this time it's different. In the ad they said anyone could do it and that was all I needed to get started. I don't know why Harry won't listen to me. He's not the one who has to manage the finances. The kids need new back-to-school clothes and we really need something extra coming in. The whole thing is really simple. I demonstrate Miracle Health to people, they buy it and we make money. Even Harry could do it. And when anyone signs up under me I get a commission for everything they sell. It's just so perfect for us. If I could only get that couch potato to turn off the TV just once to pay attention to me. I never ask for anything for myself, you would think just once he would cooperate and do this for the family. I've tried everything I could think of to try and get it through his thick skull. I think it's time to call the Psychic Hotline and see if they can give me some advice."
