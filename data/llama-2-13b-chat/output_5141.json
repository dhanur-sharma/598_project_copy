        "Summarize the following story in first person: When I think of my child leaving for college and the regret of what I should have said or done but didn't screams in my soul that my beloved daughter heads off to college in Texas. Her departure very much feels like \u201cThe End.\u201d She\u2019s excited about her new adventure. Most important is the fact that she\u2019s excited about going.  You aren't doing anything wrong\u2014this is just a normal part of growing up. Teens who are trying to find independence need to differentiate themselves from parents and family and express their own strong opinions and ideas of how things should be done. Don't conclude that your child has always hated you and that their real nature is coming out now that they're leaving for college. It's just part of the separation process and is a temporary stage of development. Don't take it to heart; it's not your child talking\u2014it's the fear of leaving home and entering the adult world that's lashing out at you. Many parents use social media to keep track of their kids at college and ask their children to \"friend\" them so they can maintain contact. . Part of growing up involves facing difficult or challenging moments and finding a way through those hard times. Signs of maturity include flexibility, adaptability, and resilience, and college is the ideal time to work on these skills. But if situations escalate to the point at which they threaten your child's physical or mental health\u2014or put them in jeopardy\u2014step in and offer aid. But ask for permission first. You want to support your child as much as possible but not to the extent that you dismantle the initial foundation of self-sufficiency. Finding the right balance will take time, but eventually, you'll both get there."
