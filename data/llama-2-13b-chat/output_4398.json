        "Summarize the following story in first person: The day that I got my Excel internship was very memorable. I had been looking for an opportunity to train on more complicated processes as my career had been relatively stagnant, and finally someone took notice of my potential. This was just the encouragement I needed to really hit the books (so to speak) and since then, I feel like I am 10x the analyst I used to be. My office comes to me for help now. Managers recommend my services to other teams. I have become so much more dedicated to learning. I've completed multiple online programming courses. I've spent countless hours practicing formulas, writing code, and watching tutorials. I even got my library card so I'd have access to more resources. This day changed everything, and I feel like I know my purpose now. I hope to continue pursuing this, and one day have the opportunity to move to Norway because of it (they allow engineers to get Visas). I will have enough money to afford a better life. I'll have enough to be satisfied. Maybe I can even start a family. All because someone gave me a shot."
