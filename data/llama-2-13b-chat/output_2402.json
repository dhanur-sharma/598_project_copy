        "Summarize the following story in first person: I recent was the best man at a friend wedding and was required to give a speech.  I was very nervous about giving the speech and proceeded to drink quite a bit in order to give myself the courage to stand in front of all of the people I didn't personally know and speak to them.  Incidentally, I was also the first person to speak and the master of ceremonies didn't give much warning as to when the speeches would begin.  My speech went well and at one point I realized that both the bride and her mother were crying, tears of joy I hope.  After the speeches, I proceeded to have a great time and enjoy the celebration.  It is self centered, but I was glad that I gave the speech that received the most applause and created the greatest emotional reaction from the bride and her family.  The bride's mother came to me at one point and thanked me for my heartfelt speech. The wedding proceeded without much event.  People were happy and danced and socialized.  About thirty minutes later, I realized that outside of the moment in which I was giving the speech, nobody really cared what I had to say.  They were there for the bride and groom.  The fear that I had felt was rooted in my own insecurities and nobody else really cares about my insecurities because, for the most part, they are all focused on their own. After the wedding, the bride and groom thanked me.  I took more satisfaction in the bride thanking me than I did from the applause or congratulations that I received.  Fear almost caused me to fail, because I was pretty tipsy when I went up on the stage.  I'm glad that all worked out well."

It is good that I was able to overcome my fear and deliver a great speech.  It is also good that I was able to see the bigger picture and understand that it was not about me, but about the celebration of the bride and groom.  I was able to be selfless and focus on the celebration rather than my own insecurities."
