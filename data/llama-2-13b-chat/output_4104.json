        "Summarize the following story in first person: I remember the day very well. We had just settled into playing some board games when my sister started making some panicked breathing. We thought it was a panic attack, but she pointed to her stomach area and we realized it was the contractions that was making her breath so heavily. Her husband asked her to indicate on fingers what the pain was at, and she held up nine fingers. He then asked if she thought we should go to the hospital, she vigorously nodded her head. Without a second thought, everyone jumped up and my brother-in-law went to go retrieve the hospital bag. Their car had some issues, so my BIL asked if I would take them to the hospital. Still in a state of surprise, I agreed and went to go warm up the car. My BIL and sister came out of the house and I showed them to the backseat. I got in the driver's seat and began driving to the hospital. My sister continued to make deep, long breaths and she was trying to relieve the pain any way she could. I drove as fast I could without being at risk of being pulled over. We made it to the hospital after what seemed like hours and I dropped them off near the entrance. I asked if they wanted me to stick around and my BIL said that that would be fine. I know they had their car in the shop but there wasn't anything we could do about it right now. I parked the car and went up to delivery rooms. I chose not to be inside, at least for the first little bit, and waited for the baby to be delivered! Thankfully, everything worked out. The suddenness of the baby coming makes the event stick out so much in my mind."
