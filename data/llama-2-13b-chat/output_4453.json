        "Summarize the following story in first person: my daughter joined boyscouts just recently in february of this year. that is when they let girls join so she is a founder of the troop. since she has joined she has worked super hard to first make scout rank then tenderfoot. she also attended summer camp and worked on badges. anyway about three weeks ago was her court of honor. that is where they reconize the girls and the moms for all the hard work because scouts is family base. anyway at the court of honor when she made tenderfoot i went up also and she pinned a rank pin on me. thats part of it as we are scout moms and get reconition also. i was so proud of her and so proud of us. now i was really suprised how many badges the girls earned. they earned so many in so little time. being a scout mom makes me so proud. it makes me proud of what my daughter is achieving and also what she is learning along the way. this was a very memorable event and im its only one of many more to come. we will see what is next."
