        "Summarize the following story in first person: My daughter father died before her first birthday.  He was involved in a fatal car crash.  And I remember every detail like it was yesterday.  It was 4 days before her first birthday - April 4, 2019. We were excitedly planning her birthday party, and hoping the nice weather would hold so we could rent a bounce house and host a bbq.   He had a tattoo that he wanted to have finished before the party so he could show it off to our friends and family.  It was a nice piece with her name on it and just needed some final touches.  He went with his sister because she wanted some work done too.  It was getting late, and no one was home.  I couldn't get either of them on the phone and I was getting worried.   I eventually fell asleep on the couch and was awakened by someone pounding on the door.  It scared the crap out of me because I had left the door unlocked, so I knew it wasn't Matt.  I opened the door at 4am to be greeted by 4 police officers to tell me that Matt had hit some black ice and slid across the highway and crashed into another vehicle head on.  He, his sister, and the other driver died instantly.  They felt it necessary to tell me that he must have been distracted because he had a handful of CDs in his hand.  I knew that the passenger was ALWAYS his DJ and he only did it himself when he was mad at the passenger.  He and his sister fought a lot - I have always blamed her for it.   It has taken us many much time, but we have slowly moved is on and made a nice life for ourselves.  My daughter is still dealing with it, but has shown great strength in dealing with it.  It took me a little longer to get past my sorrow and guilt (I should've went along and drove) but we are doing okay now.  I know he is watching over us."
