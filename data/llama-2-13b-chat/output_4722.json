        "Summarize the following story in first person: My grandmother passed away late this summer. Her health had been in decline for years so while it wasn't unexpected it was still difficult. After she lost the ability to walk to diabetes we moved her to a nearby nursing home that specialized in employing caretakers that spoke our native language. There weren't many choices and my father worked hard to get her into this particular one which was highly regarded in the community. We visited her at least once and often two or three times a week to bring her meals to help her adjust. Unfortunately she never quite adjusted to the loss of freedom and autonomy. This went on for about four years and despite how routine it was every visit was different. Sometimes she'd have conflicts with other residents and sometimes with nurses and caretakers. She changed rooms five times during her stay which I believe was more than anyone else has. Every attempt to make things better seemed to have made some things worse. I simultaneously feared going back every week and got terribly anxious being away. Probably the biggest challenge was getting her to eat enough. She hated the food so we tried to bring her home cooked meals as often as we could but this only made her dislike the nursing home's food even more. We kept her fridge fully stocked at all times but because she hated the nursing home food so much she felt the need to save food from home for a later time. Early this year after a particularly bad illness she stopped eating altogether and had to be forced. She passed away a few months after that. She was hospitalized to find the issue and when they found cancer in her liver they determined that there was nothing they could do. We visited more often for a few weeks before that and we were with her when she passed. It shocked me how quickly everyone expected to act. The funeral was arranged within the next half hour and the nursing home pressed us to clean out the room. The wake and funeral came quick and everyone in our small family that didn't seem to care much until now seemed to care a lot. My grandmother's sister brought many strangers from her church, and the majority of people who attended were strangers. I'm still not sure how to feel about the whole ordeal. It's been an exhausting four years."
