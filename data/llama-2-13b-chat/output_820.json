        "Summarize the following story in first person: My brother visiting my family and I back in May was a memorable event as we took my three kids to a baseball game, which was my youngest daughter's first game.  She was very excited the entire trip to the game, which takes about two hours of driving.  She only slept part of the way despite having to wake up somewhat early on Sunday.  Once there, she held my hand the entire way through the parking lot, security and to our seats.  She spent the majority of the 7 innings of our stay watching the crowd, random events on the field and eating delicious ballpark food.  My two oldest had already been to baseball games, but were excited to be doing so with their uncle.  They spent the entire game also eating ballpark foods, but primarily talked to their uncle about everything they were seeing.  My brother and I got to see our favorite team play, despite losing.  We only see each other once or twice a year at this stage of our lives, so we value our time together.  We typically reminisce about our childhood and talk sports all day.  We both love the same teams as we grew up in the same area.  Our sports teams do not have a history of excellence, but we love them relentlessly nonetheless.  After the game, we headed home for another two hours.  We stopped about halfway to grab dinner at a location my kids really enjoy.  They all ended their long day with a shake and all three fell asleep before we reached home.  It was a memorable day with their uncle."
