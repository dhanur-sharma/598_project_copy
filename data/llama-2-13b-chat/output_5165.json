        "Summarize the following story in first person: I recently had an unexpected allergic reaction to some antibiotics I was taking to treat strep throat. I first noticed a large rash forming on my stomach and immediately felt concerned. I looked up some possible side effects from the antibiotic and sure enough a rash was one of them. I notified my doctor and he told me to stop taking the antibiotics and he would call in another medicine to the pharmacy that would clear up the reaction but it would possible make me feel very tired and unable to do much for a couple of days. I told my husband about the situation and he said he had some sick days saved up anyhow and he would take two days off to help take care of me. I felt so relieved because I knew I would be unable to keep up with cooking, housework and caring for the children on my own. He prepared homeade pancakes the first morning and brought me the pancakes and juice in bed. He made a point to do all of the dishes and then took our children out to the park while I got some much needed rest. He brought home dinner from my favorite Italian restaurant. I enjoyed my chicken piccata in front of the TV while we all watched a family movie. I began to feel a little dizzy after dinner so my husband held me up and helped me into bed. He brought me a glass of water and my medication and told me to relax. I was so incredibly grateful he was able to take care of me. I feel lucky to have married such and loving person who is so selfless. If I did not have my husband to help take care of me during that time when I was recovering I don't know what I would have done. I truly do feel like he is my soulmate."
