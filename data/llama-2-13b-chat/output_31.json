        "Summarize the following story in first person: I fell down a flight of stairs in my home, in the wee hours of the morning, last January.  The thing of it is,  I was not on my way downstairs.  I was going from my bathroom to my upstairs sitting room, which is right next to the stairs.  I normally have no problem with this but i neglected  to turn on the lights in the hallway and I was unable to see where I was going.  I have glaucoma, so it is very hard for me to see in low light conditions.  I was totally unaware of the peril, as I was making my way out of the bathroom and my first sensation as I felt myself falling was surprise.  I did not feel shock or horror; it was just a feeling of knowing what was happening and being surprised that it was happening.  I remember hitting the steps on my right side, my full weight on my right shoulder and I believed I heard a voice telling me exactly what was happening.  It was like my brain was giving me an instant damage report.  Maybe it was real or maybe it was just the result of me hitting my head.  But, tht is the one thing I most remember about the incident.  I ended up twisted in an odd position on the first landing of the steps and my right foot had broken through one of the banister railings.  I layed there for a few moments, not yet feeling the pain, but knowing that I was hurt badly.  My mother came from out of her room to attend to me, trying to help me up at first, but when I screamed in pain after she pulled my arm, I just told her to call for help.  The EMTs arrived quickly  and I think I  must have ruined their night.  They questioned me like I meant to fall down the stairs and then didn't bother to brink a stretcher to move me to the ambulance.  They grabbed my by my arms and pulled me down the stairs , out of the house and into the ambulance like I was a soldier being evacuated from a battlefield.  I was in pain and pissed."

My right shoulder was shattered and my right foot was broken.  I have no memory of the hospital stay or the recovery.  My mom and dad were with me the whole time and they told me that i was a real trooper.  I have no idea what they were talking about.  I do know that it was the most painful experience of my life and I will never forget it.  I am still dealing with the after effects of that fall and the damage to my eyesight.  I can't even walk down the stairs without feeling the pain.  I am still pissed about the whole thing.  But, I guess I am lucky to be alive.  Maybe that is what they were talking about."
