        "Summarize the following story in first person: Now this happened some six months ago. It was a weekend evening and we were supposed to be out enjoying with friends. But it rained that day and we had to stay indoors. That's when we decided to watch a movie together on TV. So me, my parents and my younger brother, we got ready in front of the TV. Least i expected was that the movie turned out to be a murder thriller where some guy is killed and the search for the murderer seemed to be the plot.  When the movie was over & we got up to go to bed, my dad looked at us, especially towards me. He then said that he too had faced a similar situation before. I couldn't get what that was about. That's when he told us the story which left us completely shocked. My dad started to tell a story about how he murdered a guy. I was completely horrified. A lot was running through my mind like - who when how and why, what must have happened and who the guy was. And then suddenly my dad looking at my face, started laughing hysterically and kept saying that he couldn't believe i fell for his lie & that how could i even think that he killed someone. Obviously he was right, but i must say he's a pro and was completely convincing with his lie. What finally punched me was when he called me - April Fool."
