        "Summarize the following story in first person: My best friend and I had been through something that had us not speaking to one another. It started out over something really stupid. I really didn't believe what happened to cause it was really a big deal but to her it was. She had sent me a really ugly message after it happened and called me a few choice names. I didn't say anything ugly back to her.  I kept trying to fix things but nothing worked. Finally one day she got over it and everything has been fine ever since. I was so glad that she finally got over what happened and realized it was all very stupid. Now things are fine between us and we hope to keep them that way. She's always meant a lot to me and I don't want anything to ever come between us again. I never wanted things the way they were for a while but I don't think she really cared one way or another. Especially with the things that she said to me. I would never have said the things to her that she said to me but it's all good now and we're both over it. I really hope that nothing ever happens between us again like that. I hate things were like that."
