        "Summarize the following story in first person: Today was my graduation. I spent 5 years in college for this moment and I couldn't be happier. My friends and family came to see me and cheer me on. It made me smile so much to hear them from the audience. I didn't think anyone would come, so this was a great surprise.  When I walked across that stage, it felt like my whole life was going somewhere. I could feel how big of an accomplishment this was. I'm nervous, too, though. I have a degree and am a part of a professional organization now. I have new responsibilities and obligations. I'm worried that I won't be able to live up to it all. That maybe I'll fail and let everyone down. I'm also nervous about working with actual clients. I worked with a few during school, but this is different. Mistakes here could be life changing. I think I'll do alright, though. I just need to remember the good feelings and remember that I am trained and qualified. Damn it's an exciting time right now."
