        "Summarize the following story in first person: My daughter actually started school for the first time just 3 months ago. Although she was so excited. We had a long talk about this few weeks ago, But i could also see tears in her eyes that she would miss me. At this time i became so emotional and started to think about all the fun times we shared together and it just dawned on me that life is in stages. There would be a time i will no longer live under the same roof with her and tears rolled down my checks. I love her so much. I know definitely i cant be with her forever but i promise to always support her and stand by her. She will always be my baby girl. I remember when i was in graduate school how she would always say Daddy I AM PROUD OF YOU. it always gets me so emotional and i always tell her i will be proud of her forever. My daughter is very smart and she always tells me that she wants to be s surgeon when she grows up. She is so focused at every thing she does. She always wants to know more about things around her and i love that about her. My daughter is very active she loves to exercise and live a healthy life. I know i will miss my daughter as she starts a new journey in life but i know it is the sacrifice i need to make to give my child a bright future,Anytime i think about her first day at school i get so emotional but am happy at the same time. She means the whole world to me and i am grateful she is my daughter. I will continue to do everythingin my power to make her the best version of herself."
