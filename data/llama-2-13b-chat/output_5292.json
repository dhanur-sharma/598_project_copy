        "Summarize the following story in first person: GW was an elderly family friend who lived next door to my uncle. My uncle owned a business and GW and I worked both worked there for a while. GW was the strong silent type but he loved jokes and pranks. He got a wicked sense of humor and he was well liked. His wife AW used to tutor my sister after school. GW was a US Army veteran and fought in the Korea War so we also had that in common since I served in the Marines during OIF. After I moved on to a different job I still kept in touch with GW. One day my uncle got a call from AW saying that GW was in the hospital. He had some form of terminal cancer and he would like to to see us. Sensing that this could be the last chance to see GW I took my uncle and my aunt with me and we went to visit him at the hospital. When we first got there GW was asleep. He looked so pale and frail like he had shrunk a few sizes. It shocked me to see him in this weakened state. The GW I remember was this funny, gentle giant with strong hands but here he was in a hospital bed. A sick old man, helpless and dying. I got a bit choked up watching him. We asked a nurse to woke him and when he came to he was slightly confused at first but recognized us quickly. He grasped my right hand and I felt how cold and weak his hand was. I let him hold mine for a while because I felt like he didn't wan to let go yet. We asked him how he was feeling and told him we'll wait for him when he come home although we knew it was unlikely. After we left I couldn't shake the image of GW in the hospital and I felt a bit sad and melancholy. The next day afternoon we got another call from AW that GW had passed away in the morning."
