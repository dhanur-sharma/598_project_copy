        "Summarize the following story in first person: 2 months ago my most favorite cat Miki died. I felt like my precious friend has died. It was the saddest moment of my life. He was 3 years old and died from bathroom hair drier Electric short circuit. He was quite a naughty one.  Always curious about everything. Unfortunately, his curiosity bought him to death. I filled the bathroom tub with water and took a bath. The hair drier was connected and on. Miki came into the bathroom. He started playing and jumping. He was playing with the hair drier as it was on. He was very curious about the hot air and sound. Suddenly he jumped off the bathroom table towards the tub. His jump also pushed the hair drier into the tub creating a short circuit with water.  I was stunned for a moment and then switched off the power. but it was too late. He died in a split moment. I berried him in the backyard of our home with his federate toys. I also made a cat house to cover his symmetry from seasonal weathers. Hope he reached cat haven.  I blamed myself for his death partially. I promised myself, I wouldn't get any more pet and will not get them accordingly killed."
