        "Summarize the following story in first person: I got fired from my job five months ago. It was a really bad time to get let go, as I was struggling at the time with mental illness. My firing occurred due to my missing work because of my condition. My work performance had slipped over the last six months prior and I had been placed on probation. It was also due to conflicts with management. I felt simply horrible and worthless. In many ways, I still do. Getting fired from my job truly changed my life. I lost my sense of purpose. At the same time, it gave me the freedom to go back to school and learn web design and coding. I have found that my passion lies in that and in creation. I am very excited for my future career now. At this time, as much as I am nervous, I am excited for the future and what it holds. My life will improve, it's just a tough time right now. I learned that no business really cares about you and the \"we are family\" line that most companies use is totally a joke. They can and will fire you no matter what."
