        "Summarize the following story in first person: About seven and a half months ago I found out the greatest news in the world.  The news I found out was that I am going to be a father.  A couple months after we found out that we were pregnant we found out it is going to be a girl!  We knew the name that we were going to name her right away.   It is a name that when we heard we knew we would name our little girl if we ever had one.  I can't begin to describe how happy my wife and I are.  I think about my future daughter every single day.  It makes me so happy to think about the memories to come.  I have been doing as much research as I can on being a dad.  I am concerned about not knowing everything that I need to know when it comes to that.  But I just keep telling my self that know one knows everything.  That there are some things that are important facts to know.  However, That sometimes I have to just trust my instincts on some things.  So while it does cause me some anxiety overall I am so over the moon happy.  This was the best event in my life ever."
