        "Summarize the following story in first person: I remember when I was accused of something that I didn't do. An aunt thought that I didn't answer the door on purpose when she came over. It was years ago, but still very upsetting as it was a close relative.  I didn't think they would ever think I would do something like that. I believe she knew I didn't do what she accused me of as it was very stupid and meaningless. I just don't think she ever thought she could say she was wrong or sorry. I believe she got mixed up, went to the wrong apartment or was just simply mistaken. I'm the type that would have answered the door, but explained there were other things I needed to do. I certainly wouldn't have just not opened the door. Everyone in my family mentioned that to her. She was very stubborn and always thought she was a bit better than everyone else morally.  I did apologize just because my mother asked me to. It was easier to do that than let my mom be upset. But, it was never the same with us. When I would see her at holidays or other family occasions, I always felt resentful. I am one of the most responsible people in my family and took it to heart. I don't think that my relationship would ever be repaired with her."
