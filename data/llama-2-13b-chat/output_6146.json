        "Summarize the following story in first person: About two months ago, I ran into someone I thought I'd never see again.  The last time we talked was about 10 years ago before he moved away.  When we first met, I was a teenager hanging out at the arcade.  I still remember him walking in, laughing with two of his friends.  My whole world felt like it tilted and I was smitten.  We became friends, went out a few times, but nothing serious.  Then life got in the way as we became adults, and all we did to follow each other was occasionally post Happy Birthday on facebook.  So, when I saw him recently walking into a Starbuck's locally, I followed him in, forgetting about the return I was going to make to the shoe store next door.  I called out his name, and we hugged.    We then sat down with our beverages and reminisced.  I recounted how \"in love\" with him I was during our teenage years, holding back that seeing him gave me butterflies.  Even now I feel the fluttering just writing this down.  You see, we are both married, happily, and have children.  Obviously, nothing could happen between us at this point in our lives.  Some feelings just never go away though.  It was nice seeing him, even for that half hour before he returned back to his new town."
