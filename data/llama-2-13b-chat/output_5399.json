        "Summarize the following story in first person: The most memorable event that happened to me four months is the arrival of my first born son on June 5th. I cant stop thinking about it. It was amazing. The  entire labor and delivery took about an hour and 45 minutes and that was the most surprising part . Our baby boy arrived at 6:42 am. He was 8 Lb . Our family was complete. I still get emotional just thinking about it and how tears of joy drop down my face for the first time. My wife was in awe at how serene i was during the birth. It was everything i had hoped for. A beautiful, gentle start for our baby. I felt such overwhelming waves of love. Everything felt perfect and wonderful. All our family and friends were there to meet the little one. He had jet black hair like his daddy. I couldn't stop gazing into his squinting eyes and stroking his wet little head. Remembering that day still makes me weepy."
