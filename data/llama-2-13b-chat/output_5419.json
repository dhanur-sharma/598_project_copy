        "Summarize the following story in first person: Wow so something that was striking and or memorable that I can recall this would be tough since I really haven't been doing much in the last six months. but I guess the most memorable thing that I can recall is that lately I have been tasked with learning about a new operating system. at work that Is basically for production of materials and it greatly effects my current job and they had to send me out to Chicago a few times. so that I can get some extra training and this went on for a few weeks .and then they sent me to Ohio also for further training and in the meantime I am staying at random hotels. and eating at some unusual restaurants like the weber grill which is actually pretty goodand a few other random places normally I wouldn't eat at. back home like Portillos or Giordanos which was super awesome pizza, and the culture in Chicago. was way different from where I am from the diversity and the fact that a lot of people were speaking spanish. was a bit of culture shock for me but everyone is super friendly at the places I went to. and was doing my training.  I would for sure go back someday with my kids and kind of show them some of the places that I visited. in my spare time when I wasn't working like Wrigley stadium and some of the museums. and even the city which is actually pretty clean as far as city's tend to go at least compared to the city I live in.   This is something I would probably never do again but it would be fun to maybe visit someday.   Ohio was ok it was kind of boring in comparison though to Chicago and I probably wont visit.  They did however have some nice people and good places to just get a beer and that is always a good thing."
