        "Summarize the following story in first person: About a week ago, my son, who is 9 months, was playing on the floor in the living room. I turned away for a split second and next thing I know, he stood up and started to walk towards me! My other son, who is 5 years old, started yelling \"He's walking!\" I could not believe it! He was actually walking! Not just taking a step and falling. No, he was practically running! Okay, maybe not that fast, but they were definitely not baby steps. He had been taking a few steps here and there, walking with the assistance of us or the couch, but never just standing up on his own and walking! I was so excited! Maybe to excited because we were so loud yelling \"he's walking, o my goodness,\" that he fell shortly after. My husband had just went into the garage. He ran in the house, but had missed his first steps. He was sad that he missed it. We had him walk again for his Dad and so we could get it on video to send to our family. It was a wonderful moment and a memory that will of course stick with us forever. We were so excited to see our little one walking!"
