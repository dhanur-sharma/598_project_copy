        "Summarize the following story in first person: Two months ago, in a desperate attempt to get my position back, I volunteered to set up the science olympiad at school. I had been moved into the math department due to a lack of funding. I was desperate to get back into the science department. I was licensed to teach both subjects, but I hated math. And more importantly, my students hated math. I figured if I could pull off the olympiad event I might make a good impression on the superintendent. I started getting everything together and realized it was going to be a lot of work. I had to get enough kids to participate, get parents to help, and get donations. I was doing pretty well and then I got a phone call that the school had decided to include the younger grade levels as well. All the work I had just done had to be redone, and at three times as much. Somehow I managed to pull it off. The event went perfectly, the kids all had fun. I looked really good and I was anxious to see if the SUperintendent would notice. The next day at school I was immediately called into his office. He was so impressed with my organization that he decided I belonged in the science department! I could have my old position back effective immediately. I was so happy I could have cried."
