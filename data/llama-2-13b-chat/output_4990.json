        "Summarize the following story in first person: We walked into the funeral home and there he was: my girlfriends grandpa, laying peacefully in his casket. He had passed just a few days prior and many in the family were torn up about it. I had known him to be a decent guy. Like many older people I meet, he was a little brash and a little racist, but if he liked you, he treated you well. He always treated me well, but I had heard stories about him that suggested he wasn\u2019t always the best person. But I never want to see death and I felt sad for the family about it regardless. When it came time for anyone to say a few words about him, no one said anything, which I found odd. I almost wanted to just out of pure awkwardness. I\u2019ve only been to a handful of viewings and one other funeral in my life, so I never really know quite what to do or say or what others are supposed to do or say, but it just didn\u2019t feel right. I didn\u2019t ask about it, though, in case I were to offend anyone. Some cried, so I knew they felt emotional, but maybe they just didn\u2019t know what to say. It\u2019s hard telling, really. In the end, it was just several hours of me feeling weird, uncomfortable and awkward. But it wasn\u2019t about me, so I didn\u2019t make it about me. I was there for her family and that\u2019s what counted."
