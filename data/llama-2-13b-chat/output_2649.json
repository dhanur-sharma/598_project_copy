        "Summarize the following story in first person: I finally took the next step in my career at the beginning of July when I landed a new job. I had been stuck in a more entry-level IT job for three years, during which time I never got any promised raises. I even took a slight pay cut to start a career in IT after having been in print media layout for two decades. I have been looking for awhile, and came close to great jobs twice, but I never got out of that rut before now. I worked very hard sending out more than 100 resumes in my area and in other cities in Tennessee and even Florida. Finally, a small local company noticed my resume on a job site and called me. Initially, I was worried about this job because I couldn't see if it was right for the next phase in my career. But I figured I should interview, if for no other reason than I needed the practice for other job opportunities. When I went to the first interview, I liked the company, and I saw that I could use a variety of IT disciplines. The primary job is hardware/software help desk, but I get to use my data and networking skills too. I agreed to a second interview, but I needed a big increase in pay. I got the job offer, which was $50 more a week. However, I got another $70 a week for healthcare. My wife carries our insurance, so the overall effect is $120 per week. I jumped on the job and have loved it. I cut my commute by almost 60 miles a day, and I have almost 1.5 hours more that I am not spending driving to and from work. I also feel a lot better since I don't spend most of the day dreading being at work. I am so happy I found this new job."
