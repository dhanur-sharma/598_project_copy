        "Summarize the following story in first person: I can't believe it's been four months since we last saw our friend Brian. He invited us over for a Saturday afternoon party and we knew we had to be there. Brian lives a few cities over so we don't see him often, but he gathered all of our best friends from high school for a huge BBQ. There wasn't a chance in the world that we would miss it. Not only that but unbeknownst to us, they all pitched in for a massive 3-foot surprise birthday cake for us. It had military action figures on all sides, and was both chocolate and vanilla flavors at different levels. I even saw oreos and peanut butter cups on there, which are my two favorite snacks. Lately we have been talking on the phone a lot about me being deployed, so it was touching to receive such a big cake. I know Brian's brother served multiple tours a while back, so he understands what it means when a deployment is looming. Aside from the crazy cake, we had tons of food on his new industrial sized grill. He bought three types of burgers, tons of brats, hot dogs, and all the vegan options available. In addition we had at least a half dozen large coolers filled beer and water. As we chatted with old friends long into the night, I couldn't help but remember how great some of the times we used to have were. It would be a shame if our friends didn't get together like this after all we've been through, and it's especially important that we are all able to make time for the group. So regardless of my upcoming deployment situation and how that plays out, I really look forward to the next massive BBQ at Brian's house!"
