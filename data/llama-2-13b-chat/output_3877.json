        "Summarize the following story in first person: It happened. My father, who was always overweight had a heart attack. It was scary for everyone in the family and everyone was really so worried about him. I was thinking how in the world would I even live without him if he had passed on. These were horrible thoughts in my head! It all started when my dad started to feel ill. He said he was feeling week and a little shakey. I told him to go to bed for a little bit and maybe he'd feel better after a nap. He laid down, but an hour later he got back up and told me \"I think I need to go to the hospital.\" I asked him if he was feeling better, he said he was feeling worse and would feel better going to the hospital. I got dressed and got him dressed and we went to the hospital. The nurse asked for his symptoms and started getting a concerned look on her face when he was saying he had a tightness in his chest a few days before and that now he just felt weaker and weaker. She told him, \"I think you both should be prepared to spend the night tonight. I get a hunch that this is serious.\" and I looked at her and said \"What do you mean?\" and she said she'd get a doctor to explain everything. The doctor came in about 5 minutes later and said they were going to take my father down to do some tests and then asked him how he was feeling and he mumbled \"Not good.\" So they took him out and the doctor stayed with me and explained everything and how he might have had a heart attack, but won't know until he does the tests. I asked if it was serious and he said \"It could be.\" Turns out, he had had one and was getting what they said was \"kick backs\" from the first attack. The tests showed that it was worse than expected and my dad had to be wheeled into surgery for quintuple bypass surgery . I was so nervous for him, this was the most serious thing he had ever been through and it was scary for us all. When he got out, the doctor came out and told me he did fine and the surgery was successful. He just needed to take it easy and to get on a healthier diet plan. He's been doing great since then!"
