        "Summarize the following story in first person: I had decided to go spend my wife's birthday at an all inclusive resort. It was a great time to go because it was the dry season in Central America. We went with her family. I enjoyed going there because it was the first time that I went to one. What I enjoyed the most was that I could go to the buffet line and get all the food that I wanted. I didn't have to worry about tipping or ordering something off the menu. I also enjoyed the open bars. I had alot of different cocktails that I didn't know about before. I got to fill my satisfaction in that area. I also enjoyed the pool area where the entertainment possibilities were endless.  Later at night we went to the night entertainment. There were several dance routines and comedy routines. There was a cocktail bar there as well so that I could enjoy my drinks in different areas. I didn't get to go to the night party but my wife did. The rest of the time there was spent doing the same things for the next couple of days."
