        "Summarize the following story in first person: Seven months ago, my father passed away.  I remember being there, taking care of my daughter when the moment actually happened. It was a surprise to us; we didn't know he was going to pass at that moment.  But that one moment is etched in my memory.  I even remember what my daughter was wearing at that moment.  She was only 1 at the time.  At least she didn't know what was really happening and she doesn't remember that moment at all.  But I always will remember it.  I think we knew that he was going to pass at some point; he wasn't healthy and he was stubborn about going to the doctor.  He was just set in his ways.  I guess I can be happy that he met my daughter and he did live a full life.  He was only 65 when it happened, which is part of why we were surprised.  He always seemed strong to me when i was a child.  I know that no one lives forever, but it's still a surprise.  You don't know when it will happen.  Nothing can prepare you for that."

I would go through the motions of taking care of my daughter, but it was all just a fog.  I know I will always miss him.  I know that he is in a better place and I will see him again someday.  But it's still hard.  It's still hard to not have him here with me.  My daughter will never know her grandfather, but I will make sure to tell her about him all the time so that he will always be with us.  Even though he is gone, I will always remember him and cherish the memories that I have of him.  I will make sure to keep his memory alive for my daughter."
