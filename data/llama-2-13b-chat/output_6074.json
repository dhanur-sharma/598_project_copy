        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was a cold morning, I picked up my manager and we were on the way to work. We were driving towards our building and coming upon an intersection. As I slowed down for the red light, we saw an SUV make a turn and WHAM! Hit a teenage boy who was crossing the road. The boy bounced off the hood of the truck like a ragdoll, flying back into the street. Will and I were both like \"Holy shit dude!\" I turned on my hazards and pulled over, dialing 911 as we jumped out of the car and ran to the boy. The SUV started driving down the street and my mgr. snapped a picture of his license plate, but then it stopped and the man driving jumped out to check on the boy. The boy seemed extremely dazed and was holding his arms in an awkward looking position, we sat him down on the curb. I was freaking out because 911 had me on HOLD of all things, I thought that was something that happened in disaster movies not in real life, not at 7 am on a Monday morning. But as soon as they finally picked up I gave them the cross-streets, and it took less than 2 minutes to hear sirens and see the paramedics coming down the street. We thought the boy was concussed, but then realized he had a clubbed arm and some features of a Down's Syndrome person. Jesus, how messed up, this poor retarded kid was just crossing the street and got hit by a car. And they guy driving, how sucky must that be to not just hit a person but a mentally disabled one? Anyway, paramedics took care of the boy, his father was called and came to the scene quick, he was going to be okay and the sheriff was talking to the dude driving the SUV. I gave my statement and left. Messed up Monday."
