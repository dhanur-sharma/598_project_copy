        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was sexually abused as a child so anything sexual has been attached to shame and guilt. I felt gross whenever I masturbated or touched myself, it felt awful. Then a few days ago, I'm not sure why it happened, but I told myself that my sexuality was mine and that I'm entitled to it, that I should feel ashamed of it. It clicked and it felt like the shame was gone. I felt happy and empowered. I started crying and giggling at the same time, it was like a huge weight was lifted off of my shoulders. I felt really good to finally be able to own something that was mine to begin with. I even felt angry that it was taken from me for so long, but angry in a good way. Angry that I had parts of myself taken away from me to begin with. It was a really confusing set of emotions. It felt really good though. I owned those feelings, they were mine. I finally felt like I was entitled to them. It was like a lid came off of me and everything came pouring out. I've been working through a lot in my past and it feels wonderful to see my progress."
