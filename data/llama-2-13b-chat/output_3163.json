        "Summarize the following story in first person: My cousin called to tell me that my dad was really sick.  My dad and my mom had divorced before I was born and he had never really been in my life my whole 55 years.  I had only got to meet him because his dad had gotten died and he came home to the funeral, so I did not meet him until I was about 12 years old.  When my cousin notified me, I was really apprehensive.  We had talked on and off to each other over the years, mostly on birthdays and holidays.  My husband drove me the over one hundred miles to the hospital.  He was in ICU and just laying there until I spoke.  He then begin to joke around with my husband and I.  Later when I had left, I learned that he had coded and a decision had to made.  My step-sister of whom I had never met informed of this.  I had another sister and two brother by my dad but not my mom who was living but they refused to be involved even though he had raised them.  The next day I received a call from my brother who told me that he had been contacted that my step-mother had already pulled the cord and dad was gone. An obituary was written and emailed to me with misspelled names and listed a sister that I had only heard of but never met.  The person my step-sister set up everything but having a body at the funeral.  My siblings, cousins, dad's brother and I were totally surprise to attend and see a large picture where the body should have been, with no explanation other that it would have cost too much."
