        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last month (July), I decided to throw my boyfriend a surprise birthday party. He was turning 30 (big deal) and when I asked him what he wanted, he kept saying either \"nothing\" or \"just to spend a quiet night at home.\" His low birthday expectations made me feel bad. We are on a serious debt payoff and have a very limited budget, so I know he was just trying to keep me from spending money. But you only turn 30 once! So I texted everyone he knows, from family, to friends, to see if people could come to a surprise birthday party at his favorite bar. This way, everyone pays for their own drinks, and it wouldn't cost us more than the price of a few beers. I found a date that worked for most people, and started planning away! It was fun, and it was also challenging trying to keep him from finding out. I had a few close calls, especially because his mom has a big mouth! The best part of the story is, when his mom heard what I was doing, she offered to fund the whole party! She gave the bartender her credit card, and all of the guests had free food and drinks to last the evening. This took so much stress off me, because it felt like a \"real\" party! He was so surprised and touched that everyone came. People drove in from as far as 2 hours away to see him, and I know he will never forget that birthday. It feels great to make someone else happy, and its an event that both he and I will never forget. He says it was his best birthday ever."
