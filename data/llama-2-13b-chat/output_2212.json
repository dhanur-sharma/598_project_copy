        "Summarize the following story in first person: My husband's family lives in central Mexico. In the capital city of his state, so it's a pretty nice place to visit. Cultural and historical, with great food, and of course, most of his family. He had told our kids he would be taking them to California for vacation this summer, but then his father got sick. His dad, who lives in Mexico, was diagnosed with a type of cancer that is not curable, and expected life span is about 5 years at most. So on very short notice, about 2 days, my husband decided that we would all go to Mexico so he could see his dad and family. I am the one that does the packing for pretty much everyone, myself and 3 kids, and even my husband to an extent. I had to get the dog into a kennel and get everything ready for the trip. We had passports ready, so that was a big worry out of the way. The drive, and we do have to drive because 5 round trip tickets is unbelievably expensive, is anywhere from 16 to 22 hours, depending on how long it takes to cross the border. I always dread crossing because there is usually something we need to process, some paper we forgot, or we are one of the unlucky people who get to have all of our stuff searched. We got to the border without incident, and then I could feel my stomach tighten as we parked the car to go get our visitor permits. Thankfully, that went rather quickly, and we were back into the truck in a short time and ready to go into Mexico. We were very lucky and didn't get stopped for a search. The first border agent we saw didn't even ask for passports, but he is right at the crossing. There was one, i knew, coming up several miles later. Astoundingly, we were not bothered there, either. He checked our passports, not permits, and on we went. Since the crossing took such a minimal amount of time, we arrived in my husband's city in about 16 or 17 hours. It was a quick trip and we got to spend more time with family since there were no delays."

We were lucky to have a GPS and a map app on our phones, and the car had a built in GPS system. The roads were mostly good, but there were some rough spots. I was really surprised at how well the car handled it. We had to drive through some rain and even hail, but we made it to my husband's hometown in one piece. We arrived late in the evening and it was really dark and rainy. We could barely see anything and it was hard to find the way to his parents' house. But we made it and it was great to see his family and meet some of his friends. We were able to spend a week with them, which was a great experience for the kids and me. We got to see a lot of the local sights and try a lot of the local foods. I was really happy that we were able to make the trip and that everything went so smoothly. We were lucky to have such a great car and to have such great weather for"
