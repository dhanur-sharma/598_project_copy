        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was holding on to my pee and drinking more cups of water than i needed.  I was holding on to my urine a lot for four weeks because i was didn't want to let go of the online games i was playing. After, a few weeks. I noticed that i couldn't control my bladder and the frequency of going to the bathroom was increasing. I was scared for my life. If i didn't go the bathroom once my body called for, my urinary tract would start hurting. I never had pain like this in my urinary tract before. I couldn't/can't do the normal things i once did. Like go on a run for 30 minutes because i would be wanting to urgently go the bathroom in between my run. I went to the my annual physical doctor and she didn't know what kind of treatment i needed. She referred me to someone else. Like passing the baton on to someone else. Anyways, I thought my frequency to go to the bathroom would go away with eating fruits and vegetables, but it didn't. So i have an appointment lined up next week with a urinary specialist. Hopefully he/she will cure me."
