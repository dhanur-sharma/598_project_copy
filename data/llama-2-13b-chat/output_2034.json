        "Summarize the following story in first person: So I went to Busch gardens a few weeks ago in Tampa Bay. I mainly wanted to see the animals at the zoo. I got to see all types of animals such as crocodiles as well as cheetahs. I went on the cheetah run ride which was really fun. I also went on a bunch of roller coasters which were fun as well. But the main thing I wanted to do was go on the safari! On the safari you get an up close look at rhinos as well as ostriches and zebras and giraffes! And on top of that you get to feed the giraffes! We went out on a jeep and the giraffes all came over! They very huge and very hungry. We had lettuce and we got to feed the giraffes and just hang out with them for awhile it was great! It was the highlight of the trip for sure! After that I got some pizza at the restaurant over looking the safari. I relaxed a bit by the pool before heading home. It was a great day!"
