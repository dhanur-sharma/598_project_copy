        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was a sunny afternoon and I was driving home from just closing on my new house. It was the end of March so the weather was nice and the temperature was perfect. I was in a great mood as I was cruising down the expressway with my windows down and my favorite music playing. I was nearing the exit for my home when I was merging into traffic and felt a bump on the rear of my car as I collided with another car. It was barely a tap on my vehicle but I pulled over with the other vehicle to assess the situation. I recall the passenger and the driver both being loud and irate but the driver was a little more calm. I checked out my car and didn't have any damage at all but the front of the other car had some scrapes and damage. They called the cops and ultimately I was cited because I was the vehicle merging into traffic although they technically hit me from the rear. I wasn't happy about the situation but I didn't make a big deal about it at the time. I was still excited about closing on my new house but the joy was fading as I thought more about the situation. I went about my day after exchanging information and getting my ticket but it didn't sit with me well when I thought about it more. I truly think that I was involved in a type of insurance scam.  I feel I had plenty of space to merge, but the other car increased speed and hit me. I think they knew that I would be at fault because I was merging even if it was them that hit me. My other suspicion is that they work for a car body and paint shop and could easily fix their car but put a higher cost on when reporting it to the insurance company. Lastly, everything was fine that day but later I found out that the both the passenger and driver are claiming an injury to further increase their insurance claim. What was supposed to be a joyous occasion for me has been plagued with this pathetic attempt at an insurance scam."
