        "Summarize the following story in first person: A couple of months ago it was my niece's birthday. She was turning four and had a small get together of family and friends at her parent's place. The party started out with her doing a dance. Then we went outside to eat some pizza and play. After the pizza, she wanted to play with some barbies. I decided to play with her so we went upstairs to her room to get the barbies. It took us a few minutes to decided how many to get. Her little brother also joined us. All together we probably had eight or nine barbies and a large bus for the barbies. Unfortunately, by the time we had retrieved all the barbies it was time for cake and for a six year old, cake trumps. We sang her happy birthday and lit the cake. Then she proceeded to try and blow out the candles for the next three to four minutes to no avail. It turns out her parent's had put trick candles on the cake and we all had a good laugh about it. After the cake we put some music on and danced a bit more. Finally everybody started to say their goodbyes and we all left the birthday with a few new toys and a belly full of cake."
