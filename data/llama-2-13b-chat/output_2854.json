        "Summarize the following story in first person: So about one month ago, I was told by a colleague at work about a pet adoption drive they were having at a local center in which they volunteered at. They told me that i should really think about adopting a animal because they felt it would be something that could bring a bit of happiness to my life. At first when they told me about it, I was a little bit hesitant to accept it but they said that I should at least come take a look and that they wouldn't pressure me about going through it. I agreed and went to the center on Saturday.  When I got there I was a a little nervous but excited at the same time. I took a look around and immediately noticed a little pup that caught my eye. I went over to where she was and asked the person who was assisting people with their questions about the little dog in front of me. She told me all about the puppy, the breed, gender and other bits of information and asked me if i was interested in taking her. I immediately said yes and was shone where to go to get everything prepared. I took care of all the necessary stuff and finally was able to my new little pouch home. I decided to name her maul because something about her personality just brought this name to me.  Well, it took very little time to hit it off and just after a month we've become inseparable. She's like my second shadow and is always there to meet me whenever I get home. It's been such a pleasant surprise to have her around, she truly has brought lots of joy and excitement into my life. It's to see how I've gotten along in life for so long without having such a nice little companion at my side. My world certainly has become a lot brighter with her around. I feel like I finally understand the joy that dog lovers experience from having these little guys in their life."
