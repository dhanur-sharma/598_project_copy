        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was excited and nervous when I went to my graduation ceremony for getting my masters degree last week. All that work finally paid off and I was ready to take the next step in my life. I was worried about how I looked and knew at some point everyone would be looking at me. I bought new shoes since that's the only thing that shows under my graduation robe. They were nice plain black shoes and I got a good deal on them. Lucky for me they were also comfortable, because we stood around for nearly two hours before the ceremony began. The longer it took, the more nervous I got. I wish we could just get it over with. When my diploma was finally in my hands I was so proud of myself I could barely stand still. My family was very supportive, but I had no idea they were going to throw me a party. It was the best party ever since my grandmother and my Aunt Lois were there. I haven't seen Aunt Lois for a couple years and she's always been my favorite aunt. She remembered roasted chicken was my favorite and insisted that's what we had for dinner. What a nice surprise! Mom really did a lot of work but I could tell she was having a lot of fun. She's proud of me and that makes me feel really good. This was the best party I've ever been to, and it was all for me. Having my family support me and celebrate my success is going to be something I carry with me my whole life."
