        "Summarize the following story in first person: February 14th was not just valentines day, it was a very special day. It was the day that I gave my significant other a promise ring. She always believed in promise rings coming before an engagement ring, and I wanted to give that to her. I decided to do it at a very special location as well. There is a lighthouse on lake Hefner. It was her mothers favorite location. Her mother is now deceased. I wanted to make a connection to her mother with this event. It was kind of like requesting her mothers approval. All in all she absolutely loved the ring. I made sure to make it rather expensive for a promise ring. We finished off the night by eating at one of her favorite restaurants. It was a very special night and moment in my lifetime. I will never forget it. I don't think she will either. Now she has one more special memory for that specific location. I also hope her mother was watching from above and approved of me."
