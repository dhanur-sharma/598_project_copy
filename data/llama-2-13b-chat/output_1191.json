        "Summarize the following story in first person: Two months ago we planned a trip to Myrtle Beach as a family. Though the plan was executed two months back, the plan was nearly under consideration for six months. Because if a person has time another does not have. So it was a hectic process to make everyone available. The time came two months ago. Finally we packed everything and went to the trip. My uncle and aunt also joined the trip. It was really amusing until that incident occurred. Everyone were enjoying in the beach. My father in law suddenly held his chest and fell down. Everyone was shocked for a second. After coming out from shock we shouted for help. Immediately everyone gathered around and asked about the problem. Fortunately a doctor was present in the crowd. He came and checked my father in law and gave first aid. Soon my father in law came to conscious and we took him to the nearby hospital for further checkup."

But my father in law was calm and told us that he will be alright. We took him to the hospital and he underwent angioplasty. He is now recovering in the hospital. This incident occurred on the third day of our trip. Now we are worried about how to continue our trip. We all are worried about my father in law's health. We are also worried about the cost of the treatment. But my father in law is positive and he told us that he will be alright soon. So we are hoping for the best and continuing our trip as planned."
