This year our summer was the usual yearly plan, vacation down in key west. The same little bungalow we always stayed at. The same restaurants we usually visited, the same activities we always did, snorkeling, adventuring. But something was different this year. This year, my daughter now a full blown teenager, wanted nothing to do with us. She was not mean,vindictive or anything else. She just was not my little girl anymore, she was growing into a mature adult. She had her own plans, that did not really involve us anymore. As soon as we arrived, she had an old friend she wanted to meet up with. That was fine, we could manage without her. But, as it turned out we would only see her a tiny fraction of our summer. We knew who she was with, and that she was safe, but, we would very rarely get a chance to interact with her, except through text. I hate texts."

My wife and I, have always been the ones to plan our vacations, make reservations, pick out the restaurants, and all that jazz. But this year, my daughter took charge of all that. She planned the whole trip. I had to get used to the fact that I was no longer in control. She also brought her own laptop, so she could text her friends and do her own thing. We were not allowed to use her laptop, it was her domain. This was a new experience for me. I was not used to being told I could not use something. I had to learn to adapt, and fast. The first week was a disaster. We were fighting over everything. I was trying to get used to the fact that I was no longer the one in control, but my wife was not having it. She was still trying to be the one in charge, but my daughter was having none of it. It was a constant power struggle. I was getting frustrated, my wife was getting frustrated, and my daughter was getting frustrated. But then something happened. My daughter had"
