        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was sitting with my friend at a restaurant we usually go to. It's a casual sit down place so there are a variety of families cultures and people that visit. We went about 2 weeks ago to celebrate a promotion I had just gotten at work. I was really enjoying myself and thought my friend was too. He had been drinking some, but nothing excessive or out of the ordinary for him.  Our waiter was Hispanic and was super attentive and friendly.  We had been at the restaurant for around an hour, and I told my friend I needed to get going because I had an early day at work the next day. My friend said the bill was on him and he looked around for our waiter. We got the guys attention and he came over to us.  My friend though he should have been over to us sooner, I guess, because he said something about the guy having swum the river to get to the us faster than he got us our bill.  I think my jaw must have hit the table. I was completely shocked and couldn't believe such nasty words had come out of my friends mouth.  The waiter just left the bill and walked off. I was so embarrassed. My husband is Mexican and I had no idea my friend had just racist thoughts.  I paid the bill instead and left the waiter a huge tip.  I know that cant make up for such racism but I felt I had to do something.  I walked out with my friend and I could feel my face still flaming from anger and embarrassment mental at his words. I told him before I left the parking lot that what he had said was uncalled for and racist. He looked at me like I was in the wrong. We havent spoken since."
