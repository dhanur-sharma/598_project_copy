Jobs and stuff. Can't blame them though. However, we do try and find time to be together. We got back together last month, around four weeks ago. It was a small family reunion in Bellevue, Washington. Uncle John has a small place there. Mary came, so did Liam and others. It felt like old times. We went on a trip of wine tasting there. It was really fun. It was especially surprising to see Mary enjoy it, as she was never a wine person. We all had such great fun. Hoping to do it soon again."
