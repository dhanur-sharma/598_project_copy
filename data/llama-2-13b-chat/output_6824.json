        "Summarize the following story in first person: Within the last days I celebrated my three year anniversary with my girlfriend. It was 3 years on June 14th so we drove up into Cherokee, North Carolina from Georgia in order to go camping. We left in the morning and first went to the shops went we got into Cherokee and we got awesome new moccasin shoes that were fuzzy on the inside for our lazy few day trip. We drove into the campground after we ate a burger in town for dinner. Pitching the tent was really fun, because my two dogs were attacking the poles as we were trying to set it up; my girlfriend was laughing and smiling cheek to cheek. We got the tent pitched and decided to get the fire started before we brought our supplies into the tent, so I went up to the main office to buy some kindle and firewood. I built a massive fire with the help of my girlfriend and she took all the credit to herself as per usual. She's always proud of herself for funny things like that. We brought a plastic chest full of snacks and supplies so we would definitely not go hungry. Usually couples go out to dinner and date, but we ate out of cans for 3 days! I think this is definitely a main reason why I lover her. We don't have to be like every other couple. We're unique. When we were done there; we didn't want to leave. Neither did the dogs! We watched all of our movies we had downloaded on our computers and drained our powerbank so we couldn't charge our phones, so being a 21st century couple, we went back to civilization! I had a blast and I know we will never forget our awesome time."
