        "Summarize the following story in first person: My birthday was a complete opposite of the week before it. Two weeks ago, my father died. The man I had known my entire life, looked up to my entire life, just no longer existed. Something that I had always known was there, suddenly was not. It was difficult to deal with, as most death is, but his spirit and the memories I have of him will never disappear. And I learned this a week later, when things finally came to it's normalcy. I had spent the entire day hanging out in the yard and the hills and decided to go up that evening and dig up some of my childhood toys for the kids and there it was, the pistol my dad bought me when I was a kid. It was a piece of crap, of course; rusted and dusted. A children's toy meant to shoot wooden pellets, something I'm sure the political correctness of this generation would frown on. I brought the gun down from the attic and told my son to come over and bring his friends and I taught them out to use it. They had watched us old fogeys shoot on the range for the better portion of the day, I suppose their turn was coming. The moldy box of pellets still had a few usable pieces of ammunition and I drew a bulls-eye on the side of the house and let them play target practice. A couple of times, I had to warn the kids of the safety of pointing it in each other's face but watching them play with a potentially dangerous yet fun piece of my childhood brought those tears and memories right back to me. The times we had were well spent. The times I'm having with my kid and someone else's kids are also well spent. So, this was when I realized that this is how things are supposed to be. Farewell, Dad."
