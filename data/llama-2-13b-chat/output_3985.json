        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was January,  2009, I experienced a traumatic experience on my very close friends wedding. My mother was driving my friend, me, and my brothers back home because the wedding was over. My youngest brother, my friend, and I, were in the backseat and my eldest brother was in the passenger seat. Every one was tips and we all lost controls in so many things at the wedding before we left but my mum insisted we leave because she had to o to work early the next dayAll of a sudden, the world went black. I opened my eyes moments later only to see my mother crying helplessly and weakly for help. I looked to my left, where my friend was, she was calling for her mother, saying \u201cI want my mom, where is my mom?\u201d and complaining that her shoulder hurt. I then looked to my right, and saw my little brother crying, and breathing harshly. My eldest brother, surprisingly was fine. He asked me if I was alright, and I responded by saying, my head hurts. My brother suddenly looked at the side of my face, and said \u201cJade put your gloves on your face.\u201dI saw strange faces telling us to be calm and was helping us out of the car, When we were fully out of the car, my mom was still trapped inside. Her door had been caved in and she was unable to move. I shed a tear, then quickly ran and looked for help so i could reach 911 and luckily I got and the quickly arrived. I watched as the ambulance rushed her away, began to cry, and then realized that my little brother was standing right next to me. He was not breathing well and his face was beat red. My little brother is an asthmatic, so I immediately alerted a medic. We all followed them to the  hospital where we were each assigned a room, my friend and I were in a room together, and my brothers were each in their own rooms. At thatat point  I realized that you don\u2019t know how much you love someone, until they are fighting for their life just so they can live to see your face everyday. My mom is my idol. She has fought for her life in order to stay in mine and my siblings\u2019. She has dumped guys she really liked, because she knows that when things are real bad, we are the ones that help her get through it the most. She has even gone days without eating so that we could eat. I look to my mom for everything, and am hoping she will be around for a long time. Death, can sweep you away in an instant. Some people just let it happen, but others are just too stubborn to give up."
