        "Summarize the following story in first person: I am being harassed at work by this man who thinks he can say horrible things, and look at me inappropriately with his dirty eyes. One time he even came up to me and groped me from behind. That was the last straw and I had to report his behavior. However my boss did not believe me, and instead after my report he told everyone how one should not tell baseless lies while looking straight at me. I have never felt so angry and embarrassed before in my life. After that happened, everyone is talking behind my back, about how I'm that person. I felt horrible. It was wrong. And I didn't like it. I don't know why it's happening to me, and I just want to shrink into the floor. I don't know how to get away so I just thought about what I could do to fix this mess. But nothing came to mind. I felt like I didn't belong. In the end, I decided that I had to forge on. No matter what. I can't just give up."
