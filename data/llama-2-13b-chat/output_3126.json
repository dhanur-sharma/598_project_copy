        "Summarize the following story in first person: Since we had our first kid 2 years ago life has been very busy. I'm a stay at home mom. My husband works a lot to provide for our family and we haven't been able to go on vacation until a couple of months ago. We decided to go to the beach because our toddler have never seen the ocean and we used to go to the beach every year before we had our son. We went in May and the water was super cold still but we had so much fun running away from the waves and playing in sand. Our son was so mesmerized by the ocean. He kept calling it Big Water. The waves were pretty big the first day. One time he felt brave enough to run into the water without holding my hand and when he saw a big wave coming his way he didn't have enough time running away from it and it got him! He didn't cry but he kept telling us: \"Big water got me!\" It was so funny. Oh, We even saw some dolphins! It was quite special. We also spent a day with our friends who recently moved to Virginia beach. We went to this very small family owned restaurant together and it was truly a hidden gem! It doesn't look good from the outside but when you're inside you can feel this nice, friendly vibe. The food was also so delicious and they have THE BEST home made brownies I've ever had in my life! It was our very first vacation as a family of three and i will always remember it with a smile."
