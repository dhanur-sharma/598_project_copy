        "Summarize the following story in first person: Recently, I was on the cusp of completing my BS in Elementary Education. I had completed all coursework and only had my student teaching internship to complete. For my internship, I was required to act as a full time teacher without pay for 12 weeks, meaning that I would be out of work and without a paycheck for three months. I had prepared for this in advance, but once my internship actually started, emergencies started happening left and right, and before I knew it, every penny I had set aside had been used up. I vividly remember having moments when something would happen, or my wife would make me aware of a situation that I would look up and say, \"Really? This has to happen now?\" I remember feeling that things were happening to purposely cause me to not finish my degree. Almost like divine intervention, and I couldn't understand why. About halfway into the internship, I found myself out of money and behind on bills. If I had stayed the course for the last 6 weeks, I would have finished my degree but I would been evicted and possibly had my car repossessed. I have a wife and kids, and with that, I had to make a very important decision. It was one of the hardest decisions I had to make, and I went back and forth on it quite a bit. I decided to quit the internship and get back to work. My wife urged me to stay with it, but, being the one who does our family budget, I knew there was simply no way to continue, short of a miracle. As a result, I was forced to change my degree program and lost a year's worth of credits. It was one of the hardest failures I've ever had to endure."
