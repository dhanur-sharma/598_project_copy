        "Summarize the following story in first person: It has been a few months now and I am not feeling any better.  Everyone says it takes time, but I see no end to feeling this way.  I miss my grandfather so much I can't breath.  I feel like there is a truck sitting on my chest.  I want to get out of bed and live my life to the fullest, but it feels like it takes all of my energy just to get in the shower.  Maybe if I talk to someone it will help to get me out of this depression, but that feels so hard too.  I know my grandfather would not be happy with me just laying in bed sad all day, he would want me out living life.  It is too short we don't ever know how much time we have left on this Earth.  Sometimes I just sit and think about how everything could be over in the blink of an eye.  When I am feeling my worst I sometimes wish it would end.  Then in the next minute I can't believe that ran through my head.  I have so many dreams that I want to fulfill I know that I need help.  Maybe if I pull myself up and go for a walk I will feel better.  You never know what a new day may hold.  I'm going to try my best to take it one day at a time.  Each day I will do one extra thing to help me heal and feel better."
