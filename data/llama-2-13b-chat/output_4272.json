        "Summarize the following story in first person: Our son is now almost six months old now. Our daughter had problems using the potty. She finally on her own broke her fears and now uses the potty. We even got a call about our sons birth . We are owed money! How cool things are going great! School for our daughter was rocky in the beginning and now she is doing great! It\u2019s awesome to watch them both grow. It\u2019s great to see them hit milestones in their lives. Things are going well and hope the next six months will be even better! However not too fast as I we want to enjoy our children as much as we can. It\u2019s been a joy to have the little one added to our family.  It still hits me when I come home and see my family.  It\u2019s been an extra challenge, but we are up for it all. It\u2019s well worth it . Seeing our family happy is a joy. It sure is every day!"
