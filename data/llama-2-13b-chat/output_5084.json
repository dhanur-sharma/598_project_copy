        "Summarize the following story in first person: My friend and I were invited to a party by my boss' wife. It was his birthday surprise party. My friend and I thought, whatever, it may be fun, so we went. We arrived and started mingling with a few friends and the boss' wife. Our boss came in, and was greatly surprised, but somewhat distant from the party. A few hours passed, and my friend and I were close to leaving. All of sudden, our boss runs down the stairs, yelling for someone to call the police. We got so worried and scared, and everyone started mumbling about what could possibly be going on. We over heard people talking about several things, but eventually found out that someone had stolen important documents from our boss' office. This scared us, because who could do that? Our boss was a great person, very caring and empathetic, and we would never dream of something like that happening at his party. The police came and everyone was questioned. We eventually were allowed to go home, but it stuck with us for sometime. Even work seemed different. And they never caught the person who stole the documents. I often wonder if it's someone I sit next to at work."
