        "Summarize the following story in first person: It's been so long since I've written in here!  So much has been going on in my life.  Things have been pretty stressful which is why I'm so glad made an addition to our family!  About 6 months ago we adopted Azul.  Azul is our amazing Blue-headed macaw.  He is so much fun.  He was just a baby when we adopted him from Angelina Jolie!  I still can't believe we got to meet her.  She was volunteering at the local animal shelter and we happened to be there at the same time.  That just makes Azul so much more special to us.  So Azul has been flying everywhere and getting very confident in his abilities.  We've been working on training him to do certain tricks.  Just within the past week we were able to get him to step onto our hand!  It's so cute to see him walk so gently right into the palm of my hand.  I am so in love with him.  He was the best addition we've made in a long time and he is such a stress reliever!"
