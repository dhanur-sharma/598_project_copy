        "Summarize the following story in first person: dear diary, this is a very a sad day my dog Zeus has tragically passed away. we did not know the specific illness that he had, but the symptoms were awful. he was a very old dog and his immune system had all of a sudden stopped functioning properly. His legs were getting very weak and he could no longer stand properly. We would have to give him his pain medication 3 times a times a day. Even then he would sometimes howl in pain periodically. My brother who had also grow up with Zeus suggested that it might be time to put the dog down. My-self and most of my immediate family were ready not to put him down so we decided to wait. this was a mistake, as the poor dog's condition worsened day by day. eventually it got to the point where the medication did not help ew had to come to a decision as a family. This was very emotionally taxing so we went to the vet to get a consult on the best possible action. We decided on this day june 20, 2019 that it was time for Zeus to be released. Released from was pain. Released from suffering. Released from the mortal plane. We did not have any type of special funeral just the family who knew him best and some blessings from the lord."
