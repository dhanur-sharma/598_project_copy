        "Summarize the following story in first person: Today is my birthday, May 4th.  I have decided to through a birthday party for myself and my kids today.  They're birthdays are close to mine, so I figured we could all share the party this year, since no one was celebrating a milestone birthday.  I rented a lodge, and prepared decorations in the theme of Twin Peaks, as it's an important show in our family.  My children who are now 4 and 6 even request to listen to songs from the soundtrack during car rides.  I pride myself on throwing them very unique parties that other children would not have.  I bought doughnuts from the best place in town and and spent an entire day actually decorating the lodge.  I spent a month planning the proper decor and spent plenty of money on them.  All of this effort and at the last minute, my in-laws, who where half the guest list started calling that morning and giving reasons as to why they can't come.  All of them boiled down to that they just didn't feel like driving to our town.  My husband and I live an hour and a half from our home town.  I was so upset.  Here I was putting in all this effort into something that half the people on the list, who were family, couldn't even be bother to show up.  We made the best of it, our few friends in town came, and my parents and brother.  All in all it was a good little party and the kids never knew any different.  However, I was furious, and brokenhearted that family could so easily brush them off.  Anytime cousins on that side of the family have parties we are expected to haul our children over for the hour and a half drive, and I never even thought twice about it.  It was important to be with family.  Now I see where we stand and will not be putting myself out for people who have now repeatedly shown me we're not worth one trip, once a year."
