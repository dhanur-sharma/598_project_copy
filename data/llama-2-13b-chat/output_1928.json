        "Summarize the following story in first person: Dear Diary, I finally have time to write something down. I've been dealing with a lot lately. The other day my wife had a back spasm. I wasn't home at the time but she had went to the emergency room. Helping her with her recovery is rather challenging. It's going to be weeks until shes okay again. She cant walk. I just cant stand the amount of pain shes in right now. We had to spend all of our savings. Luckily because of our daughter at home I'm still able to go to work. If it wasn't for her I'd have to stay home to help my wife with daily activities.  My daughter has been helping out so much I hope her grades don't suffer because of it. We have no choice because otherwise we wont be able to eat. I'm glad my wife is doing better than the day she had the spasm. It was hard to watch while i was in the room with her."
