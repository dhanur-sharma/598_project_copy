        "Summarize the following story in first person: My husband and I have been married over 24 years, but have had bumps along the way. We decided to take a family trip not too long ago. But, we felt this was a good time for us to reconnect. Our children are older, so we could leave them in the condo rental unsupervised, if we wanted some alone time. During the day, we took some days to go to the beach. My husband and I would stay together. We would sit and talk on the beach, just getting closer in the beautiful surroundings. Our children would spend a large amount of time in the ocean, or some in the condo when they would get tired during the day beach activity. At night, my husband and I would walk along the beautiful beach. The moonlight would glow on the sand, while we would hold hands and walk along the shore. It helped us have some romantic time we needed, and a way to try to reconnect. After our walks, we would go sit on the quiet and breezy beach in the beach chairs. We would chat, and almost just seemed it was just us alone there. We also took this time to become closer as a family. We would go do family activities on the days that we didn't go to the beach for the day, or in the afternoons. We had bowled one day, and played games at the arcade. This made my husband and I feel a bit more youthful and carefree. This was good for our overall emotional and mental health, but also feel a bit closer. We really enjoyed all the time we spent together. We would hit the hot tub at night after our walks along the beach, cuddling and just enjoying each other. It was a truly memorable and fantastic time for us, as a family, and as a couple. Time we really needed, in many ways."
