        "Summarize the following story in first person: I bought my first house earlier this year, toward the end of April, which was about 4 months ago. It was absolutely the most exciting and stressful event of my life. I had spent years preparing for this--building my credit score up, saving money, researching loan types, finding a good mortgage broker, and so on. Once I finally felt ready, the search for the right house took more than a year. The market in my area was very hot, so I lost out on several potential houses because the sellers chose to accept another offer. I did not even make an offer on most of the houses I saw. The hot market had caused a lot of \"flipped\" properties to hit the market as sellers hastened to take advantage of high prices--and many of those had obviously poor quality renovation work, some of which was in violation of local regulations. Some homes had not had any work done at all and were in extremely poor condition for the price, requiring extensive and expensive repairs just to become habitable. It did not help that I was trying to buy a home at a lower price range. Finally, however, I was lucky. The sellers of the house I ended up buying had originally accepted another offer instead of mine. The buyer they chose backed out at the closing table. Another buyer was selected, but they were unable to follow through with their offer due to financing issues. I was the third choice, but my offer was solid and we closed on schedule--April 26th, which happens to be my birthday. At long last, I had finally bought my very first house. I was so proud and excited, but I was also mentally exhausted from the years of preparation and searching. Even more work was yet to come. The house I bought was habitable, but I wanted to do some work on the inside prior to moving in: cleaning, patching, painting. I did most of this work personally, with the help of my partner and father, while also working full-time and attending college part-time. After about a month of work, we finally moved in all of our belongings. I am not sure how I managed to accomplish all of this, but somehow I did. I appreciate the support of my partner and my family. I still think about this event daily, with pride and a lingering touch of disbelief. It is still sometimes hard for me to believe that I finally own my own house!"
