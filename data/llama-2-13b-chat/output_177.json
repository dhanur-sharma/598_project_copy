        "Summarize the following story in first person: Things were a little different this year, Diary. 5 weeks ago was mom's birthday and this time we wanted to do something special. Sis and I have plenty of fond memories of our birthdays growing up over the years, but now that we're older we realized that it had always been about us; we didn't have any memories in particular about celebrating our mom's birthdays by doing anything special. We had a hard time even remembering how old she was! Can you imagine that? We took it upon ourselves to make her know that we did appreciate her this time around. We went out and got ingredients, inspired and determined to make a cake for her with our own hands. We don't bake much, but we found a recipe that looked pretty good and got started on it. I'm not going to say it was the hardest thing in the world, but the labor was satisfying in a way. It made is reflect on the effort that mom must have put in for our birthdays, as we've always had homemade cake. In the end, we managed to bring it together. It wasn't a surprise party or anything like that. We told her that we wanted to celebrate with her at home and have a little party to ourselves. She sounded happy on the phone, but I didn't realize just what it would mean to her. The party was simple; just the 3 of us. We had each gotten her little gifts; knick nacks. I got her a new light for her bike (her last one had been stolen) and sis got her a new scarf. We opened the presents first and enjoyed the day a little bit before we brought in our homemade cake to surprise her. You should have seen the light shining in her eyes! They were glistening with the sun as tears began to well up. \"I've never had a cake before!\" she said. Talked about how she hadn't even stopped to think about her birthdays while we were growing up. She was always working hard doing her best to make us feel safe and taken care of. Well, my sister and I started crying too. We all held each other together and wept with joy that we could share this together."

We'd been so caught up in our own lives and growing up that we never stopped to think about what she'd been doing for us. I know it's not the best cake in the world, but it was made with love and thoughtfulness. I know that this is something we'll always remember. I'm glad that we could make her feel loved and appreciated. I know that we'll do it again next year."
