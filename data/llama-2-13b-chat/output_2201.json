        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 3 weeks ago I experienced a drive by shooting. I was at a neighbors home we're we were just talking about things having a normal conversation. things started to get crazy in the area thought. It involved a drive by shooting. It was terrifying I didn't know what to do at the time. All I knew to think of was my kids because they were outside at the time. There were other kids outside playing as well. It was just a scary situation with everyone who could have potentially gotten hurt. There were three people who ended up getting shot. It also happened out side where the kids were playing in a field. Luckily no kids had gotten hurt during the shooting. So I was happy to find my children unscatthed. It seemed the shooters were targeting adults in the field where we all were. There was few that did get shot but we made it out clean. I am very grateful to have been able to get through with no issues. I know my friends weren't hurt as well. Overall it was a crazy situation to experience."
