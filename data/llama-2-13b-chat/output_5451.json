        "Summarize the following story in first person: Five months ago my life was changed forever. It was early in the morning when i left for work, slightly later than i usually do, i noticed. I was having my morning coffee on the way to work, normally i would relax and enjoy my coffee while reading the morning paper but based on the circumstances, this seemed more appropriate. I managed to get to the work site only 2 minutes late. I guess to me its only 2 minutes, but to my boss it might as well have been 2 hours. After being scolded like a child who has done something wrong, i got to work. My job was roofing. Yup, a construction worker. My job was never a bad one, and i still don't think it is. After climbing the ladder to get to the beams i would be standing on, roughly 15 feet from the ground, i fastened my work belt to make sure my tools would not fall off. Everything was going as usual, other than it being unbearably hot at 10 AM. When its hot like that, roofers get the worst of it. Maybe that's what played a part, the heat restraining me from thinking logically. To this day though, i believe it was just dumb luck. I was almost finished roofing the section i needed to for the day, putting me way ahead of my schedule so i decided to take a break. As i got up from my position (I was sitting directly on a beam with my legs hanging off the edge) the beam i was standing on made a noise, then within seconds, i was falling through the air. That's all i could remember from that point. I woke up in the hospital seeing my wife and 2 kids by the sides of my bed. Apparently i suffered a head injury which explains the blackout/memory loss. I thought i got lucky and was ready to be more cautious in the future, however, when the doctor came into the room he had more news for me. I suffered a traumatic spinal cord injury. Although i could walk and function like normal, i would have extreme back pain for the rest of my life and my legs will never be as strong as they were. Despite my injury, i took a month to rest and returned to work. I think about that day everyday, and wonder, how much different would my life be right now if i just sat on a different beam."
