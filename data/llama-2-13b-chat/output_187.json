        "Summarize the following story in first person: Over the summer, my fiance's mother wanted to come visit us. We had plans to attend a cheese festival an hour away and invited her. She met us there at the beginning of the festival. It was so hot and some of the cheeses were melting. The festival was much busier than in previous years and some of the cheeses were selling out before we got to try them. A lot of vendors were not prepared for the volume of attendants this year. Additionally, there was nowhere to park. The town was not really ready for all the people that traveled for the festival. We had to park very far away after driving around for a while. Despite the issues, we ended up having a lot of fun. I felt like it was a good bonding experience and really brought me and my fiance's mother closer together. After the event, we went to meet up with my parents. My mother and his mother got to spend a lot of quality time together. We bought cheeses to bring home for my parents to try also. We talked about which ones were our favorites. This even often comes up and is talked about when we see each other."
