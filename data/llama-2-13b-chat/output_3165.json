        "Summarize the following story in first person: Today was a big step forward for me. Two months ago is the day I found out my girlfriend had been cheating on me. Two months ago is when my heart was ripped from my chest. And today is the day that I can finally say that I think I have moved on and am over it. I woke up this morning feeling great. I was smiling and I realized I hadn't done that in a very long time, not since Ashley cheated on me with my best friend. I remember being so happy that day and looking forward to the party so much. My best friend was having his birthday party. It was nothing big, just a bunch of us got together in his basement. We were eating snacks and watching movies. Some people were drinking beers, it was quiet and everyone was having fun. I went outside for a minute to smoke a cigarette and when I came back inside I couldn't find Ashley. I remember everyone was looking at me kind of funny, but I didn't think anything of it. Then I went looking for her and I found her in the kitchen upstairs. She was sitting on the counter top with her legs wrapped around my best friend, they were kissing. I don't know if she was drunk, it really doesn't matter. I don't know if he was drunk, I never gave him the chance to explain himself honestly. In the two months since that day I have done nothing but think about that moment and seethe with anger and disgust. The ultimate betrayal, and from my best friend! That is why waking up this morning with a smile on my face feels like such a big accomplishment. I didn't think I would ever really get to a place where I was happy again, and here I am. I can't wait to leave all this dramatic nonsense behind me."
