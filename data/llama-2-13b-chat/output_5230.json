        "Summarize the following story in first person: Four months ago, my boyfriend and I were spending time exploring Costa Rica. It was our first time traveling internationally. Costa Rica was such an amazing place to choose for travel as the scenery is beautiful. There's one evening that really sticks out to me when I reminisce about our time together. To start, we left our hotel to go explore the great outdoors. We decided to trek out on an evening hike to get a wonderful view of the sunset. The weather was warm with clear skies. Everything seemed perfect. There was a path that led up a mountain side, where we thought we could find the best view. Unfortunately, when we had nearly reached the top, our view was blocked by greenery. That's when something extraordinary happened. Suddenly, we were greeted by a pack of local dogs. While a bit frightened at first, I was quickly calmed by their serene and welcoming presence. It seemed like they wanted us to follow them. Although a bit hesitant, we decided that we should be open to this experience as it was a new adventure to enjoy. After trekking onwards, we could see this beautiful path that aligned perfectly with the setting sun. Surrounded by the person I love, with local dogs, watching a spectacular sunset was the icing to a perfect vacation. I'll never forget that moment."
