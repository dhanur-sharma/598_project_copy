        "Summarize the following story in first person: I had had a verbal agreement with a local favorite restaurant - I would bring our celebrity guests from our Comic Con to their place on Saturday night and they would 'take care of us'. It's on me to have clarified what exactly that meant. And I didn't. The night of, I had planned to put everyone in Ubers to get them to the restaurant. It's worked before and was no problem. I get the first round of people in Ubers and start to call for another, when one of the agent representatives that accompanied two of our guests said, \"We should just take the hotel shuttle. It's free.\" Now, I knew that I shouldn't have agreed. My gut told me that it was easier and more direct to take an Uber and there were hotel guests being dropped off at a concert across town and that would impact us. But I agreed. Like an idiot. The ride took almost an hour, when, had we taken an Uber, it would have been 10 minutes. Half of the guests were waiting at the restaurant for us. People were hungry, I was cranky and panicking. This was going badly. Service at the restaurant, once we arrived, was not great. Food came out in weird waves, drinks were left unfilled. It was not a great look. Worse, still, was the presentation of the check. To me. She had taken about $50 off a $350 bill. The celebrities kicked in money, which was not the plan, and I picked up the rest. It was awkward and weird and unpleasant in a way that made the rest of the night just 'off.' I didn't go back there for months."

I ordered a drink and the first thing out of his mouth was \"I'm so sorry about that night. I don't know what happened.\" I told him that it was water under the bridge, but that I had never gone back because of it. He told me that he had changed the management and staff since then and that they had been working hard to improve. I went back a few more times, and it was good. I even brought my family there for brunch. And then I heard from the agent that represented the celebrities that night that they had been talking and that the restaurant had offered them a large sum of money to not say anything about that night. They had refused, but they wanted me to know. I was pissed. I went back to the restaurant and talked to the owner. I told him that I appreciated his apology and his efforts to improve, but that I couldn't support a place that would try to buy off negative reviews. I haven't been back since"
