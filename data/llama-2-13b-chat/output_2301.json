        "Summarize the following story in first person: For as long as I can remember, I have been a very big fan of the New Kids on the Block. On my birthday this year, my husband bought me tickets for the two of us to go see them in concert. To top it all off, he bought us front row seats! My excitement was overflowing and I could not wait until the concert date.  My husband did not think he would have a very good time seeing an old boy band, but he was wrong. The day finally came for the concert and we made the hour long drive into the city. The whole way there I blasted NKOTB songs through our car stereo. When we got to the venue I could barely contain myself, I cried tears of joy as we parked. This was it! We made our way in and the energy was so uplifting throughout the concourses in the venue. First stop, a concert tshirt. My husband was still trying to act like cool, like he was just tolerating this for my enjoyment. We entered the arena and were ushered all the way to the front to our seats. I couldn't help but turn around in circles looking at how big this place was. All of the seats would be filled soon, but I was up front! My husband started to smile as he saw my joy. The lights dimmed and a wave of screams erupted as music began to play. In a flash of lights NKOTB took the stage. I felt like a young teen again! My husband laughed and smiled as he saw me jump up and down with overflowing excitement. I began dancing to the music and he couldn't help but stand up and dance along. He was having fun simply because I was. It was the ultimate night. On the way home we laughed and talked about the show. I couldn't thank him enough for such a wonderful experience."
