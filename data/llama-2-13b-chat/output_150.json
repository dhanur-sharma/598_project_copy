Perhaps his military discipline at play? I am not really sure. I got to see it full force when i went to visit mary around 6 months back. Right after i entered, i saw her dad. He was surprisingly old, with grey hair. He was always young and strong in my memories of him. We exchanged pleasantries. I was actually looking forward to help Mary in the kitchen. However, her dad insisted on joining him for drinks and watching the game in the TV. I couldn't refuse, of course. The day was definitely saved by Mary's delicious Italian diner."

He was a bit too talkative for my taste, but he was a good guy. I left around 7 pm, and i could see the relief on Mary's face. She was glad to have me gone. It was a bit awkward after that. We still texted and spoke on the phone, but it wasn't the same. I realized that Mary's dad had a big influence on her life. He was always there, watching and guiding her. I couldn't help but feel a bit jealous of their bond. I missed the old Mary, who was carefree and independent. I knew that i couldn't change her or her dad, so i just accepted the new reality. I still cared for Mary deeply, but our relationship had changed.\n\n"
