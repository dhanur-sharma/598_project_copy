But, I know this is the best thing I can do. I give it to you God.  I pray the facility treats her well. I promise I will go check on her everyday. I wonder sometimes if I did the right thing. I could have tried to at least try and see if she could live with me for a while. But my apartment is so small. I truly believe she will do fine once she settles into the place. I feel truly guilty. But on the other hand, I feel relief. Extreme relief! I was truly coming to a breaking point. I have two other siblings and I am the only one who helped mom. I am going to say my prayers and try to get a good night sleep."
