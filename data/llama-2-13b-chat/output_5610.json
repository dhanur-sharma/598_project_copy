        "Summarize the following story in first person: I have lived in the U.S since I was four years old. I never felt like I was \u201cillegal\u201d. That is until I was 16 and it was time to get a job. Fortunately around that time DACA was started, and I have been legally working for about 8 years. Last year in July I married my long time boyfriend. Then in October we filed to fix my status. All this to say when I received the case approval letter I was overcome with joy. And for someone who is not usually very emotional publicly, it was extremely moving. Although it really didn\u2019t fix anything I suppose being so close to never having to worry about renewing a work permit. Even more the thought of actually being able to meet my family outside of the U.S was very impactful. I was at work, I remember I worked with Rosendo one of my employees who is the same nationality and also able to work because of DACA. I received a message from my mom with a picture of the letter. Suddenly that was it I was beaming, bouncing with joy. Having someone who understood around really added to the experience. I high-fived him and my eyes were a bit watery. I can\u2019t  imagine how I\u2019ll feel when this is all over...which is hopefully very soon."
