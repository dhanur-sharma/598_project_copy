        "Summarize the following story in first person: My mom and I went over to my sisters house for the first time in months. We both do not have a good relationship with her because she is kind of insane. We went there just to see my niece, her granddaughter. We were expecting the usual fighting with my sister, but were surprised at how normal and nice she was. She greeted us with a smile for the first time in years, she made us dinner, she answered our questions, and didn't yell once. My mom and I were looking at each other throughout the 3 hour stay because we wanted to see each others' reactions to this. My sister even asked us about our lives and what has been going on. This has NEVER happened before. What was even more surprising, as I already said, was that she answered our questions. I asked if she was still working at the same spot, she said no and told me where she works now. Had this been even 5 months ago she would have replied with 'why do you want to know?' We then asked her if we could take my niece out to get some ice cream. She said yes right away, which, again, never happens. She even came with us and treated us all. This all sounds really normal to most people, but my sister has been a psycho for ten years now and having a good time with her really made my year. My mom even cried on the way home."
