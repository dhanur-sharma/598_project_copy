        "Summarize the following story in first person: A month ago my parents threw a birthday party for my mother, who's climbing up in age. She just recovered from a midlife crisis--menopause will do that to you. She was all tears, and me and my father decided that it would be best to cheer her up with a party for her birthday, and invite all her friends! Unfortunately, a lot were busy or out of town during that week. They promised to send a letter or a text, and I felt a little sorry, but that's life, I guess? Me and my father were excited regardless, we had set up the house to look amazing for her birthday--streamers everywhere, balloons, the lot! I knew she would be happy. She likes classic things like that. Anyway, she was really happy with the fact we did it for her! A few people showed up, her best friend included. We had our aunts fly out to see her, too. However, afterwards I could tell she wasn't happy with the fact that only a handful of people showing up. She was lonely, I get it. But I guess she felt abandoned a little bit? My mother is very popular, and she takes pride in the number of friends she had. I comforted her, but I understood she needed time to process it. I knew she was grateful for those who did show up, though."
