        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was at the end of may, and me and my wife decided it was time for a huge change. We had both been working for many years and after the birth of our first child nearly four years ago we decided it would be time for a change eventually. Well, that day finally came. We made the decision at the end of may for one of us to stop working.  That decision ended up being me. I was the one to remain home. Because her job was such a success and mine was mediocre, the decision was pretty clear.  After we made the decision we felt a peace over the whole thing. It had been years of us taking our daughter to family members to be babysat. Enough was enough. We had spent enough money and time that we knew we couldn't do it any longer. With two kids now it was an obvious choice. The first day I stayed home was challenging, but amazing. I really warmed up to the task. Things got harder as time went on but that day was a good first step. I am glad things are progressing nicely and am proud at what we have accomplished."
