        "Summarize the following story in first person: Over the whole summer, I had been teaching a class of non-traditional students. The discussions always went well, but I didn't get much feedback other than that. On the last day of class, some of the students wrote \"We love you!\" on the attendance sheet. That made me feel appreciated. It confirmed that the students cared about me. After the final exam, several students emailed me as well. One student said it was the best class he had ever taken. Multiple of them thanked me for the experience. Again, it made me feel like I was in the right career. I had been having doubts previously about whether to continue in my teaching program. This experience helped me to realize that I was doing the right this. I comparison, the classes that I am TAing for now are not as good. I think the students appreciate me but I will maybe not get that level of feedback. I was actually told by the administrative error that the school never conducted teaching evalutions for those sections, so I never even got full feedback. It won't even count for my teaching portfolio. But even just that note was enough to motivate me."
