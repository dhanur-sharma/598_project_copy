        "Summarize the following story in first person: I finally got out of the hospital. It all started in the evening 3 nights ago. I was watching TV and started feeling confused. I reached over to grab my remote to change channels,, and I couldn't keep a hold of it. I tried with 2 hands but then I couldn't push the buttons, and forgot what channel I was changing to anyway. I started thinking it was a stroke. I grabbed my tablet to look up symptoms and within seconds forgot the word stroke. I live alone so I started speaking out loud and I couldn't talk correctly. I found out I could walk, so I walked the 15 minutes to the VA hospital which is on my street. I had a hard time communicating at the desk but finally got in to see a doctor. I couldn't communicate with the doctors. I tried to write but words would disappear from my head. I also couldn't hold the pen, so it was moot to even try with my left hand. They finally did a CT scan and I had a old subdural hemotoma, which I determined was about 6 months before,it was just above my left ear from a fall off a electric scooter. The doctors ruled out a normal stroke, It was called a mini stroke and after a few days cleared it self up and I was about 95% and was finally discharged."
