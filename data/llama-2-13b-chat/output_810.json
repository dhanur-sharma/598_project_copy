        "Summarize the following story in first person: About two months ago, my parents decided to take the family on a trip to Honduras. Mom, Dad, my twin sister Hope, and I boarded the plane in NYC and flew down to Phoenix, where we switched to a flight to San Pedro Sula. We landed in the heat and humidity of Central America, and got a shuttle to our hotel on the beach. Our rooms were beautiful, on the eight floor, and we quickly unpacked, showered, and changed. It was now early afternoon, so we decided to grab a late lunch and decide what to do with the rest of the day. There was a cool-looking bar and restaurant right on the beach, so we walked down there and got a table. It was the tail-end of lunchtime, so the place wasn't too busy and we didn't have to wait for our table. Our waiter was pleasant and knowledgeable, and we ordered a couple different seafood dishes. I recall that I ordered fish tacos, Hope ordered a shrimp cocktail, and Mom and Dad ordered something different from either of us so we could share. A short while after getting our food (which was delicious), the bartender came over with four drinks. He told us they had been ordered by someone who had then left in a hurry and he was going to throw them out unless we wanted them. They were typical \"resort\" looking drinks, with umbrellas and fruit, and we gladly accepted them. About ten minutes after this, I began feeling a little queasy. I looked over at Hope, and she looked unhappy as well. I didn't say a word, just nodded, and looked at our parents. They didn't seem to be having a problem, but as I watched, my father suddenly coughed and turned red. \"I think we should get to our rooms right now,\" I said to him, and he nodded and took his wallet out. Mom was doing the best of us at the moment, but we were all rapidly feeling worse. She grabbed the waiter and gave him plenty of cash, and we all made our way to the hotel lobby. Waiting for the elevator seemed to take an eternity, but we finally got to the eighth floor and into our rooms, where we spent the rest of the night in our own miseries, throwing up and getting fitful sleep. Around 7 am, I suddenly realized I felt fine. I checked on everyone else, and they were rousing themselves, feeling okay as well. Whatever had been given to us seemed to run its course then disappeared completely. We never figured out why this had happened, and chalked it up to bad luck (bad luck for us; perhaps very good luck for someone else). We enjoyed the rest of our vacation - but never went back to that restaurant on the beach!"
