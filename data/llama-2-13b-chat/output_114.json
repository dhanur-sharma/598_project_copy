        "Summarize the following story in first person: My mom has always been a bit of an addictive personality type. Growing up she always dreamed of winning the lottery and couldnt stop. This caused my dad to leave. After he left she turned to alcohol. She ended up losing her job and her home and came to live with me. In my culture it is seen as taboo to turn away family so I just couldnt. 3 weeks ago it hit a tipping point though. I came back from the gym and mom was passed out. She puked on the floor and an entire bottle of wine was unwrapped and consumed. I woke her up and she sarcastically apologized. She asked me to clean it up and that she would be better and i couldnt stand it. I went to my room and slammed the bathroom door shut. because i moved it so quickly it pushed the towel rack over and ended up falling into the wall leaving a huge dent in the drywall. Not only is my house a mess because of her, now i broke my wall. I cant stand her and something needs to change."
