        "Summarize the following story in first person: A while ago my new neighbor moved in. For a bit of background, I live in a basement apartment in a house. Half of the time, the upstairs is an AirBNB, the other half it is rented by other tenants. The upstairs has two bedrooms, while down here is just one. Anyway, the previous neighbors were a couple, they were pretty nice, they have a dog. My new neighbor is a younger guy, who also has a dog. When he moved in my landlords let me know he was moving in. I decided to bake him some cookies, so I biked down to the grocery store to get chocolate chips. He started moving in, and I made the cookies. I overheard my landlord mentioning that she was thinking about baking cookies but did not because it was too hot out, so I was relieved that I wouldn't be doing something redundant. I finished the cookies and was nervous about bringing them up. Was the timing good, would he be busy? I am nervous about talking to people. Eventually I put them on a plate, covered the plate with plastic wrap, and brought them up before they lost too much heat. My neighbor was out there, near his car, I talked to him and handed him the cookies which he accepted. His mother was helping him move in, I shook her hand and talked to her also. Once the conversation seemed like it was winding down I said I'd let him get back to moving in and went back inside. Also I gave him a card with my phone number."
