        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was my grandsons 8th birthday part a few weeks ago.  My daughter and I had done a lot of planning for this party because it was the first time that he got to invite some of his friends from the previous  year at school.  He wanted to have it at a local \"jumping\" and bouncy place. He got to pick out which cake he wanted which was Fortnite themed. I ended up dropping a piece of the cake on the floor while serving others. Everyone started laughing and I felt a bit embarrassed about it. Thinking about it now I start to laugh a little bit about how shocked some of the kids faces were when it happened. I was very excited for this party because my sister who I had not seen in a few years was making the flight out from California. Being able to spend some time with her got me excited because we don't get to see each other that much due to the fact that she lives in a different state. The party was great and the best part for me was seeing the joy in my grandsons face when he was his friends from schooling coming to his party. Watching him interact with them was great. Being able to spend times like this with my family is really the most important thing for me. I've been so work focused throughout my career that I didn't appreciate little things such as birthday parties in the past. It was great spending a few day with my sister as well. One of the most memorable things about this party was the family photo we took at the end. Its probably one of my favorite pictures I've ever taken. I look at the picture literally every time I am looking at pictures on my phone. I plan on getting the picture printed and framed. To be able to see how much everyone has grown up and to see my family happy really means the world to me."
