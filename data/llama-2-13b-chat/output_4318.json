        "Summarize the following story in first person: My girlfriend and I had been talking for some time but hadn't really gone 'in depth' in our discussions. After we sparked up a conversation everything just happened. It just happened. We went from one topic to another and just couldn't get enough of each other. Eventually I quit my job and just ran off with her, we would talk for something like 7-10 hours a day. Religion played such a large role in our experiences. It was like everything in the world was speaking to us, through us, through the world, and through others. The biggest thing was music. We both experienced it, the music was just speaking directly to us. Not just interpreting it that way but like, everything was relevant to our moments together. Everything just flowed perfectly in perfect synchronicity, Everything was perfect. It was like, yea we had been waiting all our lives for this. And God just temporarily removed our blindness and we all celebrated our coming together. It was all just about love and harmony. Everything was just perfect."
