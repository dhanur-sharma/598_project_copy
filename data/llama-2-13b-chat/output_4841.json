        "Summarize the following story in first person: A significant event that happened to me not so long ago was in regards to travelling to South America. I traveled with my older brother to Peru, Cuzco. There, we able to visit the ancient civilization of the Incas.  We got to see some ancient and magnificent  ruins and most importantly we got to see Machu Picchu, which is one of the 7 wonders of the world. The view was memorizing and the ambient felt so intact and pure. Is looking at nature untouched by mankind. The air look so pure and felt fresh. The animal seemed to enjoyed their habitat aside from mankind.  Besides, Machu Picchu, we got to visit some of the Roman Cathedral that was constructed by the Spaniards. We learn that the Spanish sail to South America to conquer lands of the native and try to convert them to a different culture and religion. We learn that because the land back then hid so much gold and silver, the Spanish decided to come here and exploit the natives.  The Spanish thought that the native's ways of living was uncivilized and need to be more educated. They took their natural lands and force it into property and ownership which is an idea that the natives found absurd. The natives appreciated the land in which they lived in and it was sacred but they never view the land as property . They were also polytheism, believed in many Gods such as the sun, the moon, the mountains and etc... The Spanish that this was ridiculous so they force the natives in to Catholicism. It was sad that the native's culture and language (Quechua) was wiped out from the ethnocentrism of the Spanish.  Evidently it was a culture clash and became part of history."
