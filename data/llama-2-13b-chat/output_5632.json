        "Summarize the following story in first person: I remember when I met Sandra. Sandra was quite agile for a woman of over 80 years of age. She usually  tells me story anytime I run into at the park. A story stood that I could never forget, it was so sad and sweet at the same time. The story was about Sandra's dead granddaughter Chelsea. Chelsea died at 24 years of age, due to a car accident. From Sandra's story I could tell Chelsea was a funny, beautiful, and nice girl. Sandra and Chelsea were obviously very close. Sandra tells me about the time Chelsea got featured in an Art collection by a photographer who was very fond of her and the photographs were so good that it is currently on display at a museum. Sandra tells me about how she found peace after going through so much emotional pain when Chelsea died. What she does to forget the pain of Chelsea' death is probably one of the most surprising and sweetest thing I have ever heard. She goes to the museum regularly to see the photographs of Chelsea and she claims this does not only help her remember who Chelsea was but also her mother. She goes further to say, this is the best way to deal with a loss. Not by forgetting the people we lost but by remembering them for who they were. She goes on to invite to come to the museum with her the following week. All I can say is that I cannot wait to meet Chelsea."
