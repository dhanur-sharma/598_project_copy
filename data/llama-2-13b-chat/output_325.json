        "Summarize the following story in first person: I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s been six months. Six of the longest months of my life. It\u2019s taken a long time for me to come to grips with what\u2019s transpired, but I feel I am finally ready to put it into words. I remember it was beautiful that day. I was at work wishing I wasn\u2019t. Imagine my surprise when the line shut down and they sent us all home. I thought I\u2019d surprise Linda by showing up home early. I was the one with the surprise of my life. I knew something was up when I walked in. Linda was sitting on the couch and shed obviously been crying. I asked, and she told me she\u2019d been having an affair with our friend Steve. I left on the spot. In hindsight, I should\u2019ve taken Ralphie with me. But I just wanted to get out of there. Instead, she went down to the courts the next day and filed for custody. It took five months to settle this stupid custody mess. And in the meanwhile, I\u2019ve spent my entire savings. $23,000 cash. I think the lawyer might have done me dirtier than my ex in some ways. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll ever recover financially. Thought about ending it a couple times too. I\u2019m glad I talked myself down. Funny how things work in the end. I may be broke, but at least I have my kiddo. Here\u2019s to a fresh start!"
