        "Summarize the following story in first person: About a few months ago, I bought a house that I really liked and it was very pleasing to me. It had the number of rooms that I wanted and it was in a condition (aesthetically) that I loved. By this I mean that certain rooms like the kitchen and bathroom were up-to-date and I didn't have to do much to fix these places to be more to my liking. Because the house was so beautiful, I decided to get the works with it - I invested in a gate, a few security cameras and have a subscription to ADT to make sure that everything is protected. To be honest, all of these things make em feel very safe. It is in a great neighborhood where I know all of the people who live in the community and even the association people are friendly and nice to all of us that live here. The most memorable thing that I recall in this house is finding it to begin with. Before getting this house, there was a period of time in my life where I was deeply into the movies that centered around beautiful natural phenomena, like red tide or the aurora borealis. After praying that I could find someplace good to live with all the bells and whistles I wanted, I went onto Zillow to find my prefect place. I found a place, someplace gorgeous that had all the amenities I was looking for at a price I loved. In a good area, I deigned to look at what the street was called and lo and behold the house was on Aurora Lane. I knew this house was meant for me and it showed that my religion always comes though for me. I do believe there is a God up there and this experience has shown me that it is indeed the case, the way things matched up so surprisingly nicely and personally to me. I wish someone else could have an experience like mine because I loved how it all went about. Fast forward to today and I have worked on many areas to improve the way the house looks and it is even more to how I prefer it."
