I saw someone who is the world to me just deteriorate right in front of me. my mother was riding the bus after work and she had a seizure but she didn't tell anyone about it. my mother again had a seizure while riding a bus but this time in front of the driver who calls an ambulance who they call her sons. finally we get some info on what was happening to her and she never told us why she didn't say anything to us about the seizures. well we knew it was seizures she was having instead of passing out because she went to the doctors. the doctors diagnoses was brain cancer. which is the worst thing that can happen to you. the doctors said it was pretty grim but there might a chance. so she got eight weeks of radiation treatment which just hit her like a ton of bricks. she became listless but the radiation didn't take. the doctors had one last medicine a pill that would kill all the cells in her brain. she took it and she got sent into a coma because of it. and she died shortly there after."
