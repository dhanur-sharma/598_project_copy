        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was my youngest daughter's birthday party. We were in a rented room in the library that is reserved for parties when my son came up to me to show me he had a \"bump\" in his groin area. The was a large lump but I didn't think too much of it. I was thinking he is a dirty boy, loves to be outside, he is rough, he touches everything. I am sure he just got an infection somehow. We took him to the doctor and they thought he also had an infection. They gave him an antibiotic. It did not work, the lymph nodes just got bigger. They tried a different antibiotic and a day later they felt even bigger. So our doctor sent us for an ultrasound. That came back with extremely enlarged lymph nodes. So he wanted a ct. While we were waiting for insurance to approve the ct, he noticed swollen lymph nodes on his neck. Now the doctor wanted a second ct of his neck and feared the worst..lymphoma. Not just any lymphoma, but an aggressive later stage lymphoma. After the ct revealed extremely swollen lymph nodes from the neck down the trachea to the groin the doctor told us he was 85% certain it was lymphoma and sent us for a biopsy. The surgeon disagreed with the doctor that is was lymphoma. He was convinced given the history that it was cat scratch fever. Sure enough, the results came back and it was cat scratch fever. Not just cat scratch fever, but the levels of this bacteria in his system was off the charts!"
