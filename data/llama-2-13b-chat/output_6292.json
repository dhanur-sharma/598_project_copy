        "Summarize the following story in first person: Two weeks ago I hosted a birthday for Khloe. I had planned this event so that I felt that everything should go well. I thought the day would be easy and successful. I got up early to pick up the final things for the party. I needed to pick up some helium filled balloons. I could not do this ahead of time since the helium would leak out. Next I went to pick up the cake. I wanted it to be as fresh as possible. Having done these last two chores, I returned home. When I unpacked my car, I realized that I had lost my wallet. Oh well, I will call these business concerns later and see if I can locate it. Everyone arrived and things seemed to be going well when out of nowhere Autumn puked. What a mess! I had to clean this up as quickly as possible and make the best of a messy situation. At least the cake was okay. Boy was I glad when this day was over. Everyone seemed to have a good time and now on to find my wallet. I made a few calls and was beginning to panic when some wonderful person knocked at my door and returned my wallet. What a day!"
