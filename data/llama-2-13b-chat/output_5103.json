        "Summarize the following story in first person: My wife and I have been trying to get pregnant for a little over a year now. We've gone to the doctor to get checked, we've tried pills and things of that nature to help things along, we've done a lot of things and yet we still haven't managed to get it to go through. We've continuously tried and failed with my wife finding new things for us to try every couple of months or so. Last month however, something finally clicked with us. On the 18th of August, my wife came downstairs in the morning to wake me up with a very big smile on her face. I asked her what she was so happy about and she told me that we were finally going to be having a child. I couldn't believe it, we'd been trying so hard to make it happen and finally we'd managed to pull it off. I was ecstatic and we went out to breakfast that morning to celebrate and discuss all our plans for our child. I will always remember that morning, it's one of the happiest times in my life. We went to McDonald's, I got an Egg McMuffin, she got a Sausage McMuffin, and we just sat there and talked about everything we needed to figure out before our son or daughter arrived. We both kind of want a son, however we will be very happy regardless of the gender. I think what will be the most memorable thing about this event is just the impact that it's going to have on my life. I've always wanted to have a kid, however I know that I can't fully appreciate everything that's going to go into it. That moment will be the distinct split between my young life and my adult life. It's a scary concept that I'm going to be in charge of something as important as the life of another person, however it's a challenge that I welcome with open arms."
