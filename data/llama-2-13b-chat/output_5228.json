        "Summarize the following story in first person: I remember the events so clearly even now. It has been around a year and a half ago that my dad was able to recover from his sickness in time to make it for my sisters wedding. My dad had been diagnosed with congestive heart failure. He was given not to long to live by doctors. But my dad never gave up hope. He began exercising and changing his habits. In fact, my entire family has picked up working out, eating healthy, and exercising as main goals in our lives. Since the whole ordeal that my family has been through, it has made my family so much stronger, and more appreciative. We try and do as many family gatherings as we can and have positive celebrations together. We recently went took a trip to Las Vegas for Christmas day. We went with both of my older sisters family's, that are now married into the family. We ordered a very large air BnB with 8 bedrooms and a guest house to fit everybody. We had a very special dinner on Christmas that brought all of the family's much closer together. I personally got to spend time and get closer to my new brother in-laws. It was a great experience for all of our families to get to know each other and grow together into a family that will last a lifetime."
