        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was sitting at home alone watching a movie on my off night, I had just finished eating dinner when I received a text from my friend. It said \"Have you talked to [Friend's name] recently?\". I said no, and she responded with a paragraph of text that seemed to radiate anxiety.   She reached out to me, because she thought that I lived in the same neighborhood as my friend, and thought it would be quick and easy to check in on him. I told her that I moved a couple miles away and she said don't worry. But I basically leapt off the couch and jumped a bus going northbound. I told her it wouldn't be an inconvenience because I was worried as well and I had nothing to do. When I went to the subway station I was more anxious than before and it was only building. I called my friend twice while waiting for the train. I was worried that he had been mugged or assaulted, which has previously happened to him before. I texted him after a while and it was a relatively long paragraph. After a while I got a text from him that he sent to my other friend and myself, saying 'y'all are crazy' and he then thanked me for my concern. My other friend also privately thanked me for helping her out. I felt like I did something good. I felt a nice warm sense of validation and that I hadn't lost those friends."
