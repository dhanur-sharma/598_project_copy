        "Summarize the following story in first person: The weeks leading up to my daughter going off to college were kind of stressful and there was some anxiety about the limited time we had with her at home.  I recall the day we left for her move in day.  i thought it was going to be tear filled and sad, but there was more excitement and forward thinking on the way out to Buffalo NY.  She was excited to start her new life away from the day to day home life and start moving towards her academic and professional goals in he new life going forward.  We found that she joined a couple of groups at school related to her chosen pre-dental profession and related academics in sciences and math.  She also is involved in a networking group to stay up to date on changes and trends in dental fields and orthodontics.  i'm excited for her and happy to see her drive and ambition so early on in her collegiate career.  As we reflected back on the month or so building up to moving her off to school, my wife and I seemed to realize that our feelings, though justified, were more about how we felt and our anxiousness about her leaving and not really about how she felt and what her ambitions are,  I am glad we found that she was looking forward to this new life and that she was nervous like us but seems to have it under control.  She has a roommate and other friends in the same pre-dental studies and they work well together and have a study group.  That makes me proud as a parent and glad to see that my worries were for nothing and she is so well adjusted to college life.  High school seems so long ago and the strides she has taken in the past couple of months are impressive.  Maybe it is because of necessity but nonetheless she is ahead of the curve related to others I have seen and heard about at her stage of the game.  As parents we have gone from worrying stressed out and nervous people to proud and excited parents.  The transition has been painless and she has led the way without our interaction.  I think the most impressive part is that she is not the same person at school as she is at home.  She is very quiet, sort of lazy, and not proactive at home and it seems she is the ultra opposite away at school.  I would like to say it is like that for most parents a they see their oldest grow up fast and do well but some friends and neighbors have some stories that would make me cringe at what they tell me if it is true."
