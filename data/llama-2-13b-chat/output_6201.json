        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was ready for my fourth child to enter the world two months ago. We had a bit of old and new to greet our youngest. Our oldest donated her more than loved stuffed panda. Our boys helped pick out some of the toys and elephant pajamas for the newest addition to our family. My husband and I had our hospital packed and ready to go by the door. Everything was perfect. Until It wasn't.The first portent that things weren't going the way we planned was when we couldn't get our usual obstetrician. Unfortunately she had a sudden heart attack just an hour before I went into labor. The unfamiliar doctor we had seemed annoyed by us. I didn't know what her deal was at the time. I don't care. She didn't give her due as a doctor. She ignored my pleas that something was wrong and ended up delaying my epidural until I was past the point of receiving it. Then as soon as I delivered my child, I passed out. When I awoke hours later, my husband filled me in. Apparently I began to hemorrhage and lost a lot of blood. He assured me that our newborn daughter was okay. My mother was on her way after hearing about me. I wondered if there was anything the doctor could've done to prevent it. Even two months later, we still wonder if that day could've been perfect after all."
