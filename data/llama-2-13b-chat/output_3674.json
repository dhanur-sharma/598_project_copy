        "Summarize the following story in first person: June 1, 2019  I did it I got married! It was amazing! I cant believe we finally took the plunge. It was perfect for us. I was late our best friend married us and everyone who we love was there. My dad walked me down the isle. I married the man of my dreams. There were a few minor things I would have changed. But really it was amazing! I wish things would have went a little smoother. The d.j. was late so we didn't get music while I walked down the isle. I forgot my wedding band and had to improvise. The food was amazing. I got way drunker then I should have. A acted like a hooker and was making out with every single female she could, she even attempted to finger a girl without their consent and that pissed me off. Our minister got dropped by a friend of ours while they were paying around on the dance floor. My step son did his very first ever karaoke song \"every rose has its thorn\" and it was the sweetest thing ever. Another friend of mine sang  \"tennesee whiskey for me and every one kept taking the mic from him witch upset me because I know he had been practicing the song for months to surprise me. But honestly I got to marry my best friend and partner in life. so what more could I possibly ask for?"
