        "Summarize the following story in first person: My life changed forever on March 25, 2000, on a bench at the foot of the Eiffel Tower. It was an overcast afternoon and a light rain had just started to fall. With prettily wrapped French pastries in hand, I was looking for a place to sit and enjoy my treat. My traveling companion suggested an uncovered bench next to a small reflecting pool. I suggested a well-covered bench about 10 feet away. Much to my chagrin, my companion forced me to the uncovered bench. After sitting down, I quickly opened our treats. When I turned back to face my companion, he was not on the bench; rather, he was on one knee in front of me holding a Claddagh ring&#151the Irish wedding bandAfter Jeff, my traveling companion and boyfriend of three years, asked me to marry him, I was speechless. I was so drawn into the beauty of the moment that it took me a few seconds to respond. But, after much hugging and kissing, I said, \u201cYesJeff and I set our wedding date for Aug. 11, 2001. That meant that I would have less than a year and a half to plan a wedding, keep everything in order and enjoy the moment. From that moment on, every childhood fantasy of my wedding day was coming at me at lightning speed. I knew then that I would need to do something to stay organized and to remember every moment of the most wonderful time in my life. That\u2019s when I turned to a wedding journal. When I tried to keep journals in the past, I would just use a notebook or loose paper, only to find that a month later I had either abandoned the notebook or lost the sheets of paper. So, this time I decided to take a different route when a friend gave me To Have and to Hold, A Wedding Journal. Ironically, but appropriately, the guided journal is published by the My Chaotic Life division of Walter Foster Publishing. I soon found out that chaos is the catchphrase when you are planning a wedding. I enjoyed using a guided journal for discipline, but using a journal that is blank inside is just as helpful. I know because I kept one of those, tooThe guided journal helped to keep me focused but I soon discovered that there were things missing that I really wanted to include. For example, Jeff and I decided to write a short piece that we would read to each other after we exchanged our vows. There wasn\u2019t a space in the guided journal for me to jot down thoughts or ideas for this \u201cuntraditional\u201d element, so I added notes on this into the pages of my personal wedding journal. Having space to explore my ideas helped me to write those special words"

The flames of the candles would represent the joining of our hearts, our families and our lives. I loved the idea of this symbolism, but I needed to have a space to write down the details of how to execute this element. With a guided journal, there wasn\u2019t enough space, so I turned to my personal journal. In the end, the guided journal helped me to stay focused and on track, but the personal journal helped me to remember the important details that made our wedding day so special. The guided journal helped me to remember the big picture and my personal journal helped me to remember the small details. My wedding journal is filled with memories that I will treasure for the rest of my life.\nThe story is about the author's experience of getting engaged and planning her wedding. She describes the moment when her boyfriend proposed to her at the Eiffel Tower and how she used a wedding journal to stay organized and remember the details of her special day. She found that the guided journal helped her to stay focused,"
