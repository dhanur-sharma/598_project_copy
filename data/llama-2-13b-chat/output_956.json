        "Summarize the following story in first person: 6 months ago I lost my grandfather to cancer. He had stage 4 bladder cancer. Seeing him that sick killed me. He lived less than a year after his diagnosis. I was very close to my grandfather. He was my world. He was funny, kind, sweet, and caring. I made sure to visit him every month. At his funeral, I tried to keep a stiff upper lift for his wife, my grandmother. I didn't want her to see my weakness. The funeral was held at the church he grew up in and where the rest of his family was buried. It was a cold day. My fingers were frozen as I waited by an empty 6 foot hole in the ground. I did not want him to be there. It was cold, he was going to freeze. I wanted to be with him, to keep him warm. I talked to my grandmother, trying my best to keep her mind off of this. Seeing her this way just broke my heart. It was a small funeral, about 12 people there. My grandmother's sister tried to hold onto her too letting her know it will be ok. Finally, a pastor said a prayer and his casket was lowered into the grown with red carnations that were adorned on top. Tears were streaming down my face as the wind whipped at them. I kept my head down, I didn't want anyone to see me this upset, I had to be strong. Once the casket was in the ground, everyone dispersed and we went out to eat for lunch. No one wanted to see the dirt that was going to be piled on top."
