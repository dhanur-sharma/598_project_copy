        "Summarize the following story in first person: Today was like any other day, I was happy and in love. When I say this came out of nowhere I really mean it. I woke up and did my morning ritual. I made coffee and breakfast for myself and my girlfriend. We normally survive on coffee and something simple to eat. I cooked our favorite which we, I, call egg in a hole. As soon as my girlfriend, or should I say ex-girlfriend by now, entered the kitchen, something felt off. I looked at her face and got a tinge of fear. She looked so serious when she's normally so bubbly. From that moment, all time slowed down but yet everything felt like a blur. First she said she needed to talk to me. I panicked and she must have saw it because she tried to calm me. She said that had found someone else and was no longer in love with me. My heart sank. It came out of nowhere, or I missed all the signs. I begged and pleaded with her not to leave me. I might have made a fool of myself, I cringe when I think of it. I was crushed and began to cry. She left after eating. I couldn't eat and just went to my bed. I drifted in and out of sleep because when I slept it didn't hurt."
