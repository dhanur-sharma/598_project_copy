        "Summarize the following story in first person: I\u2019ve been avoiding writing about this for 7 weeks. It\u2019s hard to watch your parents change as they get older. Seven weeks ago was my parent\u2019s fiftieth wedding anniversary. I can\u2019t believe they made it that long, it\u2019s a huge deal. We threw a party, nothing too crazy because of their mobility issues, but we had a bunch of family fly out and a few close friends too. My brother couldn\u2019t make it out, or at least he chose not to. Maybe it\u2019s better he wasn\u2019t there, he always adds stress and I don\u2019t think he would\u2019ve handled things well. In any case, during the day we all sat around and watched old family videos and looked through photo albums. My father went upstairs to take a nap before dinner. My mom and most of the family sat in the living room chatting and playing games. Rob and Jess and I went to the kitchen to start making dinner. We made a huge spread with everyone\u2019s favorites, or most of everyone\u2019s favorites anyway. We planned to eat at 6:00pm and we finished cooking almost exactly as the yellowthroat on my mother\u2019s bird clock cheeped 6. My father hadn\u2019t come down yet and my mother said to let him rest a little longer. I went and hung out in the living room with everyone and had a little wine. Before we knew it, it was 6:30 and the food was starting to get cold, still no Pop. Jess went up and knocked on his door and told him dinner was ready and he yelled back that he was coming. When he got downstairs he was pale, his foot falls seemed heavy, and he had this lost look on his face somewhere between a blank stare and scowl. He asked what everyone was doing here. We reminded him it was his anniversary and he seemed even more confused. He didn\u2019t even seem to recognize anyone except Mom. It was terribly awkward. My Mom lives with him so she is most familiar with his forgetfulness, but even she didn\u2019t think he\u2019d forget their fiftieth wedding anniversary, especially after spending time with the family all morning. I\u2019ll never forget the desperate look on my Mother\u2019s face \u2014 then again, maybe I will if this runs in the family. I need to stop."
