        "Summarize the following story in first person: My partner and I recently moved to a new state, just across the border. But this meant about a couple hours drive for family to see us. After a short while we were having my mother come stay with us. Knowing my mother I know she likes this to be particular. She also really loves our home state and doesn't want to move from it. She's a New Englander through and through but feels that some of the major states, like Mass and NY are too busy for her. Anyway, she arrived the Friday and would be staying for a week. We spent the first day or two getting her settled in and showing my mom how we lived. How we liked to cook, how we used our little firepit outside our home and how much space our dog had to run around. She seemed to be quite happy staying with us. We went out one night for dinner and she loved the city so much we stayed out, getting drinks and bar hopping for hours. I think she really took too and enjoy the time being in a new city and state and being around different people. After the days rolled by and we spent our evenings together she got really involved. She cooked in our kitchen, made a meal for us, we drank lots of wine and watched movies on the couch. We just enjoyed the cool evenings of summer out on our patio, by the fire, cooking outside and having fun. After the week ended and she was preparing to head back, she asked about coming back with my dad when he could get off work for a weekend. This was thrilling, it was amazing to have my mother be so excited about joining us out here and wanting to spend more time with us. We made plans and they'll be coming out in just a few days. I can't wait!"
