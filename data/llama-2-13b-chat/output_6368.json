        "Summarize the following story in first person: 3 weeks ago my daugter took a job at my company. I was appalled. I don't ahve a problem with her working. I don't think I should e controlling her life, but my job is crucial to my success in life. Having my child working there throws a wrench into the works that could potentially hurt me. I spoke to my ex-wife about the subject. She doesn;t really seem to think it's a big deal. If it were her career on the line she would defintiely not have this stand as it is. Considering it's only me though, go figure. THere's your typical man/woman double standard. #MetooI spoke to my wife about my daugters past work record and questionable ethics. For the msot aprt she agrees, but I the sense that she's not as heavily invested in the very important issue as I am. While that's udnerstandable, it's also very frustrating being that I am the bread winner in our relationship. I kind of feel like a little emotional spousal support is due. I really want to be supportive of my kid, but I also have to be able to independence and job security. What's a guy to do."
