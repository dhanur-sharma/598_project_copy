        "Summarize the following story in first person: Five weeks ago, my life changed.  The woman that I dated for 17 months break up with me. As I think about it I should have saw it coming.  She was avoiding my calls the last three weeks.  It seems that she was always busy.  I was really in love.  I believe that this is the person that I wanted to spend my life with.  I was even looking at rings.  I feel so stupid just thinking about it.  What went wrong?  Did we grow apart?  Did she find another lover? I have many questions but no answers.  She would not give me an answer.  She told me that she wanted to date other people. I was really shock by this revelation.  I thought about going to her house and demanding answers. I know that it sounds crazy but I need resolutions.  If she can't give it to me then I will have to seek therapy.  I tell myself that it is for the best now because if I had married her then we would have ended up divorcing.  My friends tell me that I escape a bullet.  This is a good way to look at it but to be honest it really hurts.  My feelings for her were really real. So, now I take it slow.  I don't need to be in a relationship at this time."
