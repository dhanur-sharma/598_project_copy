        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was the worst email I have ever received. It arrived about five months ago on a normal Wednesday morning as I sipped my coffee from my desk. The ominous title of the email said \"Urgent: Future of Company\". I knew something was up before I even clicked to open it. Our boss had decided to automate most of the company going forward in a spur of the moment decision. Something about cutting costs and making a shift towards automated intelligence, he said. The only thing that mattered was the fact that we were given two months before we would effectively be phased out of our jobs. Entire departments were being replaced with robots to perform the same tasks. Pretty soon the water cooler talk was crazy, and the entire mood of the office became more somber than a funeral. Over those last few weeks it was tough having to say goodbye to so many colleagues I had built a rapport with over the years. Real people. The type who can form friendships that can't exactly be duplicated by a robot. My job search, which basically began when I opened the email, has yet to offer up much hope. In turn this has really affected my mental state, and it's tough remaining optimistic about new openings when I've been turned down so many times. I know my old boss did what he felt was best for the company, but I don't think I can forgive him for the way he tossed so many good people out on the street like he did."
