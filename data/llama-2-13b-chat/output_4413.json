        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was looking through some old(er) videos that were sent to me when my wife was only my girlfriend. We were having issues and I felt that she was withdrawing from me, most noticeably, in a sexual manner. Seeking out sexual releases, I looked to some videos she had sent me approximately 2 years earlier. After I played with the audio for my own liking, I realized that I was hearing a couple male voices and one female voice on a video that was designed for me only. When I asked her about it, she said I was hearing things that were not there. That is when I took a closer look at even older videos. I found one other video in which I heard a male voice. When I questioned her about it, she denied it of course. Then I went to even older videos, and I realized that she was watching something over and over and that those videos were made in advance of them being sent to me. Yes, I did \"tweak\" the speed and enhance the audio, but that did not affect the fact that I realized that she was watching a video. I discovered that she was watching the same video over and over as she performed a solo sexual act. As I became better adapted to settings that would bring out background audio and hard to see objects in a visual sense I started seeing what I was previously being distracted from seeing. I realized that the women I loved and the one I had moved to Europe for and waited for 13 months to marry after returning from Europe was not performing for me or because of me. When I looked closer, I realized that what I was seeing was her watching a video of a dog performing oral sex on her.  The woman I was to combat animal abuse alongside -- was in fact, an animal abuser."

I also realized that she had a secret life that she had been hiding from me. I felt sick to my stomach when I realized that she had been hiding something so significant. I was not sure what to do, so I waited. I waited for her to come home and I confronted her about what I had found. She denied it and said that I was crazy, that I was just seeing things that were not there. I was shocked and hurt. I told her that I needed time to think and that I would be back in touch with her soon. I did not want to believe what I had found. I wanted to believe that she was the woman I thought she was. But the evidence was right in front of me, and I could not deny it."
