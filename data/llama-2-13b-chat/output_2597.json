        "Summarize the following story in first person: I have always been a strong church goer and I love going to church. The church I love going to is pretty far though. I love the people that go there, so I don't want to switch churches. About 6 months ago, my car broke down and I had to bring it to the shop. It was going to cost $7,000 to fix, so I had to save up the money to fix it. This made it so that I could not get to church without taking the bus since it is so far. It was terrible taking the bus. It was smelly and it took two hours to get to church. So I asked around for someone to give me a ride and the only one who offered was Mike. I don't really like Mike. He is a Republican and is very  vocal about his beliefs. I don't like hearing about them since I don't agree with his views. I feel like he just wants to take me for a ride because he wants to persuade me to follow his political ideals. But, at the same time, it really helps me out and saves time to get a ride with him. Maybe I am overreacting and should just ignore his opinions since it saves me time. I don't really know what to do. I cant wait until I can afford to fix my car! I am really close to saving the money."
