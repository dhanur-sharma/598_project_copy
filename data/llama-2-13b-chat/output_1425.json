        "Summarize the following story in first person: Three months ago I decided to make a trip to Detroit.  This is a city I have always wanted to visit, but have not yet had the opportunity.  My friends recently moved there for work and I thought it would be a great time to visit. It was great getting to catch up with my friends. It had been so long since we last had a chance to visit so it was great!  About a week into my vacation after we had talked ourselves out and had visited a few of the main attractions we decided to take in a sports game.  My friend said that there was an Esports event taking place and that would be a great time to see our favorite team.  I had never been to such an event and to say I was intrigued to say the very least. I had absolutely no idea what to expect but found myself pretty excited as the day grew neigh.  My friend is a sports enthusiast, so this was not his first time to go to an event like this.  The event center was packed and there was quite a lot of activity going on.  We were able to see our favorite team and cheer them on.  Everything was great, though our team was not doing the greatest, they were losing and not losing by a little bit, but by a LOT.  This was a little disappointing, but I was so caught up in the event that even though they were not doing well I was still excited regardless.  When they lost we were sad, a little let down, but all in all I still thought the day went great!  I was excited and spent quality time with my friend. It is a day I will never forget and am so grateful for the experience"
