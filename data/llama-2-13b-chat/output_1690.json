        "Summarize the following story in first person: A couple months ago during summer I was playing basketball in a tournament. We were doing pretty well in the tournament and had already won several game. On me time I had my 2 brothers and one of my cousins playing. We were all having fun and enjoying ourselves. I remember it was like the 3rd or 4th game when something bad happened. The other team missed a shot and someone on my team got the rebound. I started running towards my basket and my teammate threw me the ball. I caught it and took a couple dribbles. Shortly after I caught the ball I noticed someone on the opposite team running towards me. The player was a little taller than me so I knew I had to adjust my shot a bit. I went up for a lay up with my right hand to fake my opponent, then tried to finish with my left. During the shot I had to adjust my body in a weird angle in the air so that I wouldn't get my shot blocked. Because of this I came down really hard on my right knee. I don't know if it was the angle I landed on or what but I felt a huge strain in my knee as soon as I landed. I sat at the rest of the game and had to walk with a limp for the rest of the day. I later on went to the doctor to check it out and found out I ruptured a ligament in my knee. I had to get surgery to repair it and couldn't walk again for a couple of weeks."
