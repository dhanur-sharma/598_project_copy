        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was great being able to catch up with Jen after not seeing much of each other in the last year. The fact that I got to catch up with her while also getting to visit Budapest made it even better. Neither of us have ever been to Hungary before and it was a great bonding experience. Of course there where the expected difficulties communicating with locals and finding our way around an unfamiliar city. But we stuck together and helped each other out. Over all we found the people of Budapest to be friendly and helpful. One of my favorite places was the  Gellert Bath and Spa centre because who doesn't enjoy a spa day.  After several days of site seeing it was nice to relax and enjoy a massage. Of course there where plenty of other things to see. Jen liked the Parliament building .  Being into history we both like Hero's square.  The House of Terror was an interesting look at Hungary's more recent history. We also enjoyed the the local flea market. It was great seeing a little piece of everyday life in Budapest. The Buda Hills also offered a great day away from the city. We enjoyed a nice bike ride along the trails. I lovely picnic was the perfect end to the day."
