        "Summarize the following story in first person: Delta was my spirit animal and canine soul mate. When he got ill with no hope of recovery, I made the difficult but humane decision to have him euthanized. I still grieve for Delta even all these years later and getting another dog was not something I felt I could do. Then, about three months ago, a good friend who works with animal rescue groups called me. She said there was a dog at the public humane society who was in line to be euthanized because he was blind in one eye and wasn't likely to be adopted. He'd already been there for weeks after having been found as a stray. She said he was always passed by and no one showed any interest in adopting a dog with only one eye. One of the rescues she works with wanted to save him but they were already filled to capacity and couldn't do so without a definite forever home for him. Would I be willing to adopt him? She said she'd been to the shelter to see him. She said he was beautiful and full of fun even after having been caged for weeks. She said we would be a perfect match. She sent pictures... and I fell in love. I guess Lucky is aptly named but, truth be told, I am the lucky one. He's a great companion and protector and, although Delta can never be replaced and that hole in my heart can't be filled, Lucky has healed the wound in these three months that we've been together. I know Delta is looking down on us and saying, \"Good job, Lucky!\""
