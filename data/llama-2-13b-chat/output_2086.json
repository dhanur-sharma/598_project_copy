        "Summarize the following story in first person: My twin sister and I have always said that we would have children who were close friends. We implemented \"cousin camp\" this year, where we got together with the 4 cousins and did fun things all together. We went to a science museum, a splash pad, a trampoline park, out to eat, and swimming. The kids (they're all 7 and under) had a great time doing smaller, low-stress \"local\" things. It was fun to bond with my sister. I am still suprised that we are the \"grown ups\"! I love seeing our children bond. I also loved the rare opportunity I had to disconnect from work and just play for a few weeks. On the way home, I stopped with my daughters at a state park after seeing a sign for it at an exit on the interstate. It was a lot longer of a trip off of the interstate than i would have thought, and I almost turned around. But, we went all the way out there, hiked a trail, and then went swimming in the suprisingly awesome pool (with a big slide!). My newly 6 year old daredevil of a daughter was very interested in the slide, so she ran stairs while her sister and I frolicked around. After that, we went to eat pizza at a local place. We hit terrible rush hour traffic on the way home. All of us were all nearly in tears at the length of the trip home (generally 4 hours, but way longer on this occasion)."
