        "Summarize the following story in first person: My nieces first experience at the aquarium was fun. They smiled the entire time and were excited about everything. It started with me and my wife picking up a fan. We then pick up everyone up. Brother, sister in law, mother, and nieces. Drove to Boston and got everyone tickets. They were very excited as we walked through the front doors. Greeted with a huge display of penguins with a speaker telling you all about them. They were quickly drawn to the giant salt water tank in the center of the building. Giant coral in the middle of it with fish swimming in circles. We spent the next few hours walking up the along side it taking it all in. They loved seeing the turtles inside that were 150 years old. We made our way back down looking in on sea horses and jelly fish. All in all it was a fun day for sure. I am sure we will do it again."
