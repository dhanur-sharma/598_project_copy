        "Summarize the following story in first person: It's been a helluva week with getting kicked out of me apartment. I was hoping to move in with a buddy but he ended up getting a roomate of his own and I got kicked outta the mix. Oh well... my landlord has an open apartment that he'll let me move into so phew I don't have to be homeless.. Too bad my girlfriend is leaving me I'm pretty heartbroken.. Hopefully I can find a new girl and live my dreams of becomming a married man. The new apartment is pretty swanky though, I owe my landlord bigtime. Life sometimes just gets in the way, yknow? Can't be mad for long. Welp, see ya nexttime, journals! Hah. So I've written the required amount but cannot submit for some reason, is something wrong? I'll just... Try and. Stretch this out I guess.. How are you? Do you love writing as much as I do? I not read too good though. I hope this is okay holy crap what an assignment. Only one more sentence I think. There we go."
