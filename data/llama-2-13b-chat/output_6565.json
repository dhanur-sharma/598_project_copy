        "Summarize the following story in first person: Dear diary,Two weeks ago today I was in pain myself, I felt depressed and didn't know how I was going to go on. Even though I was hurting I had friends and family who depended on me. I had no other choice but to be strong for everyone else. I had to push my pain aside to help those that I love deal with their pain. It is funny that when I thought I was doing something just for my friends and family I was actually doing something for myself too. Pushing my feelings aside and helping others I was some how able to deal with this pain and tragedy when I thought I couldn't. Allowing myself to think and put someone else first actually helped me to sort my feelings out subconsciously. Sharing someone else's burden may be one of the best decisions I have ever made, it sure helped me to deal with my thoughts and feelings in a more positive way than usual. From now on I vow to always help others no matter what I am going through and maybe sadness will have no control over my life anymore. I can gather comfort in being someone that is strong and able to lift other people i care about up in their times of need. Sometimes caring for others more than yourself is the best thing you can do as a friend and a help. You don't realize I guess until the horrible tragedy calms down or passes that you actually have dealt with it in a positive way and that you have helped someone else in probably the best way you could. I think God designs us that way. I think we are made to be servants of not only him but his people. I think through his purpose that is how we can gain comfort in such a horrible time. Had I not stepped up to help them I would have been at home in bed wallowing in sadness and depression with little comfort. I can proudly say this time diary, I didn't do that. I was the strongest one!"
