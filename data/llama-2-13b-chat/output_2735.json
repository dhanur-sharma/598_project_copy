        "Summarize the following story in first person: The past few months have been so stressful. I love my job but I just keep getting more and more things piled on my plate and it is starting to wear me out. I have always had a passion for organizing events. I was thrilled when I finally interviewed and landed my dream job. I organize events for a huge client in New York City. I deal with celebrities, and giant event spaces. I get to work with nearly unlimited budgets. I am beyond lucky to have this opportunity. However, the stress is unbelievable. I never thought it would be this difficult to get everything working together. So I finally admitted that I needed help, and I was given the budget to hire a team of assistants. That sounds great, right? Not so much. The process of interviewing and hiring a team has been impossible. I feel like it is more stressful than just doing all the work on my own. Everyone I interview is clueless and incompetent. And the few that are slightly qualified want to be paid more money than me! I don't know how I am going to find anyone qualified that I can afford. I know that I need to though. I am not going to be able to keep this job for much longer without some help. My friend suggested looking for someone fresh out of college with no experience, that way I can train them the way I want and they won't have any expectations. I thought that was a bad idea, but at this point I might just try it. I just hope I figure it out soon because the biggest event of the year is coming up !"
