        "Summarize the following story in first person: I still think about the mugging. It's been over a month now yet it is still just as upsetting now as it was then. Every time I'm on the subway I find myself looking around constantly, scanning everyone else up and down. I'm even thinking about what I should do if someone starts approaching me, where can I run to, where is the nearest exit, or is there anything I can just hide behind. Every now and then I see someone who looks like the mugger. It startles me every time. Even if its in broad daylight or in some big store with dozens of other people in it. I know this is insane but I think he may be following me, maybe lying in wait to do it all over again. And this I really hate, I used to have no problem with chatting up people in public, no problem with making new friends, but now I try to avoid it all costs. I just walk around with a hoodie up and headphones in, hoping no one notices me or walks towards me or anything like that.  I'm pretty much running when in public just so some other mugger will have less of a chance to exploit me. I haven't worn what I was wearing that night again. Not even the shoes. I should probably just throw all that clothing away, even seeing it sitting in the corner of the room is too much. It just brings up those memories all over that run and run like a video stuck on repeat. I'm not sure if I should donate it to goodwill or something - I don't know why I find myself thinking like this, but it's almost like everything to do with that night is tainted. Why should I give something that's been ruined like that to someone in need? I'm actually thinking of moving out of the city now. If something like this happens again I just couldn't handle it. I can barely handle it now. Things weren't all that stressful before the mugging, but now I'm almost having panic attacks just putting on my coat and tying my shoes. Everyone has noticed that I'm not going out anymore. Everyone at work can see that I'm almost falling apart. And I just can't stand going to work, climbing down the stairs at that same station. It doesn't matter what time it is, even when there are a hundred people on the platform."
