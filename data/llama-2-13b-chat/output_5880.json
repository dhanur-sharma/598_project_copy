        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was very proud of successfully launching a company that I started for the first time. I was surprised that it worked because of the difficulties that I faced along the way. However, the most unexpected event that I encountered was meeting a friend who helped me through the best times. Today I call that friend my best friend. When I was looking for people to start a business with, I started searching for programmers at local colleges to help me launch my idea. I met someone from a local college, and at the time he was a stranger to me. At first, I did not necessarily like the guy I ended up starting a business with, and I did not know if we would be able to work together, but he finished a protype of our application and I liked it. What I learned about my new friend was that his work-ethic is second to none, and that is something I respect. Most importantly, I learned that my friend maintains a positive attitude, and that is what helped us through the process of creating a company. Without my friends positivity, we would have never launched our company, and he would not be someone I call my best friend. When I started the company, I had no idea that I would make a new friend, and it was a complete shock to me to meet someone like him. We hangout outside of work these days, go to games together, go to events together, and we hang out with each other\u2019s families. I learned that tasks are always easier when you do them with people you like being around. I also learned that difficult tasks can be made possible when you perform them with people who are positive. The process of starting a company is significant to me because I did something that no one thought I could do, I get to do something that I love, and I get to do it with a new best friend."
