        "Summarize the following story in first person: Two months ago, I clocked one year at my current place of work and it was time for my first appraisal. Usually, the company I work with carry out performance appraisals every year and based on the results, the company could decide to confirm your appointment, or offer you a promotion. A few weeks after I clocked one year, I was summoned by HR for my appraisal and I began to get really nervous. I was to appear before a panel the next Monday to answer some questions and review my performance over the last 12 months. I was dressed up and ready to go. Just as I was walking to the conference room, A colleague mistakenly spilled his coffee on my shirt. I was devastated as I was specifically advised to appear as smart and neat as possible before the panel. I had no time to go home to change so I had to walk in that way. I was so tensed up. The first question I was asked was why I looked so tacky. I explained that few minutes ago, a colleague spilled his coffee on my shirt and there was no time to go and change my shirt. The members of the panel laughed and told me the session was not going to take more than 3 minutes. They said they had noticed my work ethic and just had to summon me for formality sake. They made positive remarks about my performance and told me to check my mail box for a break down of my scores. They then handed me a letter of confirmation which also contained information about an upward review of my salary as a confirmed member of staff. That was it. I came out as the happiest tacky looking fellow in the world."
