        "Summarize the following story in first person: I have no relationship with my parents because they are radically religious, and when I was 18 they discovered that I, their daughter, was a lesbian, and since they've wanted nothing to do with me. It's been about 9 years, as i'm 27 now. One thing I have always feared was the day one of my grandparents would die and it would force us to all be at a funeral together after not seeing them in so long. That fear finally became a reality in June of this year. My grandfather's funeral was a time to honor him and his life, and in my mind I was willing to set everything with my parents to just all be together as a family for this hard time. I didn't know how my parents would react. I thought it could go one of two ways. Either they would absolutely be infuriated by my showing up with my significant other and possibly start a scene at the funeral, or this death would soften their hearts and make them see the wrong in their behavior and that it could possibly start a rekindling in our relationship. I always had secretly hoped that the latter would be the result, unfortunately this was not the case. The night of the wake, the day before the funeral, I saw my parents and tried to briefly greet them and make small talk, even though it was incredibly awkward and uncomfortable. They seemed very sad, but quiet and it seemed as though they weren't going to cause any problems. Then, within an hour of leaving the wake that night me and my phone was lit up with messages and voicemails about how I dare not bring my significant other to the funeral tomorrow and that they were making conference calls with other family members trying to get her name removed from the obituary, as it was such a horrible sin and everyone should be ashamed for putting it on paper. It was not removed and I did bring her to the service with me. As a result, my mother thought it so horrible that she couldn't even bring herself to show up. This was the most shocking thing to me. I knew she was upset, but not attending her own father in law's funeral who she loved and had a good relationship with for nearly 40 years, it's just a whole new low for her. My father showed up, but kept a wide distance the entire time and would never directly look at me. It was hard not to be upset by this, but as time has passed and I've had a little distance from the situation I realized it's not anger or resentment I feel toward my parents anymore. Its pity. Pity for the fact that they've isolated themselves and hurt their relationships with so many family members. I think about how sad it must be and how alone they must feel at times. I'll always still love them from afar and hope something sparks a change of heart. I don't want them to live out the rest of their lives this way."
