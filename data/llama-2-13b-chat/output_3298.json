        "Summarize the following story in first person: I have a blood disorder that sends me to the E.R. numerous times a year. I have been hospitalized for every holiday this past year. No one knows , no doctor or specialist I go to knows what it is. It's very scary . My first E.R visit was two weeks . I was brought in by my very good friend. For weeks I told him I wasn't feeling to well . My vision also was being impaired. He came to visit and while I was putting on my jeans I fainted with my eyes open .He drove me to the hospital instead of waiting for the ambulance. Good thing though once at the hospital they said another fifteen minutes and I would have been dead. I was given my first blood transfusion. Since then I have never been completely healthy. Fast forward to a few months ago I was fasting . I was to break my fast so I went shopping for chicken broth & vegetables. I had to sit down before I walked back home I was so dizzy & weak. It was extremely hot to add. I sat for maybe two hours then I fainted again ambulance was called and the process started all over again. I'm absolutely terrified of this episode happening and I'm completely alone & vulnerable. I'm also worried about my vison and what this means to my quality of life?"
