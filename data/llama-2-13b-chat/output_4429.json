        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 2 weeks ago I had hear breaking encounter on the freeway. No, I was not in a car accident. It was the weekend and I was taking a drive up north to visit my family. We planned this get together a few weeks before. We were going to visit a few breweries for my father's birthday. He's been collecting beer signs for as long as I can remember so he loves this stuff. Anyway, I got in my car and headed for the freeway. Started out like any other time I'd taken the drive. After about 10 minutes I noticed something odd up ahead. A dog was wondering out by the median! It was a small dog and seemed pretty scared. I attempted to safely stop on the side of the road, but traffic was pretty heavy since it was fourth of July weekend. I eventually was able to stop, but I looked back and noticed the dog laying in the middle of the highway. I could see another car stopped and the driver was stooped over the dog with his hand covering his face. The poor dog had been hit by a car. At this point I was too upset to get any closer. I got back in my car and drove away. Was a sad start to what would be an otherwise great day."
