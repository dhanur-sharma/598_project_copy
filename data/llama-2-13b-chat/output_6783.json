        "Summarize the following story in first person: The happiest day of my life our tour to Ooty. We went for a trip to the beautiful hill station last month. It was a nice family trip where we enjoyed a lot. The trip started on a breezy Sunday morning. We hired a van from our home and my uncle\u2019s family accompanied us. We boarded a lodge at 10 \u2018o clock in the morning and the weather so cold that we were freezing like a statue. After getting ready with all our jackets over us we went to the Thunder world which was a very different theme zone I have ever seen. \u00a0The botanical garden and rose garden were so amazing. It was a great scene to see so many flowers all together. They all looked as if they were smiling at us. The next day we visited Pykara and the boating experience there, was indeed not equivalent to words. The same afternoon we went to Mudhumalai forests and saw wildlife face to face. The trip was so wonderful that it cannot be explained simply in words. The trip to Ooty was definitely one of the most memorable ones in my life. Today my tenth board exam results have been declared. Until 2'o clock, my heart was beating very fast. As soon as I saw my result I felt that I was on the top of this world. I have come first in my school. Everyone was very happy after they came to know my results. My parents were so happy that they ordered lots of sweets and distributed in our neighborhood. I was at the top of the world after I came to know that I was the topper of my school. I will always remember this day as it was one of the best days of my life.  I was away on a long weekend with a group of my best friends, sitting around, drinking and having fun when something struck me. I wondered how this had happened? \u200bThe most healthy person in the room had recently completed an Iron\u200b \u200bMan triathlon, so I had a pretty high benchmark to \u200bmeet.  Fast forward a few years\u200b and \u200bI have completed 30+ marathons\u200b and \u200bultra marathons and I think I did just fine.- Daniel Da Vinci   I was sitting in my room with some friends when I got a call from my dad's number.

It was such a surreal moment, like a dream come true. I had been applying for that job for months and had almost given up hope. But now, here I was, being offered the position. I couldn't believe it. My dad told me to come home as soon as possible to discuss the details and sign the contract. I hung up the phone and just sat there for a few minutes, trying to process everything. I was so happy and relieved that I had finally gotten the job. I knew that this was the start of a new chapter in my life and I was excited to see where it would take me."
