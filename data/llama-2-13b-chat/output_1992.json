        "Summarize the following story in first person: A recent event that has been memorable and touching to me was going to Beijing, China with my family for the 2nd time but going to the main landmarks for the first time. I grew up in China but moved to the United States 10 years ago and this was my 3rd time back there since I moved with my child. I haven't seen my mom in 3 years nor my sister, and they are very important people in my life so it was hard to not see them for so long. Only my sister, child, boyfriend, and other family members went to Beijing though so my mom wasn't able to come along due to her health and age which was sad. It was memorable to go to Beijing though because we had a tour guide and our first stop was Tiananmen Square and it was incredible to see it in real life as I always saw it in movies or TV shows that I have watched. There were so many people there but I had a good time walking around, seeing the Forbidden City behind it as well. Our tour guide did a good job of explaining the history behind the Forbidden City and it was interesting to learn about everything. There were clocks donated by other countries displayed and that was one of my favorite things to see. The day after we went to Tiananmen Square again getting up at 3 am in the morning to see the flag rise and soldiers to walk out. There were surprisingly a lot of people there at that time too, with everyone trying to take a video of it. We also went to the museum and various palaces the same day. The day after that, we were able to go to the Great Wall of China which was a once in a lifetime experience. We took a cable car up to the Great Wall and we didn't walk too much, we just mainly admired the scenery and the beauty of it all. The history behind the Great Wall is fascinating and I can't imagine how many people poured their life into building the Wall. Overall, my trip to Beijing was the most memorable trip that I have had and a truly touching experience."
