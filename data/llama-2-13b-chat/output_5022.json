        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 4 months ago in preparation for mothers day my Sons school had them do poem cards for the holiday. I was unaware he was so keen to what is going on in my personal life. His father passed away about a year and a half ago and it has been really rough on me. I try to hide this from him but I guess he picked up on it. The poem he wrote seemed to be in the style of dr seuss. Part of my suspicion is confirmed by the fact that the picture on the front shows both of us in a tall striped hat. The poem read as this. \"Sometimes mom cries, and thats okay, because I love her on mothers day. Shes a good mom and makes me food, shes a girl but a real cool dude.\" I was shocked to know that he sees me crying or is at at least aware of it. It made me re think how i show my emotions and my abilities as a mother. I want to show him i am strong but feel so weak. I very much wish he had a good male role model. My father passed away long ago, and my husbands family lives across the country. I need guidance but dont know where to look. I'm thankful for my son, and all he does to keep me going, but I worry I might not be doing enough."
