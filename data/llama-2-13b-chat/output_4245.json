        "Summarize the following story in first person: The first day of spring was the day my twins were born. I went in for a routine OB visit and it was determined we would be induced that day instead of waiting for them to arrive on their own. The induction went well and the babies arrived healthy. The whole hosptial knew of them by the time we left. Everything in my life has been so different since they arrived. I eat cold meals and rarely sleep more than 2 hours at a time.  I have never had to talk to as many strangers as I do when I am out and about with twin babies. It has forced me to learn how to be more comfortable with speaking to people I dont know. I find that the more I do this the easier it is. I am also learning how to better just go with the flow of life, rather than always needing a to do list and a plan. The have brought so much joy in my life. And even though I have not had a decent nights sleep since they were born I am in the best place mentally that I have been in a long time. It amazes me every day how ok I am with just letting things go. Things that used to matter, like my to do list and sparkly clean home, no longer matter as much. I find what matters is being present with my children and bettering our lives for experiences rather than things."
