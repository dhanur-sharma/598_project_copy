        "Summarize the following story in first person: The trip to Colorado actually worked in my favor in a lot of aspects of life. My brother and his family had just recently moved to Colorado and I was lucky to stay with them for a week in the summer. During this week I was able to go to the music venue Red Rocks. I have wanted to visit this place for years. I was lucky enough to see my all-time favorite band and a more current band I have grown to like at the venue during this week in Colorado. So I was lucky and got to visit with family, see two amazing music acts and visit a beautiful part of our country. I was in awe of the scenery. This was actually the highlight of the trip. I was moved by the experience and plan on moving to Colorado in the near future. I have began making plans with my brother to become a resident. I went to Colorado to watch a concert and left in love, with a new vision for retirement. This is substantial to me. I have never really had a good plan. This trip and visit has made a plan for me. I will visit there annually until I live there. I am grateful for this trip."
