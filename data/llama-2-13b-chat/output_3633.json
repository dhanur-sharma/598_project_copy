        "Summarize the following story in first person: Sometimes when you lose someone, the best way to find them is in the happy memories. The smell of the local bbq place immediately brought me back to the time we were having lunch and the extra sauce flung of the table and covered everyone.  The sight of our favorite secret creek, makes it feel like my dad was here. I miss him so much and want nothing more than a hug. The reality has set in that I can no more. So trips back to my roots, bring me as close as I can get.  When the Kentucky sun shines on my face, I feel peace. The happy memories loft in and I am content that I have them. Occasionally a tear catches my eye, when I think about the fact no more memories can be made. The moments of sadness quickly pass, when another recollection of your laugh floods my memory.  The loss of a parent is hard, but trips back through history help.  Soon a trip down our favorite trail will chase the sad feelings away.  Going forward with the new, while remembering the past is the best way for time to pass. Kentucky time seems pass slower than I'm used to. Its the perfect setting for a trip of memories.  Nostalgia sets in with the sunset  and peace follows suit."
