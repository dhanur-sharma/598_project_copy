        "Summarize the following story in first person: My sister moved out the the southwest because she wanted to find work there.   She was preparing to drive the whole way there with a friend.  I did a few things to help her move, like helping to take care of her cats.  I really enjoyed that part because I like getting to be around animals.  I also helped move some of the boxes of her stuff to her car so she could drive cross country with it all.  Some other family members were around and helping out too.  I am not very close with my sister so it felt weird and awkward hanging out with her helping her move.  She was more polite and thankful to me than I thought she was going to be, which was nice.   My mother was really upset that she was moving away because she was pretty close to my sister.  I think my dad was happy that she was finding a place of her own.   It was weird seeing my mom cry about her leaving.  I think it was extra hard for her because it is so far away.  My parents also bought a bunch of stuff for her new place.  Her friend who was helping her move was vegan and my mom freaked out about finding the right kind of food for her.  After she left my parents were sort of sad for a while, but they got better when she moved into her new place for real."
