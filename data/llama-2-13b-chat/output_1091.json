        "Summarize the following story in first person: This was the day we would release her ashes as requested. I was so sad. I was relieved the weather was overcast. It seemed solemn like our moods. We walked to beach with small bag of ashes we wanted to release to the waves. E had been to this beach many years ago. It was place that she loved and it only seemed right to bring her back. I still can't believe she is gone. Selfishly, I wondered how horrible it was going to be for me to be left behind. We had spoken through email several times a week for the past 3 years. And for me I felt closer to her now than I had when we were kids. The sadness is mostly all the things that can not share now but I am also so grateful for all that we could share. Thankful for the time that we recovered. Thankful that we had reconnected and could comfort and share moments that bring meaning to life. We had planned to be together, those of us that were left behind and remember. We wanted to celebrate her time with us and let her know how fortunate we were to known her.  And so we chose the holiday and the beach to release her ashes. The beach that day was beautiful.  So many shades of gray across the water and sky. I wanted to tell her how beautiful it was. I spoke to her in my head and I told her how I would miss her and let her know she would always be remembered. I knelt down and dug a small hollow in the sand and waited for the surf to come. It was time to let her go. Send her into the surf and begin moving forward without her."
