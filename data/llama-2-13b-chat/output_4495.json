        "Summarize the following story in first person: That weekend was a super frantic one. At first we really didn't think we needed to be worried and then with every passing hour, things got more intense. So, I had to wake up early and get my kids dressed and ready. I had to take a ride sharing car to the grocery store and i had to go in along side all of the zombies trying to find food to last should the hurricane hit and we lose power. It was awful because the store was packed, the lines were long and there was no water left. There was hardly anything substanial at that point. After that, I went to the liqour store to buy some rum. The hurricane did not end up hitting us at all. It was a fluke and every one was panic and filling gas and spending money and we did not get hit. I am so grateful that we did not get hit but i am also so over whelmed thinking about the ordeal that was. Now, i still have food that remains from that weekend. Still in the cabinets, untouched. It was better to be safe than sorry and be prepared just in case. It was better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have. In case things did go sour and we lost power, i'm glad that it all worked out and things were not ant worse."
