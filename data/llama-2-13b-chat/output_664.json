        "Summarize the following story in first person: A large group of friends and myself got together for a barbecue. It is rare that we can all get together at the same time. We usually can only get together in small bunches with one to three of us missing so it is a great time when we all can get together. We went to one of our friends houses and hung out in their back yard next to their pool. We spent most of the time talking and playing a few board or card games, just catching up. It was overall sunny and good weather outside, a little hotter than some of use like. The friend whose house it was bought hamburger, hot dogs, sausage and chicken to cook on their grill. A few of use also brought a lot of other food and things with them. Some brought soda, drinks and ice others brought side dishes. I brought a few things and made a dessert. We ended up spending most of the day and part of the night together and went home close to 11 that night. It was a good time and fun catching up with everyone together. A lot of us made plans for the next meet up since some of use enjoy different hobbies than others. Myself and a group made plans to go hiking the following weekend. We also made a few plans to meet up for lunch and play games during the week."
