        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 4 months ago, I got into a really bad accident while riding my mountain bike during a solo trip to the smoky mountains. Thankfully, a nearby hiker heard my cries for help and carried me to the nearest medical center. I got helicoptered to a local hospital and found out I had a broken my left leg and also torn my meniscus. I was so heartbroken when the doctor told me I would need extensive physical therapy before I could return to biking. By the time I had gotten the diagnosis, my best friend had shown up and was there to comfort me. She promised she would help me every step of the way with recovering. At first, when I had been discharged and brought back to my city, I was so discouraged. Even standing up was a grueling experience and physical therapy was one of the most painful things I had ever gone through. I was ready to give up everyday, but my best friend always sent me motivational texts, accompanied me to therapy, and pushed me to do the exercises on my own day after day. Though I was struggling, I can't say I ever felt alone because of her. It has now been a little over 4 months since the incident and I just got back from my follow-up appointment. The doctor said my recovery is one of the fastest he has ever seen and I should be back on my bike by the beginning of next year! My best friend was right there beside me to hear the news and she told me how proud she was of me. I felt really emotional. I couldn't have done this without her and I can't wait to see what happens next."
