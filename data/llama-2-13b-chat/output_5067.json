        "Summarize the following story in first person: When I was driving that Saturday in the parking lot and saw the shelter's dog set up I just decided to stop and look.  I didn't have any exact thoughts about an animal nor did I really have an inclination that I really wanted an animal that day.  As I was getting out of the car I noticed the set up and they had some of the animals in a trailer and some of the larger dogs outside on the grass in a small fenced in area.  The larger dogs outside seemed to be having a good time barking at cars and the others milling about.  As I was looking one dog in particular just looked sad.  I walked up to the fence area and she just looked up at me and didn't make much a fuss that I was even there.  I picked up her card and his name was Mop and he was 3 years old and the card stated he was owner surrender because his owners went into a nursing home.  How sad I thought as I walked off and kept looking around at all the animals.  As I was making my rounds my eye continued to go back Mop.  As I walked back to where Mop sat I decided that he was coming home with me. I did the paperwork and Mop and I went to the pet store to get what he was going to need to live with me.  As we walked around the store Mop didn't seem interested at all.  When we got home I showed him his new bed and toys.  He laied down on his bed immediately and started rolling all around.  He seemed potty trained and indicated at the door when he wanted to go out.  The first day I just pretty much followed him around and making sure he knew where everything was and telling him no when he was looking at something I didn't want him to be messing with.  The first night (and every night since) Mop has slept at the end of my bed during the night with no issues.  The impact has been amazing because Mop has just become a part of my everyday life."
