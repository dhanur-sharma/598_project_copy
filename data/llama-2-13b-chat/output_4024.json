        "Summarize the following story in first person: A few months ago I helped my son move into his first apartment. It was time for him to go to college and it was too far away for him to commute from home. While I am very proud of him being accepted to such a prestigious institution, I am sad to see him go. He has asked me to help him pack some of his belongings which really made it hit home that he was really leaving. He decided he did not want to keep many of his posessions. His dog will be staying with us since his apartment does not allow pets. He is getting rid of many of his older toys, books, and some momentos from his years from high school. I can only hope that he will not party too much. He needs to focus on his school work. Who knows, maybe he will find his soul mate while he is there as well! So far I haven't heard from him yet. I do not want to call him to rain on his parade, but I cannot help but worry. Soon he will be visiting while he is on spring break. I intend to find out as much as I can about how things are going for him while he is here! If he doesn't answer maybe I can ask some of his friends."
