        "Summarize the following story in first person: One event that was memorable to me was my best friends 25th birthday. She is such a hard worker and great person that I wanted to make sure that her birthday was extra special. Her boyfriend  reached  out to me to make sure we coordinated bringing the balloons and cake. She wanted to do a brunch with a few friends. Plus the place she picked had a really good menu.  I was able to suprise her with a big dessert that had sparklers and seeing the suprise and happiness on her face made it all worth it. I had never before had the confidence or opportunity to be able to to suprise a friend on his or her birthday. I was very happy that I was finally able to. Someone was able to get a picture perfectly capturing the moment. I know the friendship that we share shows throughout the entire event. And it was a different experience that we all had. Even though 3 of the people we went with were almost denied entrance. Thankfully my friends boyfriend spoke with the bouncer and worked something out. I almost got lost getting there but thankfully Google maps helped me out. I am confident to say regardless all of it she had a great day."
