        "Summarize the following story in first person: Well, I am 34 year old man. I had been in a relationship with a woman for 17 months. I was completely in love with her. Given my age, how long we were together, and how much I enjoyed her, I was thinking about proposing. I've never met anyone else in my life that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. However, she decided to end our relationship. We were living together for the past 6 months. She came home from work like every other ordinary day and told me she wanted to talk to me. She told me she didn't see a future with me anymore. I was completely blindsided. I initially felt shock then panicked and tried to talk her out of it. I was quite emotional and she remained calm. She left and told me she would come back on the weekend to gather all her things. Not a day has gone by since that I haven't thought about it. It was emotionally devastating when it happened. Nothing much has changed since."
