At an after party, we hooked up with many people. At some point I was talking with a guy. We started to make out, and it was great. I enjoyed it very much. It was so good, I had to reconsider my life choices. Especially my relationship with my boyfriend. Was it really worth it? Perhaps I could do better, I thought. However, I quickly cam back to my senses. I got myself together and left. I went back home to my boyfriend. I did not tell him. However, I was happy to be back home in bed."
