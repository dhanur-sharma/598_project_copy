        "Summarize the following story in first person: 4 months ago, I was dating a guy named Brian DeFranco. At first I thought he was everything that I always wanted in a man. Not only did he work a full time job but he also helped around the house, treated me and my daughter like royalty, and was faithful. He had mentioned numerous times throughout our relationship that he had a rough past, but never did either of us imagine that it would catch up to him like it did in the most embarrassing way possible. One weekend, me, Brian, and my daughter Diamond were all eating breakfast when suddenly there was a loud banging on the door. \"Open up this is the police!\" a man cried.This startled me, but Brian seemed unfazed as he quickly and quietly got up from the table and started to make his way towards the bedroom. I asked him where he was going but he wouldn't tell me. All he said was to act like he had been missing for days to save myself. I watched in horror as opened the window and climbed out without uttering another word as the police continued to knock. \"Hold on, I'm coming!\" I said, closing the window and leaving the bedroom to walk to the main door. My daughter was in tears. \"Where did Brian go?\" she wailed. I shushed her, composed myself, and opened the door. As soon as I did, five police officers swarmed in and they went about raiding my entire apartment. \"Excuse me. What is going on?\" I said. One of the police officers told me that they were looking for my boyfriend as apparently he had murdered his father. I did my best to remain calm. \"He asked if I had seen him around lately. I lied and told him no and that it had been a few days. \"He's not here so please leave, you all are scaring my daughter.\" After they'd finished searching, the police all gathered around in my living room. They asked me more questions about Brian and then they left, saying that they'd let me know when they found him. I remember crying for hours after the'd left and wondering things went so wrong so fast? Days later, I received a call that they did find Brian in another state and he was in police custody. He's now sitting in jail where he'll remain for 30 years without parole for manslaughter of his father William DeFranco."
