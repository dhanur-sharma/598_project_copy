        "Summarize the following story in first person: Ms. Kitty died and it is horrible shame and I seriously miss her every single day. I miss her sitting in my lap getting pets and snuggling into my arms. I miss her trying to sit on my keyboard while I'm trying to work. In short, I miss her more and more every day. When I feel really bad, I head down to the river to visit where we buried her. I talk to her, and tell her about my day.  It makes me feel more comfortable to talk to her like I used to do. I decided that when I die, I want to be cremated. Not only that, I want my ashes to be interred near the spot where my cat is buried by the river. It is a great comfort to feel that she would be near me for all eternity. I can't think of a better way to hold her memory in my mind than this. Those who know me will probably find this silly. But it doesn't matter what they think. All that matters is how I feel about it."
