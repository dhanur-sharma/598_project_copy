        "Summarize the following story in first person: Earlier this summer, my neighbor---who I have known my entire life of 34 years---suddenly passed away. At first, I was very shocked. I had just sat down with her around my birthday, and while she mentioned having back pain, she was still sharp as a knife and not sick. I have lived in this house forever (as I inherited it from my parents when they passed away, back when I was in college). I grew up knowing this neighbor. I viewed her as part of my extended family. She would always walk her adorable Yorkie dog down the street, and if I were outside, she would stop to talk to me about the day. When I learned of her passing, I decided to attend her funeral. Her funeral was on a Thursday. I asked my in-laws if they would watch my son, who is only six. He cared a lot for our neighbor, too, but he is so young he doesn't quite understand the concept of mortality yet. I didn't want to expose him to her if her casket was open. (It was.)At the funeral, I talked to other neighbors who were equally upset and sad. I hugged her family. I watched a slideshow of photos that also showed her husband, who had passed away earlier. I liked him, too. Now her children are planning to sell her house, and I'm a little nervous. I've never had a new neighbor so close before."
