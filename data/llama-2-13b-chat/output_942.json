        "Summarize the following story in first person: More than 7 months ago, my wife gave birth to our first child, a baby girl named Mariella.  I knew that having a child was a life changing experience from the start, but I had no clue just how different things would be.  Honestly, I thought that the first couple of months would be a grind trying to develop routines and sleep patterns and just learning how to be a parent, but I thought that I would return to a normal life soon after.  That could not be further from the truth. I hardly ever seen my friends or do personal activities outside of the home anymore.  One reason for this is simple fatigue.  Mariella slept better than most babies for the first five months of her life, but she has regressed significantly and I'm exhausted much of the time.  I also just really value being with her and only get to spend about 90 minutes with her each night before her theoretical bedtime. There is no time to go to happy hour or the movies or dinner with a friend if I want to spend quality time with my daughter on the weeknights.  And my baby girl loves nothing more than being in the same room with her parents, and that's meaningful to me and I want to be there for her. The entire experience of being a father has truly been special.  Every decision I make is viewed through a lens of how it will affect her.  It's fascinating how you can develop such a deep connection with someone you've known for less than a year and who can't even communicate verbally.  It's special because of the changes I'm seeing in her every day like learning how to sit up on her own and because of the changes soon to come.  I'm excited in this very moment thinking about the prospect of her crawling and starting to talk to soon.  She hasn't yet met my immediate family because they live so far away, so meeting them toward the end of 2020 will be a major highlight."
