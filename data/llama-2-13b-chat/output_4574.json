        "Summarize the following story in first person: That trip was so fun!  Not only did i get to meet new people that i was sure i would like, I got to see new places.  We talked so much online that we felt like we knew each other already, so it was really fun to meet up face to face and do things together.  I am sure we will stay in touch for a long time.  I sure hope we do.  One friend in particular and i really hit it off.  It was like we were long lost sisters or something and had finally reunited after many years.  We plan to get together again, without the entire group.  Im sue we will get together as a group again, but we two want to pursue our relationship further for sure. I think next time she will come see where i live.  Now that i got to see her stomping grounds so to speak, she can see mine.  She lives in a big city with lots and lots to do constantly.  I live in a much smaller city, but its right on the water so we will have quite a variety of different things to do.  She has never been kayaking, so that will definitely be on the to do list.  I sure am looking forward to our next get together!"
