        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was in an abusive relationship with a guy. One experience was when he came home late one night drunk, with his best friend. He comes in, slurring his words. I got out of my bed to see what was the problem. He and his friend were in the bathroom. As I walked into the bathroom, I prepared myself for the worst. Blood. There was so much blood in my bathtub. There were drops on the floor, too. I was thankful there wasn't any blood on the carpets in the living room. I was, after all, renting this unit. He tells me he punched his best friend int he nose and he broke it. I was in shock from seeing all of the blood, I didn't know how to react. He had a temper and did not have control over it when he was sober. Seeing the blood, a wave of memories washed over me. When he kept punching my room door to let him inside. He had made a hole into it. When he grabbed my face and shoved me into a wall. When he yelled so much at me, he was spitting. His friend accepted his apology and didn't even get angry and retaliate. He was a terrible friend. A terrible lover as well. I guess he got a good look at himself when he saw my face and all of the blood that he caused to shed. Shortly after, I had to clean the tub. It was almost time for work."
