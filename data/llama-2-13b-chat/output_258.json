        "Summarize the following story in first person: While her friends seemed amicable I got a strange vibe from them.  Trying to be friendly I asked where in Africa they were going.  They gave me a strange look, said something in foreign language and left.  I paid it no mind and shut the door.  I continued to see my neighbor sporadically throughout the weeks and things were friendly.  I stopped my exercise routine and joined a gym.  My apartment is much to small for exercising anyway.  One day while in the elevator I saw my neighbor and asked how her friends' trip was.  She said they were still there but should be back soon.  The elevator door then opened and I stepped out and wished her good day.  Two weeks later there was a knock on my door.  It was my downstairs neighbor accompanied by her two friends from before.  I greeted them and asked if I was being too loud.  I had recently been cleaning and my music and horrible singing were a little loud.  They said no so I asked if they wanted to come in.  As they came in I noticed what looked to be a large box in the hall.  I asked what's in the box?  They replied \"you're new pet'  Confused I opened the box to find a cage with a beautiful parrot."

I had no idea how to care for a parrot and I had no idea why they gave me this pet.  I was also a little annoyed that they just dropped off a pet and left without any instructions.  I decided to call my friend to ask for advice on how to care for the parrot.  She suggested I take the parrot to the vet to get checked out first.  I agreed and took the parrot to the vet.  The vet said the parrot was healthy but suggested I get a larger cage and some toys for the parrot.  I followed the vet's advice and got a larger cage and some toys.  I also started researching how to care for a parrot and learned a lot.  I was able to keep the parrot happy and healthy and we became great friends.  I was also grateful for the unexpected gift of the parrot and the new responsibilities that came with it.\n\n"
