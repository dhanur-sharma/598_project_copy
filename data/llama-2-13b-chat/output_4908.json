        "Summarize the following story in first person: My personal life story begins like all of us at my birth. Being born in a small village in the West African country of Ghana gives me my uniqueness and an identity that has culture, history and politics in it. The village is called Dixcove after the British Captain who was called Captain Dixon who colonised the region in the 16th Century. My Mother is a Ghanaian and my Farther is from England, the North West a West Cumbrian. When I was four it was decided by my parents that I would live in England with my dad\u2019s sister my Auntie Dot. \u2018It was for the best reasons\u2019 I have remembered my Auntie saying and after all it was the brave new world of the nineteen sixties, where the \u2018civil rights\u2019 movement was in its ascendency. Being sent to live in Egremount in West Cumbria had a number of challenges, not just for its white working class identity which served up a lot of prejudice for me; it was also the beginning of the sexual abuse that I had to endure as a child. My Auntie had two Sons and one Daughter. This was my home and where I lived with them, my cousins, my Auntie and my Uncles. From the age of seven up until the age of ten I was sexually abused by one of the boys on a weekly basis, apart from a three month period in each year. I was forced to act out sexual favours for him. He was eighteen at the time and the abuse would always happen in mine and my dad\u2019s room. This is mentioned for the reason of if I was reading this I may ask \u2018where was my dad when this was happening? Dads are supposed to protect you aren\u2019t they?\u2019 He lived in Ghana working and living with my Mum where he would spend nine months in Ghana and three months in England. As a black child, young adult who had no black friends, no black family members or black role models there has been a visible lack of \u2018group identity\u2019. My contact with blackness was watching Muhammad Ali win the heavy weight championship of the world, the Jackson Five singing ABC and the Brazilin footballer Pele being my school nickname given to me by my white peers. Having to live with experiencing sexual abuse has had a huge effect on me; anger, depression and anxiety have been emotions which were hard for me to live with but easy for me to relate to. Even so the sexual abuse had not affected the real sense of \u2018uniqueness\u2019 my situation gave me. It did not matter that there was a lack of blackness in my world to relate to, both subtle and overate messages every day gave negative, positive assurance of my sense of self, I felt black, it was certainly not the case of being proud of this fact after all I had been sexual abused as a child. Self-image has direct long term impact on self-esteem and is vital in helping a healthy development. When my cousin who sexual abused me told me \u2018if I spoke to anyone about the sexual abuse no one would believe me because I was an outsider, a brown bugger no one wanted\u2019 his words stopped me from saying anything to anyone."

I was a black waiter in a white town, I felt like an outsider, I was a brown bugger, I was the brown bugger that no one wanted. The only thing that mattered was my job and my wages. When I was twenty one I moved to London and started a new life. I was now living with my partner and my two children. I started working as a counselor and I was helping people to overcome their addictions and depression. I had finally found my voice. I had found my place in the world. I had found my sense of purpose. I was proud to be who I was, a black man who had survived sexual abuse as a child and had gone on to make a difference in the world. I was proud of my uniqueness."
