My grandson had just been born when I \"died\" and have been spending time with him. Then my granddaughter came just after that.  Want to take them a lot and keep them with me but I don't trust myself being alone with them.  It is the picking them up and crrying them around that is hard.  I can't always pick them up and hold them.  I get very tired and have to rest a lot.  I also have issues remembering some things at times.  I forget more often and have to work to remember stuff.  I also get more frustrated with the kids than I did when my oldes granddaughter was born.  It is all very frustrating to me and just want to feel normal.  I also want to be able to drive but my son refuses to let me drive in case something happens.  I almost hit a guy on a bicycle one time.  My son just laughed but it really bothered him.  I didn't feel I was too close but he did."
