        "Summarize the following story in first person: We went on vacation to Colorado in July of this year.  We drove there in a car with my family and spent two weeks there. On our way back home to Texas we stopped in a town we never have been to before. It was a small mountain town with a alot of small quirky stores. We got out of the car to go pick up a gift at one of the shops for a family member. As we were walking around we came by a very old arcade. This arcade was huge and had tons of really old machines that I have never seen before. My kids and spent the whole afternoon playing games in this arcade. We had a blast. We walked around some more and found a great restaurant to eat at. We sat at a table on a patio right next to the river. I had a huge burger and it was delicious. After that we walked around some more and found a few really unique stores to buy some cool items and gifts. Before we realized, it started to get dark. We weren't planning to stay another night, but ended up unexpectedly staying at a hotel in that town."
