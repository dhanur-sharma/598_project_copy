        "Summarize the following story in first person: 12 weeks ago I had to visit the hospital for my severe headaches. I had eaten some oatmeal for breakfast and then gone to the park to play with John. I felt a bit queasy during the game and felt a mild headache start to appear but I just powered through. For lunch I had spaghetti and meatballs and watched leave it to beaver with my parents. I had a few more headaches after lunch leading up to supper time. During the preparation for supper I had helped my mother with the food but felt a headache so severe that I had to drop everything and curl into a ball for several minutes until it subsided. I had been getting headaches all day long ranging from mild to severe.  I had no idea what was going on but I had a gut feeling something was wrong in my head. I went to the hospital to get a diagnosis with my friend Belle. Once I arrived the secretary told me I had to wait 2-3 hours to be seen. Approximately 5 hours later I was seen by a doctor and he suggested we do an extended EEG to analyze brain wave activity and see if there was anything abnormal. The process took no more than 15 minutes and then the doctor told me that he did indeed see some abnormal activity but he could not discern the cause of my symptoms and would refer me to a specialist for a second opinion. I was very stressed out but so happy that my friend Belle was there to support me and even though my head still ached from time to time I was able to finally sleep that night. I took some melatonin for sleep aid, put on my sleep mask and turned off the lights. That was surprisingly one of the best sleeps I have ever had."
