        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last month I was invited to a seminar for our company that was based in a different state.  This is an exclusive invite that only a handful of employees get to attend every year.  One of the people from our office that went was a man from accounting.  He is in his mid-20s and has such a contagious smile.  After the seminar ended one evening, we went out to a bar just to relax before returning to our hotel rooms.  One thing led to another, and we became quite close.  We've been dating since we have returned from that seminar, and even reported the relationship to HR.  He wants me to meet his family.  This would be all well and good, but I'm terrified what they must think of me.  I'm nearly 40, which makes me almost old enough to be his mother.  I hate that age is such a factor, but I can't help but feel the stares every time we go out.  So, I'm nervous to meet his family.  I haven't even told my own family that I'm seeing someone.  I just want things to be perfect with us just a bit longer.  I don't want to put the stigma on our relationship with the whispering that is sure to come from our families."
