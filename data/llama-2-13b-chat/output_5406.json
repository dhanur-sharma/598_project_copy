        "Summarize the following story in first person: Over this summer my family and I went on vacation to Hawaii with other family. All of the sights were amazing and it was the most beautiful place I've ever been to. We all stayed at this really nice resort.  My wife and I had our own room and my sons stayed in their own room. I felt so close to my family and we did some much fun stuff together. The best part was when my wife and I decided to renew our wedding vows on the beach. It was at night and she looked more beautiful than the day I met her. After the vow renewal me and my wife went to a local bar and enjoyed some live music and had drinks. After the trip was over I felt more close to my wife and kids than before. It really brought us together and gave us an experience we will never forget. My sons tell me everyday how they cant wait to go back. My wife has been very close to me since as well. I feel like that place really showed us how much we love each other. It was like paradise. We found a love for each other I dont think we knew about."
