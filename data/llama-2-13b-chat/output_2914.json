        "Summarize the following story in first person: I have recently experienced my oldest son turning 13 years old. I am writing about this because I consider it a emotional and changing time in my life. As children grow older, it becomes increasingly difficult to let them go and do things on their own. My son turning 13 has been hard on me because I will always see him as my baby. He is still in a way very much that sweet little boy that he has always been. However, he is growing more and more each day and I can only hope and pray he grows into a good young man. We are very close and I pray it stays that way. He does have autism so he\u2019s a little bit behind for his age. I just hope and pray that it does not affect his life tremendously in the long run. Sometimes, I think because of this disability he is a little more emotionally dependent than most 13-year-olds. As his mother , I will always be right here of course for him to be able to depend on. I do want him to grow though and be able to do things on his own as well. I guess it is just hard when your babies grow up to be teenagers and one day adults. I imagine this is a difficult emotional experience for all parents. I just feel extra attached because he is my first child and it feels especially hard to watch him grow up and become a man."
