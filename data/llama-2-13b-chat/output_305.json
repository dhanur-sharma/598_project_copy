        "Summarize the following story in first person: A while back, I came into contact with someone from my past. It was a bully. The person was someone who in school would pick of me nonstop. I had a small pit in my stomach when I used to see them around class, but never got over it. Who is to ever say that they weren't being mean to me? I always thought that they were being mean. This was based on how they acted around me and how I felt. Well, when I met hi,magain. They said hi. I had that same pit in my stomach that I had before from seeing them. He asked if I remembered them and I said \"Yea.\" It turns out that they were never meaning anything they said as ill will. They were just joking around with everyone. I told them I always took them as being a mean person and being just all around a bully. They apologized for that and I was sorry that I took the wrong intend of the situation. We ended up getting some coffee a little while later and catching up. I didn't realize that it was harmless fun!"
