        "Summarize the following story in first person: We went camping recently. We had another group camp with us. We arrived shortly before they did and started getting everything set up. Shortly we finished they pulled up. I had asked if they needed any help setting up since we were finished and they said no. I was okay with this because we had already spent a decent amount of time getting majority of the things set up. We all went on a walk to explore the campground in its entirety and decided to go swimming. When we came back we played a few games of cornhole. After this we started the camp fire and the grill we brought so we could cook dinner. We had a few drinks with dinner and started to settle around the campfire and have a few more drinks. I was drinking cold beer and somebody who we will call \"person B\" for the sake of this entry insisted on having some celebratory shots. I gave in. That was a mistake. By the time the shots caught up with me it was late. I was sitting on the top of a table when I lost my balance and fell to the ground. Everybody thought it was amusing, but it was a clear indication I drank way to much that night. We all went to bed shortly after."
