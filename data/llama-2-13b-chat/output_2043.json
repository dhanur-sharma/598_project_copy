        "Summarize the following story in first person: For the last five years, I have been constantly trying to get a hold of my mom. My mom is the strongest woman that I know and I admire her, she went through a lot of tough events that completely broke her and five years ago, she decided to move to France to try to find peace and to start a new and improved life. My mom has suffered from depression, anxiety and bipolar disorder for the longest time. I was happy for her when she decided to make a change to her life finally. But it didn't turn out very well as my father went to check on her once by surprise right after she had moved. It turns out that she was going through a deeper depression and nothing seemed to make her feel better. She did not want to see anyone and did not want to talk to anyone. So I have been trying to call her for five years almost every single day, but she never picked up... until last June.. I called her and she actually picked up. It was one of the best moments of my life. We talked for about five hours and I finally got to tell her something that I knew would make her the happiest. Me and my wife just had our first child together which means that my mom is now a grandma and when I broke the news, she couldn't stop crying, but I knew that this time, it was tears of joy. She was so excited as she had been asking me for so long to give her a grandkid. We got to catch up on different things, positive and not so positive ones but what matter is that I got to have her back in my life and I got to share the great news. I am so grateful for that day, that it finally did happen and that I don't have to feel like there is a huge part of my life missing. I will make sure that I keep on calling her everyday and hopefully soon she will come visit us and finally meet my son. I really feel like this year is the year where I finally feel like my life is complete."
