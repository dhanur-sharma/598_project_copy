        "Summarize the following story in first person: I have four boys. Growing up, I grew up with four sisters. Suffice to say, the experiences between myself and my sons are vastly different. Yesterday, I went to the doctor because I haven't had my period in weeks. Lo and behold, he confirmed I was pregnant. This is my fifth time getting pregnant, and as exciting as it is, it's still nerve wracking. I remember being nervous when my fourth son was born. I was the mother of four boys. In eight months time, I'll be the mom to five children. I am definitely as nervous or more nervous than I was when my fourth son was born. I'm going to get a sonogram to find out the gender. After having four boys, I'm not sure if I want a fifth boy or my first girl. As nice as it would be to have a daughter, I feel that having a fifth son would be an easier transition. None of the boys know how to operate with a female sibling around. My biggest concern is that if I have a daughter, she will feel isolated and alone. However, and as selfish as this sounds, if I do have a daughter, I finally have someone I can share girl things with."
