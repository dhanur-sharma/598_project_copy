        "Summarize the following story in first person: My daughter has grown up very fast right before my eyes. She is such a smart, and wonderful kid, I've always thought so. She's proving it today by acting like a big girl and going away to camp for a few weeks. It is a leadership camp to help her with her goals. This is a big step for me because she will be going to college soon. She has always been an independent child and I care for her a great deal. It is hard for me to see her go to this camp, but ultimately it will be good for us. I will hate to see her leave to college in two years but I will love the fact that she is starting her life. This is a significant step for us and I see it as a milestone.  I was so surprised to see her grow up so fast. Life goes by quickly when you are raising a child. She has been a joy to bring up and I am so proud of her. I cannot wait to see her aspirations and dreams come true for her. She works hard and is committed to her goals. She is a bright and wonderful girl and I am happy to be her mother. I think that anybody could say the same and I will miss her a lot when she is gone, but I will know that she is improving her life. I am so happy for her and I just cannot wait to see where she goes in life."
