        "Summarize the following story in first person: I am known in the world for my research and investigations of one of the world's greatest mysteries.   We have many people who write to us to either share their own experiences surrounding this mystery, which is known as the crystal skulls, or ask us questions.  About six months ago, a friend who also has her own crystal skulls asked me for advice and called me.  She felt it was time to create the next public conference where people could meet the most well known crystal skull teaches and investigators in the world and I said it sounded like a good idea. I have personally been invited to speak at various crystal skull conferences over the years as well as have helped to organize a few of these. Thus, my friend decided to create such a conference near Chicago and invited me to be one of the speakers.  This conference will take place later this current month. I was very thrilled and honored to be invited as I have been involved in investigating the crystal skulls for over 35 years and I have so much amazing information and insights to share about these mysterious objects.  However, it is in my nature to offer to help create such a conference as there are keys aspects  I have learned about how to incorporate in such an event that could enhance the experience of the attendees.  So the memorable event to  be shared in this essay is the phone call I had with my friend, who became the conference coordinator who rejected my participation to help and desired to do it on her own.  She explained that for her, in her past when she has worked with a group, things have not worked out well and wanted to make sure that the visions she had for the conference would be created.  This was of course a great disappointment for me and it took away my enthusiasm to be a part of the conference.  Over the months as the conference was being announced publicly I would offer to help and share it with others we know via emails and social media but in my heart, I knew this event would miss some key activities to really share about the crystal skulls.  I will just have to wait my time in the future, when we can put together the proper resources to create our own event which I believe will delight all those who attended and expand their knowledge about this mysterious objects.  For now, when the conference happens I will do the most memorable talk I can do as well as share with those who attend the special crystal skulls we personally have."
