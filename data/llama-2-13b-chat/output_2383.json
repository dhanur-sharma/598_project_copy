        "Summarize the following story in first person: In May of 2019 I flew to Holland to visit my family. During that time I was able to celebrate my parent's 50th wedding anniversary with them. Through some external circumstances I had not been able to go back to Holland for about 4 years. It was really nice to see everyone again. The day of the event our immediate family came together. First we went for a short hike in a nearby forest. Then we had dinner at a pancake house. After dinner we went back to my parents house for coffee, tea and dessert. As a gift I had digitally restored some pictures of my parents of when they were younger. I had put them together in a picture collage with a frame. My mom especially was very happy about this gift. She kept showing it to everyone that came over. This was the first time in years I was able to celebrate a wedding anniversary with my parents. Not everyone makes it to their 50th wedding anniversary. Being able to experience this was special to me and my family."
