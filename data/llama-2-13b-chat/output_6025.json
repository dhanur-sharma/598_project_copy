        "Summarize the following story in first person: A striking, positive moment that happened recently was when I got a $60 dollar jackpot at the slot machines. I have started playing some small amount of money daily and have gotten some wins the days before that day where I got the jackpot. After winning the jackpot, there were five people at the bar and I bought a each one of them a beer. It all felt like a good moment and I was expecting for it to not pass as quickly as it did. I play the slot machines mostly on weekends and usually cash out when I get double the amount of what I play when winning. That day I was on what seemed to be a losing streak, I had just put an extra dollar which was not planned for gambling that day. Still, I played that dollar and got the jackpot. This is surprising, because I never expect to win big when I play. I play mostly for entertainment and really needed the money that day. I also use strategies from a cousin of mine who used to play these electronic slot machines for a living. Still I would not want to see myself as a gambler or someone whose main goal in life is to strike it big on the slot machines. Unfortunately my situation and surroundings have made me start playing with some mixed results. On one side I like to play, win and buy everyone drinks when I cash out big. On the other hand, I know that this may not be a good habit, but still I think that right now because of my situation sometimes I feel there is nothing there to do, or nothing more memorable than hitting a jackpot at a slot machine. My life has been that stale recently, the only recent memorable memory is that I have hit a jackpot when gambling."
