        "Summarize the following story in first person: it was during my graduation ceremony. I had planned out my to do list as usual prior to the day. Then on the day came and i called my dry-cleaner service to ask why he hasn't deliver my cloth as promised . His number was not reachable. I called the assistant too. It was same thing. I thought i was going to loose it . because that was my only option ., As i intend to look my best on this day. I called my friend who introduced me to this company . I explained my ordeal and he promised to go check on my behalf . Waited another 15 minutes for my friends feedback. By this time ,the guy called to apologize for the inconveniences. I had no option than to accept his apology even though i was furious. He brought my cloth eventually and my friend came in too not long after . We headed out . I arrived  in time for my graduation. Family and friends are present already. We merry ,laughed. I was presented my award .I also took pictures with my other graduates . It was a memorable experience and overwhelming too. My family were happy for me,.They were proud of me too.. My mum especially could not hide her joy. We had after party with friends. I went back home to my family ,we prayed ,eat and merry. It was a sweet memory. I can never forget this day."
