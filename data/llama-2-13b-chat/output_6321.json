        "Summarize the following story in first person: Today was really sad. My stepfather passed away. I was out running errands when my mother called me telling me he had been in a accident and that i needed to get to the hospital right away. I stopped what i was doing and made the twenty minute drive there only to find out he passed away about four minutes before i got there. It's hard to believe he passed away. My poor mom is beside herself. We are absolutely stunned by this. They say now that it was a drunk driver. He drove right through a red light ramming my stepfathers car. When he T-Boned  my step fathers car he crushed the entire drivers side door in. They had to use the jaws of life to pry the doors open to help him. The detectives say they have a lead on who hit him. They went back to the scene and got footage of the crash. The footage gave them a clear enough view to see the liscense plate. I really hope they catch who did this and get justice for our family."
