        "Summarize the following story in first person: Lately, in life, my wife and i had been very stressed out between work and personal things. We realized we needed a break and one quickly. We decided that in one week we were going to hop on a plane and go across the country to Disney world. We had been there a few times but that was years ago. We have gone on small trips here and there since then but those usually involved some kind of work. We needed a complete break and just life reset. we were just going to go for a week relax have some fun and then make our way back home. Well our trip started out with being upgraded to first class. This is something we never had the money to afford. Then we landed in orlando and  realized our baggage was lost. Some weird fluke had happened where they sent our luggage far away so to make up for it they gave us each $500 to shop for new clothes. we bought basic necessities then used the last to buy memorabilia from disney wold. We were able to spend all week relaxing and going to each diffrent park without any stress. It was the best vacation i ever took. No stress for the first time in years was also very nice. I will never forget this vacation."
