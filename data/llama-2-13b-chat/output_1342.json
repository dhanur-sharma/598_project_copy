        "Summarize the following story in first person: My brother just had a baby girl, so I decided to surprise him and visit him and his family. It was great to be able to go there and see everyone. We really had a great time! The baby looks just like him and has his eyes. He said that everyone thinks the baby looks like her mom, but I don't see that. While I was at their home, my dad came over to visit as well. He was shocked to see me! Not as shocked as I was to see him with another woman! I introduced myself to her and my dad said \"This is my girlfriend.\" I raised an eyebrow to that one since he had just gotten out of a relationship. She seemed really nice and my brother said that she was a great woman. I thought if she was a perfect fit for my dad, then she can't be that bad. I just hate seeing him go in and out of all these relationships. After a while, we ate and laughed and I felt like I had known her for years! She was telling me about a cove at the beach that was so beautiful and peaceful. She loved to go there to sit and think. I told her that sounded wonderful and that I'd have to see it before I left. The next day, we went to the cove with my dad and his girlfriend. She knew the perfect spot! I can't even believe that all this time we were that close to that place and never visited it!"
