        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 3 months ago I got married. It was a beautiful spring day, the sun was shining but it wasn't too hot. I slept okay - I could've done with another hour or two. I think I was restless and anxious during the night. Nothing bad, just kind of... itching to get on with it. Nervous excitement. I tried to relax while getting ready, taking my time to drink a bit of coffee and just enjoy the day. Only people I loved and cared about would be there for the whole day so there was really nothing to be nervous about, but still, you want everything to be perfect. That all went to pieces when I spilled coffee on my shirt - it was easily hidden by my jacket, thankfully, but my goodness did it surprise me how stressed out I got about it. In the grand scheme it didn't matter, but of course, it had to be the one day I spill something down myself. No-one even noticed until I pointed it out, and by that point I realized how little it mattered in the grand scheme of things. It was a perfect day, not in spite of the things that went a bit wrong, but because of it. Everyone was supportive and in good spirits. My partner and I had everything we wanted, just as we wanted it. It really felt like our day, and a celebration of us."
