        "Summarize the following story in first person: I've been struggling a bit lately financially. I'm not making the same money I was making at my job, and things are really tight for me right now. I had a flat tire on my car, and I changed it and put the donut tire on. I cant afford to buy a new tire right now. The donut tire has a slow leak though, and I was always putting air in it. The whole situation has just has me down and depressed. I work with a good friend of mine. We are close and have been friends for a long time. She knows I have been struggling with things.  She asked me one day if she could use my car on her lunch break to run a couple errands.  Her husband had dropped her off that day because he car was getting an oil change. I told her sure and gave her the keys. She came back to work after her lunch and gave me my keys and we went about our day. I left work that day and went out to my car. Something was different on it, and it took me a minute realize that my donut tire was gone, and there was a brand new tire on my car. I stood there dumbfounded thinking \"how did this happen?\" and I called my friend and asked her if she knew anything about. She laughed, and told me \"Happy Birthday\" that she had bought me a new tire for my car for my Birthday that was coming. I was so surprised and touched, that I burst into tears. She is an amazing friend, and I am blessed to have her in my life!"
