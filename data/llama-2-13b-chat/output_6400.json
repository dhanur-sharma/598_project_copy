        "Summarize the following story in first person: Taking a walk through the Detroit Institute of Arts was an experience that I wasn't expecting to experience anytime soon. It was a great way to end the semester after all the new concepts I have learned from the online ARTH 100 course. Walking through the DIA and seeing concepts that each artist included into their own works of art was truly beautiful, and I wasn't able to see this type of beauty portrayed in their work until after I had taken this course online. Furthermore, one of my many favorites had to be Fowl and Melons, an oil canvas painting, painted by Sisson Blanchard  who is from Haiti, born in 1952. This oil painting was truly beautiful and caught my eye due to the colors and uniqueness of the birds. Looking deeper into the painting were details that didn't originally catch my eye, and that I had to look for. That being said, there were watermelons actually painted in between the birds in this painting! That being said, colors had a big influence on how my eye caught these details. The colors red, orange, yellow, deep blue and purple; it gave off a warmth feeling of harmony. I believe there is a reason why the artist choose these colors after staring at the painting for so long and my theory comes down to this: I believe that due to the amount of scattered birds in this picture, the artist wanted to balance this by carefully choosing which colors to incorporate into this painting without taking away the uniqueness of the painting. As far as shape goes, the lines formed by the artist is what makes the shape of the painting; mainly targeting the birds and the hard-to-miss details of the melons in between. The texture in this painting is oily (which is ironic considering it is an oil painting), but the details such as the feather bumps and circles make it as if the birds were rough and bumpy. Then on the other hand you have a bunch of shrubbery in all the possible spaces where there wasn't a bird placed. The shrubbery makes you feel as if you were to get poked by touching this painting, just like as if you were about to touch a cactus. Finally we have the last element of art; Value. Value is the illusion portrayed by the artist by using different shades and tones of light in the painting. Since this painting is very cluttered and there are so many details to be contributed in this piece, we can see that the value of light used in this painting was strong due to the colors used in the painting as well.  Overall, the trip to the Detroit Institute of Art museum was an experience that I previously wasn't planning on going on, anytime in the near future; but I'm glad I took this opportunity to look at different works of art and to analyze paintings using what I've learned from this course. It was a great opportunity to look at beautiful expressions that the artists portrayed using something as simple as oil pastels, like Sissan\u2019s did while painting Fowl and Melons."
