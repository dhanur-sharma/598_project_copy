        "Summarize the following story in first person: Two months ago I found myself in the unfortunate situation of being unemployed. I had tried my hand at being a writer, something I always wanted to do, but the sales of my first book were stagnant. I sat at home, wondering how I was going to pay all of my bills, and stared at my useless degree in economics. I never had a passion for economics, and always wanted to do something related to writing. As I contemplated my options, which pretty much amounted to flipping burgers at this point, I got a call from my friend Amy. She mentioned that she had the perfect opportunity for me. Her seventh grade class was doing a lesson on writing, and she wanted me to teach them. I immediately started to freak out. I had no formal training in writing. I mean, it was a passion of mine, but I was mostly self taught. How was I supposed to get a bunch of unruly seventh graders to listen to me? I decided that I wasn't really in a position to act superior to them. I decided to think humble thoughts, and place myself on their level. If I could think of what would interest a seventh grader, I could get through to them. The day of the lesson, I was so nervous. I started to doubt myself. There was no way I would be able to get through to these kids and I was going to fail. Amy talked to me a few minutes before we started, and told me that the students like a certain television show set in the 1980s where the characters have adventures. A light bulb went off in my head. All I had to do was relate the lesson plan to the television show that I also liked, and was very familiar with. The lesson was a great success. Amy even invited me to continue helping her and she thinks I will eventually get a full time job there. I was so delighted, and couldn't believe it."
