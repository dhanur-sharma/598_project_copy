        "Summarize the following story in first person: Two months ago I had an amazing day but with some ups and downs added in.  I wanted to have the most perfect wedding with my fiance. This didn't quite happen the way we wanted, and there was a few things that dampened our spirits. Let me start by mentioning the worst part first. Most couples want a perfect wedding but I am sure that doesn't always happen. Here is what happened to us. My wedding morning started off terrible. It was not the best as far as weather goes. There was rain coming down, and thundering. Not only that but started at the same time as my ceremony, I mean exactly! That caused everyone to bring the chairs, and everything else including the food indoors. Then we waited til the storm left until we started it again. We dragged everything outside again instead of just having the wedding indoors. The greatest thing about it is that we saw a rainbow during the time of the marriage vows we exchanged, eventually. This sometimes means an old friend or relative who has passed is looking down upon us in heaven and smiling. That made me happy too."

It was the worst catering service I have ever had. I could not believe it. I was so disappointed. That really put a damper on the whole day. I was so excited to have my dream wedding. But that did not happen. Instead, it was a wedding that I will never forget. I have to remember that there is always a bright side. The bright side is that I got married to the love of my life and that is all that matters. I will always remember this day for the rest of my life.\n\n"
