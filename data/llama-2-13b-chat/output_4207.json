        "Summarize the following story in first person: My two sons, my boyfriend, and I took a trip to Cape Cod this past May for a vacation. It was the first time that my boyfriend had traveled with my boys. We've been together for 2 years, and he really gets along well with my boys. But still, I was a little nervous about how it would go. I am pleased to say it went really well.  We rented a house to stay for the week that we were there. It was nice because we could cook our meals right there. We were also able to rent bikes. We went on a number of bike rides throughout the area. My boyfriend took the boys on a few rides just the 3 of them as well, which was really nice. Little did I know, they were also planning a surprise for me. We did a beautiful tour of lighthouses by sunset. Lighthouses are something  I really like to see. As we were watching the sun set, my boyfriend dropped down on one knee to propose! And he had my sons read a poem to me. It was sooo sweet that he included them. Of course, I said yes. Wow, what an amazing trip!"
