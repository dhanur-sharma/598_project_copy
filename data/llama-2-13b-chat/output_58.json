        "Summarize the following story in first person: When someone moves out of the rental property next to me, I never know who's going to move in.  Most of the time, that's not a problem, but every now and then, it is.  I've had to put up with some incredibly obnoxious neighbors there in the past.  Consequently, I always hold my breath when someone's moving out until I know who's going to live there next, always hoping for the best.  This new neighbor moved in as fast as my old neighbors moved out.  I heard her over there the first day she was there and I walked over to introduce myself to her.  She's ten years older than I am, single, and very pleasant.  As it turns out, surprisingly, we know a lot of the same people and have a lot of interests in common.  Our values seem to be the same, and both of us want to be good neighbors, which is a relief to both of us.  (She was concerned about what type of person I was, too.)  My new neighbor and I quickly started becoming friends.  When we see each other outside, we always take a few minutes to exchange pleasantries and talk.  She has trouble doing some things because she has a bad back, so I've been helping her out whenever I can.  She's so grateful for that, she's gone out of her way to do some things for me.  She loves to cook and she's shared meals with me.  She has little dinner parties every other week or so and I'm always invited.  I've really enjoyed getting to know my new neighbor.  I always enjoy seeing her and I know she's there for me.  If I have to go away, I know she'll keep an eye on the place for me, and likewise, I'd do the same for her.  It makes living in such close proximity very comfortable, and that's worth its weight in gold."
