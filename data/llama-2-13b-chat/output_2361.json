        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was working the a couple of weeks ago at my second job. It is in the evenings that I am normally at work, and so tired after working all day at my main job. I started my shift like any other day, saying I hope it is not busy and this night goes by quickly. I was working my shift, folding clothes and talking to customers just like any other day. It was then that I was approached by a regular customer. An older gentleman, who was kind of slower, but wanted to talk to me. Of course I was feeling impatient, and tried to talk as calmly as possible, and that is when he surprised me. He mentioned how pretty I was, and how much he enjoys coming into the store when when I am there. It shocked me. I don't feel most people pay attention to me. I was actually able to smile and be grateful for the older mans compliments. It isn't often that people pay attention, and I felt like he did. I felt special even if just for a moment. I felt like I walked away learning to enjoy my customers and job a little more. Also, that people are good people, even the ones that you wouldn't normally have the patience for."
