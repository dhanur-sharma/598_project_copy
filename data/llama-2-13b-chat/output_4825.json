        "Summarize the following story in first person: Several weeks before My daughter left for France, I saw some strange behavior appealed, such as some weight loss, sleeplessness and dark circles around the eyes . As a father I became concerned, asked some questions and tried to Know what was wrong with my daughter. I took her to three different physicians within two weeks. And just two days after seeing the second doctor, on November 4th, 2000, she came home from basketball, where she was coaching her sister\u2019s football team, and fell down to the ground. She had suffered from a massive heart attack because of using a drug called meth. We learned of her meth use in the ICU. She was in a coma. The doctor explained that they found methamphetamine in her system and that every time you use meth it damages your heart. And after she went to practice and worked hard for two hours, she came home and suffered a massive heart attack. She literally blew out the bottom of her heart. After several days her eyes opened and I asked the neurologist if she was waking up. He took my daughter\u2019s head in his hands and gently rolled her head from side to side and every time he rolled her head her eyes would roll with the head. \u201cThat\u2019s called doll eyes,\u201d he explained. A sign of permanent, irreversible brain damage. Several days later we gave our permission for life support to be disconnected. And as we loved and caressed our daughter, she slipped out of our arms and into eternity, without giving us a second chance to help her."
