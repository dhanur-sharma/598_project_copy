        "Summarize the following story in first person: My husband and I traveled to Florida this past summer. We stayed at an upscale resort courtesy of a work-related conference that my husband was attending. I remember that the event happened was a Friday. My husband was golfing that day as part of a networking event. To make the trip more enjoyable for me, he booked me a full day at the spa. I was to have a body scrub, mani/pedi and warm stone massage. The man who gave me the body scrub was from France. I enjoyed chatting with him about global issues, our families and many other topics. After my body scrub I got a mani/pedi. I had a short break after that before my warm stone massage. I was surprised to see that my massage therapist was the same man who did my body scrub. I was tired at this point in the day, and I didn't really want to talk as much. I just wanted to relax. About 15 minutes or so into the massage, it seemed to me that the massage therapist was leaning his crotch into me. My hand was at my side, and it felt like he was press against my hand. I began to feel uncomfortable, but I believed I was probably misinterpreting the action. A little while later into the massage I was turned over onto my back, and the massage therapist began using a warm stone to massage my inner thigh. I was uncomfortable because he spent an inordinate amount of time massaging that area and several times his hand brushed against my underwear. I laid there very stiff and uncomfortable and was relieved when the massage was finally over"
