        "Summarize the following story in first person: Five months ago I accepted a part-time position as a barista at Starbucks.  I also have a full-time day job, but I needed extra income to off set the inconsistency of my ex-husband's child support payments. I want my children to be able to participate in extra-curricular activities, and I want to be able to celebrate birthdays and Christmas in moderate style without worrying about debt.  I also need to pay down debt that has accrued due to the missing child support payments.  It has been difficult juggling two jobs and three children.  Lately, I have been scheduled five days per week at Starbucks.  Almost every day I leave my day job, and go straight to my second job. I don't get home until almost 11 pm, and I have to be up at 6 am to help the kids get ready for school, and to get ready for my day job.  I am physically drained when I get home, and am not getting enough sleep on nights that I close at Starbucks. I am worried that this lack of sleep will negatively impact my health. It has been exhausting.  The kids have helped out a bit, but the house is still a mess, and I miss spending time with my children.  I have requested a schedule change so that I won't have to close so many nights each week, so hopefully that will help.  The good news is that being scheduled so much has enabled me to pay for many of the first of school expenses without having to request extensions. Ah well, this is but a season in life, and will pass."
