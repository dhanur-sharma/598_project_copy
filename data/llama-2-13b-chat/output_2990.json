        "Summarize the following story in first person: This goes back 10 months when I used to live in my mother country, India. I lived in India most of my life and a lot of things went down while I was in India. India was really fun growing up but it came with a lot of sad things. We had a really happy family back then, mother, father, sons and a daughter. One day, we come from a party and everything was really good. Little did we know, that party caused something to happen to my sister. Next day at 8PM, my sister hung herself. This was the most tragic event of my life, I never imagined my life without her but shit. She was 5 years older than me and she helped me with EVERYTHING in my life. She helped me with my math problems and tell me about her life. We had so much fun together. I just with I knew that my time with her was limited because that would've caused me to live my life even better while I was with her. Life took a bad turn after I lost her. Everything went downhill, and my family were traumatized. I never hope something like this happens to anyone but what can you do."
