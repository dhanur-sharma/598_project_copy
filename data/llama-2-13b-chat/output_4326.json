        "Summarize the following story in first person: The event was me getting to see my cousin and his family after not seeing him in over 17 years. The most memorable part was reconnecting with him and getting to meet his 3 children, who he didn't have the last time I saw him.  I took them around the city and showed them a lot of the popular attractions around here. I think they were happy to get the super in depth tour, and got to show them things that other people probably wouldn't know about visiting here. The event was significant to me, because its important to maintain relationships with family. It was both about the past and the future to some degree. In a way seeing him again reminded me of several events from my past, and allowed me to remember some of those past events with him. Seeing him again also was positive because it sort of reignited our relationship, and we now have a bit of basis to build on to further enhance our relationship going forward. Meeting his family was very important as well. They are already almost young adults themselves now, and it was important for us to connect so that they knew who their extended family is.  We have already been in a touch a bit more since we last met. I am hoping we can keep the momentum going. The event overall was pretty significant for me because it put family in the forefront of my mind. It kind of reassures me to know that no matter how much time passes, or how far away you are, there is always an opportunity to reconnect with family. I'm definitely going to try to go visit him within the next year or two to keep in touch and keep time between us shorter."
