He had some type of sickness that greatly impacted some of the things he did. about 5 months ago we had taken him to the doctor to get a check up. we just wanted to know what was wrong with our son. it took almost all day during that one appointment. The doctors finally told us about the what our son was diagnosed with. once they told me I just couldn't come to the acceptance of my son having this issue. I didnt wan't to face the truth of what was going on because it was hard. luckily my husband was there for me being able to calm me and guide me thoughout this problem. I really loved being with him because of his great support. I can get through almost anything with him and I love it. Eventually I just had to stop making things worse for myself. I knew I had to accept what was going on. The issues my son was having really took a toll on me. At the end I did prevail and was able to get my thoughts back together. I had to be in the best place to help my son."
