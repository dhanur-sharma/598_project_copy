        "Summarize the following story in first person: My best friend growing up had a kid.  He was the youngest of the group of friends.  He had a baby boy with his first serious girlfriend.  It put my life into perspective and made me rethink the way I was living.  I was smoking alot of weed and drinking and not concentrating on being successful.  My friend eventually grew apart and became a full time dad.  He was  great dad.  I wanted the same thing so I stop drinking and smoking.  I started working out more as well.  I eventually abbged a good woman.  I think seeing my friend grow up made me want to do the same.  I liked that my friend was a good dad and I think he eventually had more kids.  We both grew up and apart and I wonder how he is doing lately.  I now live in a big city and moved away from the small town where we all grew up.  I hope to one day see my friends again and catch up."
