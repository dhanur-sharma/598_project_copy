        "Summarize the following story in first person: well after watching youtube conspiracy video one day I decided to try out the experiment and replicate it for myself. the person in the video had seen a chemtrail being inserted in the clouds by a glowing orb that turned out to be a demon. the person in the video rebuked it in the name of Jesus and it went away and disappeared. So that it what I did as well and it also happened that the rain clouds decided to go away as well too. we did not have any rain for like 3 months where I lived because I figured out how to do a reverse rain dance! prior to this we were getting too much rain and the farmers were not able to plant their crops so everyone was going to starve. I am happy to say that will not be the case now! However, there was one drawback. Which wound up being the fact that because there was no rain the air pressure built up. So the atmosphere wound up producing a land hurricane. It destroyed a large area and was very dangerous. All is well that ends well. I was happy that the crops were left unharmed. I love watching youtube videos. i also feel like I have learned a lot."
