        "Summarize the following story in first person: Well it happened a little over 8 months ago... I think. I was working as the manager of a small university gym. I had some other duties as well but that was a main one. My boss, who had always liked me in the past, called me to tell me she wanted to interview this new girl. I was confused. We didn't need a new girl. I had arranged with one of my employees to continue her temporary employment through the summer and beyond. I communicated this to my boss. She did not care. She wanted to proceed with the interview. So the girl comes in.. it is obviously just a formality. I think she even had the answers to the questions beforehand. Anyway, the girl gets hired against my will. I am told to let my original worker go, which I did. OK, whatever. Then a few weeks later, my boss is coming at me more and more with just the littlest stuff that doesn't matter in the least. Stuff she had used to overlook. But now, it was all a problem. She starts writing me up for things she never would have in the previous few years I had worked there. Until one day, she also sent it to Human Resources recommending my termination. HR clearly didn't agree with the decision but just did their part in the matter since it wasn't technically their decision. Then I find out a couple of weeks later my job was given to the new part time girl she made me hire, her friend. Unbelievable."
