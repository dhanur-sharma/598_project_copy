        "Summarize the following story in first person: On Saturday night, we went over to a friend's house. Maybe 8-9 of us total. We had some chili, things felt very stiff and sad. But then we said, \"Well hey, let's write some messages to him on these balloons and release them!\" Everyone was feeling that idea, so everybody grabbed a Sharpie and retreated into a corner and wrote a little missive. (I did 4, myself - confessing that I was sorry for letting the dog go, telling him I loved him, I don't even remember). Somebody at one point drew some male genitals, which he'd have cracked up at, and that had everyone laughing a little bit. We loosened up, released the balloons into the night sky, and then went back inside. We wound up drinking a little more but mostly just playing Cards Against Humanity and Heads Up, which were his favorite card games. The stuffy, church service his family put on was Saturday morning - Saturday night was for US and what WE wanted to do, and we knew he'd have wanted exactly that - friends gathered around, playing games and laughing. It felt so good to laugh. Sunday morning bright and early I drove to Atlanta to participate in the AFSP (American Foundation for Suicide Prevention) walk. I'd wound up raising over $1,000 under his name for the cause - $1,015 I believe to be exact. I got a free t-shirt and I think they'll give me some other piece of swag later, but whatever, I wasn't there for the swag. We met up with my good friend from college. It was just a 1 1/2 mile walk and when it was over we drove to this place right by Piedmont Park called the Nook that specializes in nachos made of tater tots."
