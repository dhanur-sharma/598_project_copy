        "Summarize the following story in first person: So, I had a bad couple of weeks recently.  One morning, I woke up and did my normal morning routine.  I heard the neighbors upstairs getting ready to leave, as usual.  A few minutes after I heard the mom and kid leave, I heard a really loud noise from up there.  I thought maybe the boyfriend had dropped something heavy.  I didn't think too much of it because I heard footsteps afterward and figured all was well.  About 5 to 10 minutes later, there was loud banging on my front door and people yelling outside.  The apartment above mine was on fire and I had to get my son up and get out. It seems as though the neighbor's boyfriend did something to set the fire, which is probably the noise I had heard.  It burned really hot and fast.  My apartment became unlivable due to water and smoke damage, so we were forced to move to another apartment.  We are now almost settled into our new apartment.  It has been difficult to manage, and we still need to replace some of the furniture we lost.  We could have filed a personal property insurance claim, but most of what was lost wasn't really worth anything since it was second-hand older items for the most part. I can't help but to keep thinking about it.  I wonder what might have happened if I had slept late that day.  I don't know that we would have been okay if I wasn't awake, or if it had burned just a little faster."
