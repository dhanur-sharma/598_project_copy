        "Summarize the following story in first person: Let me tell you about the first time I used a chainsaw. It happened at the end of May this year. My mother got a letter from the city about some land that she didn't know she owned, and how the overgrown state of it was making the neighbors upset. They gave us a month to clear the land or they'd do it for us and put a lien on the property for the amount it took to do so It's in a residential neighborhood and apparently health and safety is important. She doesn't have the kind of money necessary to pay someone to do it, so my mother decided that I would do it for her. Mom went down to ABC Rental, and rented a chainsaw, lawnmower, and what I can only describe as a chainsaw on a stick (which I was too scared to use). There were only 8 dead trees on the property, and my sanity does appreciate that, but I had to cut down each one by myself as my mother chain-smoked in her car. Well, she was there on the first day, I had to come back several times by myself. Did you know that equipment like chainsaws don't take straight gasoline to power? I didn't, and I was really surprised to find out I needed an oil mixture to make it all run. And, though the guys at ABC Rental told her this, my mother didn't see fit to tell me about it at all. So, after some severe googling, I finally got the thing running. I had to look up videos of tree cutting on YouTube in order to see what I was supposed to be doing. Cut out a triangle in the direction you want to tree to land, and go for it. I went for it. It didn't really work. Or, I didn't really work. Using a chainsaw requires an upper body strength that I don't have. The trees fell in the general direction that I wanted them to, but I had to be really careful about where I was and what I was doing. Which is natural, I guess. It was so much work. I, as a 32 year old woman completely unequipped for this type of task, did my best. I could only do one tree per day because I tired out so easily. I will never do this type of work again. I only slightly resent my mother for it, too."
