        "Summarize the following story in first person: One of the worst things that could happen happened not too long ago.  We were finally at a stage in our lives, after working very hard for it to where we could and did just bought a new home less than a year ago that was a nice size and could fit my husband, me, our 3 kids and our dog very comfortably.  My husband had a really good job and we were able to live comfortably.  That all changed when another company took over the company my husband was working for. They came in and did a complete take-over. My husband's new boss decided he didn't like him and he wasn't cut out to be their type of 'material' even though my husband is the best in his field.  Without warning, my husband's new boss was waiting for him when he got to work the other morning.  Along with 4 armed police officers.  He fired my husband right then and there and couldn't even give him a reason why he was firing him.  He couldn't because my husband did nothing wrong at all. The police officers 'escorted' my husband back out to his truck.  He was humiliated and upset and furious.  So here we are now. We had to sell our new house and move into a 1000 square foot rental that doesn't even begin to fit all of us.  My piddly job barely brings in enough to put food on the table to feed all of us. My husband has tried and tried to get another job, but nobody seems to want to interview him probably due to his age.  I am just so upset about everything. I have so much worry (about how we're going to take care of our kids), anger and hatred for what that person did to him, and sadness over the entire thing.  It's taking a toll on my health, mentally and physically.  No one should have to go through this. If he had done something wrong, then yes, I could understand this happening, but he didn't.  We've sought an attorney, but they said what they did was not illegal, completely wrong and immoral, but not illegal, so there is nothing we can do.  I'm just sick!!!"
