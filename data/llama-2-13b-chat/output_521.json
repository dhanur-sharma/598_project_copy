I wanted it to be something I could remember forever in a scrapbook with all of the things you see on the movies. But instead I was a sweaty, dirty, heaping mess. He rode in a taxi to college. I waited with the repairman. It took several hours. By the time it was done, I had to head home for work. I didn't get to see the dorm or help him decorate. The car ended up costing over $300 not including the towing fee. Nick was fine, of course. He probably preferred the privacy and not to have his mother following him around campus. But move-in day was such a big thing for me that I'm really hurt it didn't go better. I think I'll make a special trip up there sometime this month. I want to visit and see everything. Maybe that will make me feel better. I don't know that I'll ever forget sniffling and trying not to hug him too tightly, though. I didn't want to get him dirty. I will be a heaping mess when his siblings go off to college, too."
