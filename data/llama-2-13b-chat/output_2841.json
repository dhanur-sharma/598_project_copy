        "Summarize the following story in first person: That cry-baby table tennis player was Albert. Since that event, I was telling about him to all the players I had a chance to talk to. All the people I was speaking with said they are not surprised. Albert is acting like that not only to me. Every time he looses, he always has some excuse. Floor is to slippery. Light is terrible in this place. I didn't get a chance to warm up ! This ball is not a three star ball ! The opponent's serve was not a legal serve ! ...and many many other ridiculous excuses - because there is no other way to call these. I find a behavior like that pathetic...  when You loose - You loose. Shake the other player's hand, smile and thank him for the game and don't be a baby... nobody likes people like that.Anyway - Albert and myself - we've met again. It was not a tournament, just a regular league, but if he would loose, he would still loose rating points. I saw him not coming to the table when it was our turn to play. I went to him and I told him we should play now. He answered - no. Just \"no\". He gave no explanation, like... I'll play You later, or I'm not playing with You, or ANYTHING. He just said \"no\" like a retarder baby and not a grown up man that he is. I told him then - I'll let You warm up for as long as You want, c'mon, let's play. I just got another \"no\". I find that really disrespectful and I said to him that he is a coward. Nothing - no reaction, no nothing. I mean, if someone is calling You a coward, You want to explain some things with him right ? Naah, I got nothing from Albert...  This tells us what kind of a man he is. This was his chance for a rematch and getting his points back, but he acted like a child again."
