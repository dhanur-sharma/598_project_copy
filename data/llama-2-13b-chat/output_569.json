        "Summarize the following story in first person: Today i had one of my best recent memories was when I took my dad to the Game 7 watch party for the Stanley Cup.  It was an away game so we couldn't go to the actual game but we had the next best thing in watching it at the stadium with 20 thousand other fans.  My dad said he didn't want to go since he couldn't handle the stress of the game but i surprised him with tickets anyways.  This was a big deal for me since my dad is the reason I am into hockey and he had been watching the Blues his whole life and they have never won it.  I knew he would regret it if he just stayed home watching the game alone instead of having the chance to be downtown if we actually won it.  It was a stressful start of the game but luckily we scored first and never looked back. We looked like a team on a mission and that mission was to bring the Stanley cup to our town for the first time ever.  I could see my dad got a little more happy and less stressed with each goal we scored like he was starting to believe we might actually do it.  I was also freaking out inside because i knew we had been close before but always got let down and anything can happen in sports. Its never over until the final horn sounds so in the back of our minds we kept thinking the worst.  When they actually did it we went crazy with all the other people at the stadium but also I could see my dad crying a little. It brought me joy to know how happy he was in this moment and i was glad i was here to share it with him.  This is something we will continue to talk about for years to come and we will always know where we were when it happened.  He brought me to a game 7 in the world series when i was young so this was also a way for me to repay the favor but i hope to repay it again sometime in our lifetime with an actual game ticket.  To be in that stadium though when the whole city felt like they won was a great memory to have and one that I will be forever grateful i shared with my dad."
