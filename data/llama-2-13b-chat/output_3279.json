        "Summarize the following story in first person: Recently I had a friend pass away, it was very upsetting and truly a horrible event. my friend got hit by a bus and it was really bad, she fell over into the middle of the road by accident and got killed immediately. it was tragic, it was really bad and i really dont like to think about it at all. everyday i think about it and it still causes me mental issues because i saw it in person, i was there when it happened. I saw my friend trip and fall into a bus that was oncoming in traffic. it was arguably the worst thing i've ever seen or witnessed in my entire life. it was just terrible and i hate to think about it. The bus immediately stopped as well, but she was dead on impact. The bus was going very fast as well, it wasn't slowing down. My friend should still be alive. She accidentally tripped and fell. Mistakes and life happens sometimes. You can't really help it sometimes. Life really gets the better of you and its shameful. Maybe it was her time to go? I don't really know yet, i haven't decided if it was fate or not."
