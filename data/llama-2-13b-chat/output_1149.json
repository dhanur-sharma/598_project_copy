        "Summarize the following story in first person: At the age of 40 I recently went on my first camping trip ever.  My wife, 2 daughters and I traveled from coastal San Diego to the Palomar Mountain area where we camped outdoors for several nights in April of 2019.  While it was Spring time, the elevation of the campsite atop the mountain made for a very cold camping experience.  We arrived on the first afternoon to the campsite.  We were one of a total of 4 families camping at a campsite that could accommodate 50 campers, so that should have been our first clue that we might have picked a bad time to go camping.  We were very organized in that all of our camping gear was packed  well in our car such that we were easily able to extract things like the tent first.  After we had the tent erected, we placed the air mattresses inside of it and prepared the sleeping bags, and organized our clothing.  Once all of that was set-up, I decided to take a nap in the car (since I was still fighting off a lingering head cold) so my wife took our daughters to go for a short hike.  About at hour later my wife returned and we began to make preparations for dinner by setting up the fire.  While I had no experience camping, by wife had a reasonable amount of experience, so she was able to get the fire going without too much difficulty.  However, as we were warming dinner and the sun began to set, the temperature began to plummet.  My daughters and I began throwing on more and more layers of clothing in order to keep ourselves warm.  My wife, who was hovering over the fire while tending to the food, was not overly cold but she was stunned at how chilly it was getting so quickly.  I sat by the fire, eagerly awaiting dinner, with my two daughters crammed onto my lap as I sat in one of our folding camping chairs.  We ate dinner and the girls happily made smoores afterwards, but that didn't last long as the temperatures dipped into the 30's!  We put out the fire and retired to our tent in order to get some sleep.  We rearranged all of the sleeping bags and air mattresses so that we had 2 people in each one: myself and my smallest daughter in one, and my wife and older daughter in the other.  I was wearing 3 sweatshirts and had 2 extra blankets over me, but that was just barely enough to keep me from shivering all night long.  When the sun arose, we quickly started another fire, but quickly ran through the remainder of our firewood just to keep from shivering constantly all morning long.  After the sun was fully up, we were able to hike and bird watch, then enjoy a filling lunch.  However, as the sun began to drop in the sky the second day, the temperatures plunged too much.  We opted to take down the tent, re-pack the car, and head home so that we wouldn't have to endure another frigid (by San Diego standards) night on the mountain.  In spite of the cold, this was a fun first camping adventure with my wife and kids and I look forwards to doing it again."
