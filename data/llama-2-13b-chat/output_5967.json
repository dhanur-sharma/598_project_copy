        "Summarize the following story in first person: My friend D, who lives on the other coast wanted to pay for a trip for my friend M, who was recently diagnosed with a serious illness. M had no time for anything but work and treatment but loved to travel. D felt bad about not being able to help her with anything from so far away. She also felt like I was doing the majority of the day to day care and doctor's appointments, so she wanted me to come on the trip too. M wanted to pick a tropical location. So D paid for an accommodation at a place it would be easy enough for us all to get to. We were each responsible for our own flights. D flew in from the West Coast and M and I took the same flight from the East Coast. D was already there when we arrived. M and I pulled up in the taxi and saw the hotel was more beautiful than we imagined. We could never imagine staying in a place like this before. There were several pools to choose from and well as being right on the beach so the ocean was steps away. At night we would go out or simply walk around in the beautiful tropical weather. We were able to just relax for awhile and give M a chance to breathe. It wasn't always an easy trip, given the reason we went but the memories were well worth it."
