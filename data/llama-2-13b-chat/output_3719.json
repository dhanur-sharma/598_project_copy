        "Summarize the following story in first person: Dear Diary....Today was a good day. Me, mom, dad, pat and jimmy went to the docks and we rented this boat from some guy. He was really nice, he seemed interested in what we were gonna do. We all decided to go on a deep sea fishing  trip for the day. We all made turkey and ham sandwiches, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and of course had plenty of water. We made our way out to the docks which is about a 2 hour drive from the house. We leave really really early in the morning. Its still dark out when we leave. me pay and jimmy sleep in the back of the car on th eway there. I think mom falls asleep too im sure, because my dad drove. We dont get alot of time to go out as a family anymore because we are all so busy with work, school and everything else going on in our lives right now. This will probably be the last time for me as well. The baby is coming in a few months. I still have so much shopping to do!!! Well anyways, when we got home we put all of our fish together. We had so much fish. We cooked them and we all had our own spices that we wanted to use so we ended up cooking the fish in our own spices and shared with eceryone else so we got to taste everyones favorite spices. it was such a great day, i hope we could do thi severy day! but life gets in the way too much."
