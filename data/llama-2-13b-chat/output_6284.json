        "Summarize the following story in first person: I got a new job offer at a business that was in another town from where I had worked. As soon as I got that offer, I went and told my boss about it. He was excited for me, but also really sad for the company. He loved having me around and so did all my co-workers. I told him I'd do all I could to make sure whoever took my place didn't miss a beat and fit in perfectly. I had been training the new person for a couple of weeks and it was nearing my final week there. The girl I was training had suddenly had an issue with the computer in her office and wanted me to help her. I had other tasks to do that my boss gave me to finish up on the last few days I was there, but I figured she needed me more since she sounded really stressed. I stay with her for hours and we ended up calling IT to fix it. He said it would take a few hours and the trainee asked if I wanted to get lunch since we had time to kill. So we started to leave and everyone was in the hallway with balloons and streamers for my going away party. I was so shocked and surprised! I couldn't believe that anyone would do something like that for me! I ended up crying! I had never felt so loved by people. It made it even harder to leave, but I do love them all!"
