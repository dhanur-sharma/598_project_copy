        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was looking into finances and how to become more financially fit. I decided  to run a full credit report on myself, especially since it was free. To my surprise, I found close to $15,000 in credit card debt.  I had no idea about and that was not actually mine. I called the credit card company that the report said the credit cards were with to report fraud. The credit card company  then told me payments have been made, which means it probably was not someone random and to check with family and friends first. After this, I then discovered that it was my own parent who had opened two credit cards in my name and maxed them out. I was so upset and in shock. I felt betrayed, frustrated, upset, and like I didn't know who to trust anymore. i could not believe a parent would do this to their own child. I was then made to feel guilt tripped over it and that I should own it. I forced them to figure out a way to pay it off in a certain time frame. I am unsure how they managed that, but they did. I had to threaten them with legal action if it was not paid by the given date. Fortunately, it did not come to this."
