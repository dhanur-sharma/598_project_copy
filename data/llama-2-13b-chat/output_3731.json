        "Summarize the following story in first person: 01/31/2019 -  I received a beautiful photo card of the bride and groom with a save the date request for their wedding. 02/17/2019 - The family members who live in town met for a family day outing to discuss who would be in the wedding and the responsibilities each person had. 03/31/2019 - My family had a reunion cook-out where we all gathered and continued to make plans for the wedding.  A cousin who lives in New Jersey came to the cook-out and was asked to be the disc jockey for the wedding. 4/19/2019 - The bride's sister got married on this date.  She mentioned at this time that she would be officiating at her sister's wedding in June.  Another cousin announced that he and his wife would be renewing their marriage in August.  They were planning a full wedding and reception for their 30th anniversary. 4/30/2019 - We received the official wedding date via a wedding invitation by mail.  The wedding would take place on June 22, 2019.  We were also informed at this time that the wedding would take place outside. 5/11/2019 - A dinner party was held for my cousin's upcoming wedding in June.  She did this instead of having a bridal shower since it was going to be her 4th marriage. 5/31/2019 - My mother, sister and I shopped for our dresses to wear to the ceremony. 6/21/2019 - The wedding party met for the rehearsal and then later went out for dinner. 6/22/2019 - We attended the wedding which turned out so beautiful in the garden setting.  There was no need to have flowers as the backdrop provided all that was needed and it turned out to be a very nice day too.   We all enjoyed ourselves for the reception dinner after the wedding photos were taken.  A great time was had by everyone."
