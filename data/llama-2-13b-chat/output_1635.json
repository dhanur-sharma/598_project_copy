        "Summarize the following story in first person: My father in law had cancer 3 years ago so he closed down his Chinese restaurant in town, the only one and surrounding 8 towns for 27 years.  He hired local agents (small and big) to sell this commercial property for 2 years.  Last year, he asked me to help him since he did not have any luck with the local agents.  It was heart broken to see the closed restaurant where a lot of fun memories there. I was not trained to sell but I wanted to find the right one to continue our family business there. My father in law did not know he signed exclusive contracts with the 2 local agents. Something I will never done.  I refused to sign another contract with anyone,  instead I posted on Zillow \"For sale by owner\", I also put a AD on Chinese Newspapers and Websites since the end of last year, showed a dozen of interested parties. No one is brave enough to do all the update and re-open the Chinese restaurant. A month ago, I saw this young couple (one Asian and one White) in a Asian supermarket, they were loading what they brought into their SUV.  I  noticed many stickers on the back side of their car, all the Natural State Parks.  I walked over and said \"I think I have a place you might be interested...\" .  To my surprise, they called me back 5 hours later and wanted to go to see the place.  We agreed the coming Saturday, we went and they offered right after. A month later, we closed the deal.  Our family tradition will passing on the next generation.  The only Chinese restaurant in Bristol, NH next to Newfound Lake."
