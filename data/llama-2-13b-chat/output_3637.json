        "Summarize the following story in first person: I remember watching this video on YouTube about somebody adopting their child. This was their final day in court, they were going to finalize the process after adopting the child and living with him for about 6 months. Before he cut into the final cut of being inside the court he gave a back story about how he grew up with adopted siblings and met his girlfriend who also grew up with adopted siblings as well. How they started dating and ended up together and after having a child of their own, they now wanted to adopt another child. I remember my eyes starting to get watery because this was a beautiful story and I asked myself If I could see myself adopting a child. Having a child and adopting one and caring and loving him as if he was my own. Caring and loving him as much as I love and care for my own child, and to be honest I couldn't get myself to answer the question. I was dealing with depression, feeling alone and left out so I decided to leave this question to answer another day. This was 10 years ago. I have told my girlfriend this story before and about five months ago, she surprised me with taking about wanting to adopt a child. This honestly brought me to tears and to be honest at this point in time, I have never loved her more. We have had some rough patches between us in the past but I think that has all settled now. This is not an easy decision, infact its nerve wracking but I hope we will get through with it. This was five months ago and we are now going through the process of adopting a child. Am supper nervous, I don't know how this is going to end but one thing that I know for sure is that I am in a better place of loving, caring for and accepting people into my life. I hope to get a wonderful child that I'll help raise into this world, and I hope that it all turns out well."
