        "Summarize the following story in first person: I decided I was done with renting, and ready to buy my own home. I love the city where I live and wanted to settle down permanently. It turns out that everyone else loved my city too, because houses were flying off the market. You had to be quick in making an offer. I spent a year putting in offers on houses that I thought were the one. It wasn't until I found my dream house, that I decided to take some extra action. I figured it was worth a shot, and decided to contact the home owners by letter. I told them about how I imagined raising a family there. I wrote about how I dreamed of having children and pushing them on the old tire swing in the front yard. I must have pulled one of their heart strings because they accepted my offer. There was even a higher, more desirable offer but they went with mine. I was so excited to get the news. I will be moving in next week. This house already feels full of love. I can't believe I am finally a home owner!"
