        "Summarize the following story in first person: Well, I was actually hoping to not have to revisit this story/event, but I guess I will.  It happened a couple months ago.  My beloved dog, Aby, died on my bed in front of me as I was about to give him lunch.  I had been nursing him for six months prior.  I'd given him drips and vitamins and home-cooked his meals.  I took him to various vets and to my disgust most of them were like \"Well, he's 20, what do you expect?\" routine.  Talk about terrible medicine.  But I did my best for him under the circumstances.  I could not afford an MRI though at his age/condition it might've killed  him.  I guess I feel good with him knowing I went the distance for him.  Some people told me to kill him.  I never do that.  I hope he knew that I would've done anything and everything for him.  I think he did.  He was my souldog.  I'll never have another like him.  I'll probably never adopt again.  But I had him and was so lucky to have known and met him.  I'll always miss him dearly.  I guess the most memorable part was just having him all those years."
