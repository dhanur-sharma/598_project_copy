        "Summarize the following story in first person: Today, I went to Def con it was my first time going. I wasn't sure what to expect seeing it wasn't me that is totally into tech like my husband and brother. But I was surprised by the support of this community. When you think of hackers you think of these bad guys who get into trouble but this wasn't the case. Instead I learned how to protect myself, make a  hunny pot, and find out how to track down people like in a kidnapping case find their last location and also find out who else was in that area at that time using gps. Overall I had a great time. We also went to a furry party, that was well not what I expected. I figured everyone would be dressed up as well furry people but it was just a normal party. I had a great time it was a well needed vacation. We also went to the 801 party and that one well was just like out of the movie hangover. tons of random stuff going on. Fighting t-rex's flying aliens, and eventually getting kicked out. We also tried Stivia weed gummies this was the first time we have ever done that. It was well interesting but I can tell you that one gummy was more than enough I should have just taken a half. Overall this was a fantastic vacation."
