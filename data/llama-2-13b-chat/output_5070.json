        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 3 months ago I went out to a bar with some friends. We stayed at the bar for most of the night. Throughout the night, I drank a lot, and got very drunk. In my drunken state, I decided that I should walk home. I lived close enough to the bar that it would be about a 20 minute walk home. On the way walking home, I tripped over a place where the concrete slabs were uneven. I fell to my right, and into a chain link fence, in front of the house on my street. As I stood back up, I could feel a lot of pain in my arm, and as I reached up I could feel blood on that part of my arm. I couldn't really see the cut since it was dark on the street, but I figured I must have scrapped my upper arm along a sharp piece of the fence. I held the cut and continued on quickly to my house, as it was bleeding quite a lot. I got inside, went to the bathroom and examined my arm. I was shocked by the amount of blood on my shirt, as I pulled it off. There was a lot of blood and the cut was quite deep. I did my best to wash my cut in the sink, before deciding to just use the shower instead, I washed the cut as well as I could and grabbed a towel, which I held very tightly to the cut. After holding the towel to my arm for about 15 to 20 minutes, the bleeding had slowed but not stopped. I replaced the towel with some clean paper towels, and held them tightly for another 10 minutes. Since I still couldn't get the bleeding to stop, I decided that I might need to go to the hospital. So I got some new paper towels, made a thick pad, and covered the cut, wrapped it in an ace bandage, put on a new clean shirt and called a lyft to go to the nearest hospital. When I got to the emergency room, I told the nurse what had happened, and filled out a lot of paperwork. Eventually I got to see a doctor, who looked at the cut, and decided I needed stitches. I got 5 stitches, and a tetanus shot, since I was cut by outdoor, probably dirty metal. After getting treated at the hospital, I went back home, quickly cleaned the bathroom as best I could, and went to bed."
