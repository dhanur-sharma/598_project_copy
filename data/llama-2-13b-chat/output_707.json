        "Summarize the following story in first person: Almost 6 months ago i received a phone call from my mother. She had just gotten back from the hospital and my grandmother was diagnosed with cancer. They said it was pretty severe and weren't sure how long she had. It was lung cancer. My grandmother was a avid smoker since she was a young girl. Time went on with my grandmother receiving treatment of what they could do for her. It took a lot of her energy away. She no longer was able to do much. I spent my weekends going to see her or taking her to her appointments. Then about a month ago i received the call. She had passed away during the night. Upset i had to call out of work so i could try to deal with my feelings. Arrangements were made for the following week to have her funeral. A lot of family and friends showed up to give their respect. She then was buried near her house, not even a mile from it."
