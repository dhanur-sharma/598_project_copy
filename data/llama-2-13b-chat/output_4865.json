        "Summarize the following story in first person: Recently I attended my son's middle school graduation. it was moving for me to go because he is our oldest and i am so very proud of him. He had worked so hard in his AP classes and made his entire middle school time look effortless. I sat in the auditorium with my husband and watched him walk across that stage in his green gown. He looked so tall and strong. it was crazy to think that just 15 years ago he was small enough to sit on my lap and now he is closer to his adult life than he is to being a baby. I don't know what he will end up doing but I am sure whatever he does he will be successful at it. I remember watching him at the ceremony and thinking of his first day of kindergarten.  He seemed so little but brave. My husband was sitting next to me and as we held hands I thought about how special our family was and how lucky I was to be a part of this life. There was a slide show at the end of the performance and we were all surprised that the teacher who had made it had gone back through past school years and found pictures of the kids from kindergarten through 8th grade. I was shocking to see how grown up they all looked now. Some of the kids were unrecognizable. Some of the kids look like they hadn't changed a bit, just growing taller. It was wonderful to look at all of the friends groups throughout the years and see that almost all of them were still in tact. I thought about what it will be like for all of them in the future."
