        "Summarize the following story in first person: Recently, I went on a trip with my partner to Japan and Korea. We were there to see the countries but also to visit with his sister and soon to be son in law. We first stopped in Tokyo, because I was excited to go to Tokyo DisneySea. I was blown away by the cleanliness of the park, the friendlieness, and just the general kindness of the people around us. While on vacation in Japan, we went to a spa with my sister-in law and her boyfriend. The spa was completed gender separated, the girls and the boys were not able to bathe together because you were expected to go into the hot spring nude. I was struck by the thought that I would have to be in front of my sister in law naked and how many other women. I worried about my body, my hair, my fat the entire train ride up into the mountains. But once, we got there, and I was in my robe waiting to go into the water, I stopped caring. I was quick to adjust and accept that was what was going to happen. The first time I went in I thought it was like a soak that you would do in a hot tub. I was wrong, very wrong. It was more like a spa experience where you are expected to do temperature treatments in the water. Going back and forth between hot and cold while you clean/scrub your body. I felt great afterward, my skin was so soft. I quickly became comfortable with my body and it wasn\u2019t an issue. I was self-conscious but accepted that my body is my body and it isn\u2019t going to change in the next hour. It was an emotional experience because during that time that my sister in law and I were in the water we got to talk and I thought really get to know one another. We hadn\u2019t seen each other much since we were living in different countries and it was a great experience to spend together. It was great to have such a personal experience of accepting my body with another strong confident women beside me. We talked about our body insecurities and over coming them together. For a girl that has always been big this was a major moment in my life."
