        "Summarize the following story in first person: I attended the memorial service of a remarkable young woman. She was responsible for securing funds which enabled many students to go to college, when they otherwise would not be able to do so. She was fearless and tireless in her pursuit of funds to help underprivileged students. She was a joy to everyone she worked with and worked for at the university for more than 10 years. So much so that the chancellor of the university spoke during her celebration of life service. She had recently reluctantly accepted another position with a university in Atlanta, GA. She had only worked for the university for four months, when she died suddenly from an aneurysm. Needless to say her family, friends and colleagues were shocked and saddened by her untimely death. The university where she worked for 10 plus years wanted to honor her, and so the family held the celebration of life service on the university's campus. There were many in attendance and the auditorium was filled and many had to be directed to an overflow room. She was a member of my church and I know her family well, so I wanted to be in attendance. Our church choir was requested to sing. There were remarks by many of her friends, family and co-workers. The one story that was heart-wrenching and tugged at the heart strings of all in attendance was the recounting of her last day spent with the new dean who was her boss at the university in Atlanta. She told how the young woman and herself had attended a meeting. She said that she spent her last day doing what she did best, which was to secure a donor for the university. She also said that she was happy and it was a sunny day. They had taken a selfie together and sent the photo to several people. Her recounting of the young lady's last day was filled with funny stories, as the dean spoke to the tenacity of the young woman in securing funds for the school. She was part of a sorority and her sorority sisters gave a poignant tribute to her. It is a celebration of life service I will remember for a long time to come."
