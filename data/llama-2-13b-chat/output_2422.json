        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 7 weeks ago I decided I would do something insane. I called up my parents who have been divorced for 3 years now, and invited them on a trip to Ft. Lauderdale.  I didn't tell the them that the other was going to be there. They were caught completely by surprise. I pulled a parent trap. My intentions were noble. They had both been alone now since their divorce, they weren't happy. I thought that if they just could remember what it was like to be together, especially after trying to date in the modern world, that they would want to get back together. At first they were resistant. When we all arrived they felt betrayed and both wanted to leave. But I convinced them that we were all adults, and we could all have a good time. They stayed for me. The trip was 5 days long, and on the 3rd day, I saw something incredible. My parents were at the beach holding and kissing each other.  I couldn't believe that my plan actually worked. They are still seeing each other now. I don't know if they'll get married again, but they sure are happy."
