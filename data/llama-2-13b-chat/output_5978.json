I got a big fish. He got a little fish. We both hiked up a hill. We saw the lovely sunset on the hill. He decided to do something unexpected. He proposed to me while the sun was setting. It was very romantic. I said yes and we will get married in December. It will take some time planning the wedding. I hope to look my best when the occasion arises. I hope we both look good at the wedding. I will definitely be sending wedding cards to everybody who is invited."
