        "Summarize the following story in first person: It's been a while, but today I can't seem to keep thinking about an interaction with an elderly gentleman about 2 months ago. I distinctly remember this man, he came in to the store and tipped his hat and smiled at me, and I had seen him before several times. There was nothing out of the ordinary at all, except he did dress as though it were still the 1950s. I interacted a few times with the man, as he had several questions about products on the floor and generally probing for the best product for his house (I can't recall exactly). He enjoyed asking me questions, and always struck up good conversation when he came in. As I was helping this gentlemen find what he was looking for, a woman a few aisles over made a distinct shriek that can only be described as a horrible gasp for help. The man dropped the product he was holding and ran to find out what was going on. I had to follow. I ran several aisles down, and the man was overtop of the woman, stabilizing telling people to call 911. I called the ambulance while the man performed some chest compressions and was directing other store employees to help him in any way they could. The man completely took over, and when the ambulance came, the swiftly took her away. The man left quickly afterward, seemingly exhausted, but the police that stayed after to file a report told me that the EMTs notified them that the woman was stable and that the man's actions may have saved her life, at least for now. Well, today, the exact woman came today and I recognized her instantly. She was looking for information on the man who saved her life, and I felt a great deal of sadness in telling her I did not know who he was. She left looking a bit dejected, and I felt for her, as this man was the window between life and death for her, and he was gone as quickly as he came. Boy, do I wish I could have one more conversation with him."
