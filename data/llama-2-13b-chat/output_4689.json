        "Summarize the following story in first person: So I'm going to tell you about an experience I had with my girlfriend. This event took place about 2 months ago. We went to a theme park that's not too far from our house. Only about an hour and a half away, not that bad! And we didn't really know exactly what we were going to do. I know she mentioned she wanted to hit up the roller coasters. And I definitely wanted to go on the go-karts! We got there and there was quite a few people there. We got to the roller coaster line and it was pretty long and she could see I didn't really want to stand around. She's awesome and said well let's so check the go-kart line maybe we can come back to the roller coaster later. So we went to the go-karts and the line was also pretty long! Unfortunately she also didn't want to wait in line. So since she was just so understanding I returned the favor and said well let's go find something to do that doesn't have a long line! And we found there was a spot we could get on a creek and kayak! Cool, we hadn't done this before. So you get in the creek and then a couple miles down the creek theres a spot where you get off and they give you a ride back to the park! We really enjoyed it and had so much fun that we didn't even bother going on any of the other rides, we went home so happy! SO MUCH FUN! LOOKING FORWARD TO DOING IT AGAIN!"
