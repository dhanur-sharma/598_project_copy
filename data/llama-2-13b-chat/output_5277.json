        "Summarize the following story in first person: A few days ago the weather outside Colorado got below 30.  It was surprising since the last few days were in the upper 70s.  The start of that morning was rough. I had to wake up around 5am to get ready for a day that didn't have sunrise yet. The whole day was filled with delays and problems due to the cold temperature. The snow came rolling down the mountains only after I waited an extra ten minutes for my usual bus. The bus lost traction en route to my work and slide across four lanes of traffic, and I didn't wear enough layer to stop the cold. On my way home, I remembered I had a fireplace and some wood I had been saving for just an occasion like this. I made myself some hot soup and pulled down and old blanket before starting a fire. Only after lighting the kindling, I realized my dog never experienced one before. For the first hour, she ran away from it, but quickly changed interest by the warmth.  The two of us cuddle as I ate and watched the fire. After a long day, I really enjoyed the warmth of the fire, the soft crackles as the wood turned to ash, and the mellowness my restless dog found in the the fireplace. It was a good way to end a hectic day. I enjoyed it a lot."
