        "Summarize the following story in first person: Well, that was unexpected. Just walking down the street minding my own business when this guy almost pounced on me. I had not noticed him on the street and he seemed to appear out of nowhere; he literally grabbed me by the arm and almost yelled something like \"Oh my God, you didn't change one bit! What are you doing here!?\"  I was really surprised, completely taken aback actually, trying to figure out if I actually knew the guy or if he was just some random bozo trying to make contact. He started asking me about people I did not know. But it was very vague. Like, \"Have you seen Bob again?\" And I couldn't see who he was talking about. Eventually he realized I was not recognizing him and, once again almost yelling, told me he was my cousin Michael. And then I could see that he was indeed. But he had changed a lot. The last time I had seem him he was probably 19 or 20, thin as reed, with long curly blond hair. I was now staring at a portly bald guy with thick glasses and a manic grin on his face. Still, it was him alright and since I was curious, I accepted his offer to go and grab a cup of coffee together, right then and there. Once we were seated in a cafe he calmed down and started acting more normally. So we talked about what we were doing now, how our families had been at war without our generation understanding why it was we couldn't hang out together anymore.  (We still don't know to this day why our parents suddenly decided to break all ties with his parents). And we spoke of our current lives. He lives in Germany now and was visiting New York. The more he was telling me about himself the more I realized he was somewhat of hermit, someone who kept away from other people out of misanthropy. Among other things, he told me he had a son, who had just had a baby, so he was \"technically\" a grandfather. The \"technically\" made me laugh and I asked him why he was using that term. He told me his son had totally cut ties with him. And he told me it was better that way, that anyway he didn't really like his son. The least I can say is that it was an interesting conversation. And that I'm glad he lives faraway."
