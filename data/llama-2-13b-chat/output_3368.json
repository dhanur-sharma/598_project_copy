        "Summarize the following story in first person: One day in late June the gas company rang my doorbell. \"There is a slight gas leak under the sidewalk in front of your property,\" he said. \"We discovered it May 31st. A crew will come do the repair around July 15th.\" My eyebrow went up. He saw it, and added, \"it's a very, very small leak, so it's ok to wait. We use a machine that can detect parts per million. Yours is something like 5 parts per million.\" Should I trust them? This gas company was the one responsible for the San Bruno explosion in 2010, and also the Northern California wildfires last year. This company is bankrupt and owes something like $20 billion. Maybe they are being more proactive now in looking for leaks to avoid more lawsuits. But should I trust them? What option do I have? I'm no expert. July 15th was a long time to wait. Would I get blown up if Fourth Of July fireworks set off the gas? No, no, he assured me. This guy seemed to know what he was doing. Ok, I'll wait. The following week the little colored flags were planted to mark the gas lines, electric lines, phone lines, cable TV line, and water pipe, very colorful to match the American flags on Independence Day. Tick tock. Tick tock. Nerves were just beneath the surface. Finally the day came, and they showed up in force with several huge trucks with digging equipment. It took them from 8:30 am till 8 pm to plug the leak. Sigh of relief all around."
