        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last week I invited some friends of mine to attend a class on love and yoga. During the class we began discussing the meaning of love, how it manifests itself in relationships and how it is seen within the universe. One of the things about the class that impressed me was the teacher's clarity that love is undefined and unconditioned. nit does not fluctuate much like the human conception, but instead it is a powerful force that can be said formed the universe. After the class we all had a chance to talk and converse what was shared. My friends were overjoyed that I would invite them to such a program because it was something that touched the hearts of all of us. Some people felt love was like An ocean in which we all swam or floated or drowned. Others felt that love was like a tree that ascended towards the heavens and humbled itself deep into the earth. Then there were some that felt love was a hummingbird that sought nectar from all of life. I could not help but agre with all three sentiments and feel that love takes many forms. some of these forms are seen in relationships between two people. Another form is between a parent and a child. There is also the form of love between friends which is most equal. There also exists a form of love between a teacher and a student. One can also see love between animals that care for their young or their mate. Love appears in many forms indeed. My feeling is that it's best to express rather to repress ones love. It's best to follow ones love."
