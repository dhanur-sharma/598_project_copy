        "Summarize the following story in first person: I entered myself in a big trail running race.  It was a marathon with over a mile of elevation gain and then another elevation of descent.  It took place on steep rugged mountain trails and over boulder fields.  I had never done that distance before and was a little nervous.  I had only done about 16 miles before at a single time.  I trained hard and smart for the event and did carb loading, etc.  I wasn't quite sure if I could do it, but I wanted to push my limits.  I started off taking my time and made good progress.  I was easily beating all the cut off times by hours.  About halfway through, while climbing up the toughest part of the race, my right leg went numb.  I literally couldn't move.  i couldn't drag it, pick it up or anything.  I took some salt tablets, got it moving again and kept going.  I  took extra care of my nutrition during the race of my rest and didn't have any problems after that.  I was running at the end and could have done more if I needed to.  I had a blast and easily beat the end cut off time by many hours!"
