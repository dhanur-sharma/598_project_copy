        "Summarize the following story in first person: On the 18th of June 2019 was a very memory day in my life, it was one or probably the best birthday that I have ever had I got much love from friends and familyMy friends gave my giftsthere was much drinks for every onethere were lots of good musicthere were lots of ladies that made it funthere was lots of foodI got lots of prayers from peopleMy dad gave me a new house on this daymy brother got me a new car on this houseI proposed to my wife on this dayI was poured water as a sign of birthday wishesI invited all my ex girl friends and introduced them to my wifeMy friend surprised me with a checkJamie my friend took lots of alcohol that he fell on his way homeJamie spoilt his car when he was going home due to lots of alcohol I always feel very special and happy and I wouldn't change any of it. I remembered.  that on the night before my birthday, I was crying because I can't find one of my dolls. I get mad at everybody because it is one of my favorite dolls and I've looked everywhere and it's still missing. However, the next day I was so surprised that it is on top of my  birthday cake as part of the decorations. That really brings smiles to my face and I am not only enjoying my birthday but i also felt relieve that I have my old car back. I will never forget those moments and now, every time my birthday is coming and one of my doll is missing. One of the  gift that I have ever given to someone would most likely be the gift I gave to my dad on his fiftieth birthday. I figured it would be special to surprise him on his birthday. My brother and I had a few ideas in mind. My father had wanted these golf clubs, a watch, and other costly purchases, but we only had a limited budget. We finally decided to fix him a surprise dinner that we would put together. I knew he would like something unexpected for a change. Especially, if it was something that me and my brother had came together to do on our own. Since it was a surprise we could not let anybody know, not even mom."

He was very surprised and he loved the dinner. He said it was the best birthday gift he ever received. It was nice to see him smile and be so happy. I also enjoyed spending that time with my brother. It was a special bonding time for us. My dad had always taught me that it is the thought that counts and not the price of the gift. I remember when I was a child, he would always make sure that I knew he loved me no matter what. He would give me a hug and a kiss and tell me that he loved me. He would also tell me that he was proud of me and that I could do anything that I set my mind to. I will always cherish those memories and the special bond that we shared. I am so grateful for the gift of life and the ability to experience such joy and happiness. I will always be grateful for my dad and the sacrifices he made for me. I will always be grateful for my brother and the love and support he has given me."
