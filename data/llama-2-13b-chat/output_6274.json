        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was my daughters 14th birthday party and i wanted it to be one that she would remember since this year was a roller-coaster of a year.  I spent an entire week cleaning the backyard and building  an area where her and her friends could relax . The theme was a movie night along with sleeping outside. I had build an L-shaped couch with air mattresses for them to sit. A table full of snacks, candies, and soda where all set. The tent was up , with even a fridge added inside. We allowed the girls to purchase two movies to watch , whatever they wanted.  This was of course after the pizza , cake and presents were done. Then they headed outside. I can recall just hearing them laugh and being typical teenage girls. I wont ever forget that night since i was exhausted from preparing everything . But especially since the girls never went to bed! My bedroom was right near the tent so i heard them all night. I specifically recall them at 6 am saying there was donuts inside. As they ran to the front door i jumped out of bed and ran as well . Since a stampede of teenage girls were about to raid my kitchen. Overall , the girls ate there donuts and one by one went home. It was a success and i made it throught the whole ordeal . But its definitely one i will remember. the giggling of teenage girls all night and the hard work i put forth in doing it was all worth it in the end."
