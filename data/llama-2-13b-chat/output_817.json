        "Summarize the following story in first person: I have been living in a nightmare. It all started about 3 months ago when I took my doggo Pips to the local dog park. After running around with her for about 15  minutes, I noticed that Pips slowing down. She took a couple of breaks before quitting and sat down for a rest. Now this was a little odd because Pips has been an active dog since a pup. I call Pips up and tell her to fetch me her favorite toy bunny. After looking at me and the her toy she gets up slowly, I notice that she's arching her back in a weird way and limps to the toy. At that moment, I could have kicked myself because that wasn't my dog. Pips was hurting and my guilt rose quickly because being her momma, I should have noticed it as soon as she sat down the first time. But Pips being the people pleaser she was, obeyed my command. It was that moment when I made a call to our Vet where I was told to bring Pips first thing in the morning. When we arrived at the vet, the Doctor did the usual checks and vitals. The doctor claimed it was some kind of back injury and prescribed Pips some pain meds and suggested some weird exercises and stretches to do with her. I was told that the I would be called for a follow up soon.  It's been 4 weeks and no calls or answers from the doctor. Pips has lost weight and the pain meds have ran out. I tried the exercises and Pips howls out in pain! We can't sleep and I cannot bare to see Pips in pain anymore! I have to carry her everywhere and I have already missed too many days at work! I am currently looking for another vet I can trust. If I don't, I have no clue what will happen to Pips. I just want her to be okay so I can have my silly, hyper puppy back."
