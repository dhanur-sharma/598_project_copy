        "Summarize the following story in first person: My boyfriend and I had lived together for over five years, We had talked about getting engaged and getting married but we just were not getting around to it. I was pretty specific about the kind of ring I wanted. I didn't want anything really large I just had specific styles in mind. My boyfriend came into a little extra money. It was not a huge amount but enough to made a decent purchase. I woke up one morning and he was already out of bed which was not unusual. I got up and came to the living room. He approached me, got down on one knee, and asked me to marry him. The ring was perfect and of course I said yes. I was so happy. He had obviously been paying attention to my desires involving an engagement ring even though he knows nothing about jewelry which means a lot to me. He had to have done a lot of research. He even made sure the quality was good rather than just the style. I'm thrilled to be engaged to him. I can't wait to marry him."
