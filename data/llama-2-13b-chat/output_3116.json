        "Summarize the following story in first person: A little over three months ago, my husband, of over 30 years, suffered an injury at work.  He suffered multiple fractures in his shoulder.  It was my worst nightmare come true.   My husband has worked two jobs for as long as we were together.  We have had a lot of difficulties in our marriage.  It has only lasted for as long as it has because he was always working.  I have made my own life and was happy with how I had structured my life.  He has been out on worker\u2019s compensation for over 3 months and it has changed my entire life or life, as I have lived it.  He has been home every day, for the first month in a sling.  He couldn\u2019t do much of anything and he has tried my patience, to the extent that I can\u2019t stand it or him.  After a month, he went to physical therapy, which left me even more frustrated.  He didn\u2019t follow the therapist\u2019s recommendations, to do exercises at home.  We would get into bitter feuds about it.  It reminded me of the early days of our marriage, where frustration ruled the day.  He refuses to listen to reason and I feel I have nowhere to turn, to get away from his craziness.  His behavior brings me back to very dark place. When he worked two jobs, I rarely saw him and that worked for me.  I try to take life, day by day, but its been so difficult for me.  I have realized that I have essentially been in this relationship by myself and that we literally have nothing, but our love of our dogs, in common.  It\u2019s a really sad revelation but his being home, has all brought it to the forefront and is making me question my entire life."
