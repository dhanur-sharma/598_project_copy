        "Summarize the following story in first person: I went on a rock cruise with three of my girlfriends a few months ago. One of my friends had posted a youtube video from last year's and another friend commented that she really wanted to go on it sometime so I replied that if she was serious we should plan it because I really wanted to as well. The two of us, the original friend who posted it and another friend of theirs were able to get a quad cabin and go. I wasn't sure what to expect and was a little nervous about what to pack or what the experience would be like. I have gone to lots of concerts for year and I always am happy and comfortable at rock concerts. From the time we got on the boat I felt at home and like I was meant to be there. The first night of the cruise one of the bands I was most interested in seeing was doing a performance in a pretty small lobby area so I made sure to get there early so I could get a spot; I was able to get a spot on the stairs looking down on the stage and the performance was nothing less than chill inducing. You could feel the passion in their performance and everyone watching was locked in enjoying it. At one point the singer said that they were just a bunch of Texas boys used to sitting around a campfire with an acoustic guitar and beers and singing, he and one of the guitarists went and sat on the bar and did what turned into a singalong of a classic rock song. Everyone in that lobby area all the way up to the balconies looking down was signing along. I felt at home and actually teared up at what a special moment it was. Throughout the cruise we would run into band members all over the place; in the dining hall, at the ports, in the casino, just hanging out and they were all nice as could be.  I left my phone in my cabin most of the time and wasn't even concerned with taking photos or videos of performances, I just lived in the moment. I stood and talked with band members of bands who I have been a fan of for years and they seemed to have a genuine interest in what we were talking about, I got to meet people I never would have dreamed of meeting and I discovered some new bands. Since the cruise ended I bought a meet and greet for one of the bands when they were in my town and I mentioned that we \"vacationed together\" and all of them lit up talking about the experience. One of the members of the band had been sitting behind me with his girlfriend at a comedy show and I offered to buy them drinks, just because I'm a fan and appreciate what their music has gotten me through and done for me. With no prompting, he looked at me and said, \"Wait. I remember you, you bought me a beer! My girlfriend and I really appreciated that!\" and we had more of a conversation about the cruise. I figured I would have a good time and I always wanted to go on this cruise because it is very popular in the rock community. I had an even better time than I imagined I would. I walked around the entire time with a smile on my face and I am going back next year!"
