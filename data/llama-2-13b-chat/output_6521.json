        "Summarize the following story in first person: Two weeks ago I achieved my dream of finally attending the Boston Fan Expo. It was my first time and although I had read about the event, nothing could have prepared me for how much fun it was. One event in particular really stood out. There was a guy dressed in a professional level Hulk Buster Iron Man suit complete with lights and everything. He was surrounded by people admiring his costume and folks requesting selfies, me being one of them i'm not ashamed to admit. While I was standing there next to this giant Iron Man costume getting my selfie, a little girl, no more than 7 years old, stepped out from the perimeter of interested fans. She stepped forward with two foam Hulk fists on her hands, both toy fists nearly as big as she, and proclaimed \"HULK SMASH!\". The crowd bursted into laughter, as did I. As I stepped out of the way, the little girl pounced forward and began punching the Iron Man's leg with her foam fists. The man in the Iron Man outfit, being a good sport, decided to put on a show and duke it out with the little She Hulk. I was able to catch the action on my cell phone but of course the video was shaky due to my uncontrollable laughter. After the staged fight I stepped aside to reflect on the brawl I had witnessed and it got me to thinking. I started thinking about my own life and how this event is such a strong metaphor to my day to day. I am just one small person in a whole wide world, fighting against injustices, prejudice, and those telling me I won't ever achieve my dreams, yet this little girl so clearly showed that no matter your size or position in life, you can overcome the greatest of obstacles. I will always remember this day, the setting of the amazing Boston Fan Expo, and the little girl who not only made my day, but inspired me to recognize the strength I possess."
