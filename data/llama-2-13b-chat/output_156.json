        "Summarize the following story in first person: I am hoping I made the right decision, but I recently moved from my home state to Texas.  My girlfriend has been living in Houston for the past 3 years.  I love her but it is very tough to remain in a long term relationship for that long.  I am from Colorado, and loved it there.  It was alot of work to move a whole house several states away.  I have been stressed non-stop, between orchestrating the movers and rental trucks.  I had to pack up the entire house alone, and ended up selling some items, as there was no more space on the truck.  I was so worried about the overage charges that I have heard those movers charge when you have mores things then you are supposed to.  My cat is older, and I didn't want to stress him with the relocation, so I had to let him stay with my family back in Denver.  That was one of the hardest parts of this move.  Then when I got to my girlfriends place, she has a cat.  And it hates me, almost as much as I dislike him.  I followed the truck over 12 hours, driving throughout the night.  I was so tired.  When I finally made it to Houston, I had to unpack all these boxes.  It is so awkward, when you show up with all of your personal effects to move in with someone , even if you were already dating.  I was moving into her territory.  I couldn't find my toothbrush, and bathroom supplies for over 3 weeks.  Figures, it was the very last box that I unpacked."

I have been feeling really lonely, even though I am living with my girlfriend.  I miss my family and my old home.  I hope that this move will be good for us in the long run.  I hope that I can find a job here, and start to put down some roots.  I am still trying to get used to the heat and humidity here.  I am not sure if I will ever get used to it.  I am still trying to figure out this whole living in Texas thing.  I am hoping that I made the right decision, but I am still unsure."
