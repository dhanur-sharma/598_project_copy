        "Summarize the following story in first person: About two months ago, I was chosen to be featured in Woman's World magazine. The story was about my amazing weight loss journey. Approximately 4 years ago, I was nearly 400 pounds and in extremely bad health. Because of my extreme obesity and sedentary lifestyle, I was putting a lot of strain on my heart and developed many ailments due to my condition and the shape that I was in. The most distressing was my diagnosis of congestive heart failure. My heart was not functioning problem because of the huge amount of weight that I was carrying. I also suffered from hypertensive, sleep apnea, irregular heart beat and chronic muscle and joint pain. I was extremely depressed and receiving this diagnosis made matters even worse. My cardiologist informed me that my heart was on the brink of completely giving out and I was put on blood thinners to help protect me from stokes and blood clots. Because of the blood thinners, weight loss surgery was risky and not recommended. To top things off, I had a sluggish thyroid which meant that my metabolism was not working effectively either, making weight loss almost impossible. My only option was to hold on to my faith in God and push past the barriers before me. The first thing that I did was change my eating habits. I chose a complete lifestyle change, one that I could live with for the rest of my life. I avoided high carb foods and sugary sweets and instead ate plenty of fruit and vegetables. I did internet research looking for healthy choices that would help me achieve my goals. I chose low carbs as opposed to no carbs because I knew this was a lifestyle change. I also ate plenty of protein, starting each day off with eggs and turkey breakfast sausages. I had healthy salads for lunch with a bowl of delicious homemade soup, packed with ingredients that helped boost my metabolism naturally. Dinner was lean protein, healthy vegetables, a huge salad and fresh fruit for dessert. I notices rapid results and soon I was able to begin walking. I started off slow and worked my way up to 2 miles each day. It took me about 4 years but I was able to lose 200 pounds and have kept it off. Woman's World magazine heart about my awesome journey through Shapefit and contacted me for a story in their magazine. I have been able to inspire so many people and I turned my health around for the better and being in the magazine was an amazing accomplishment and I look forward to having a professional photo shoot done soon for another story in the magazine."
