        "Summarize the following story in first person: August 14, 2019I can't believe Joe dumped me! Out of nowhere he texted me and said he needed a break. Can you believe he didn't even have the common courtesy to CALL ME? After a few back and forth texts he finally agreed to Facetime with me about it.  We argued and it came out he's been seeing another woman. She found out about me and has been threatening Joe that if he doesn't end his relationship with me she was going to confront me. I'm not sure how since she lives in the city where he works. But he sounded scared and convinced she was crazy enough to find a way. I don't know what to think. I'm angry and this whole situation has made me feel stupid for not seeing the signs. How could he do this to me? I thought he loved me. I feel so inadequate, especially since he chose to tell me through a text. Why do guys do crap like this? I feel like I'm not good enough for anyone right now. I need to find a way to get past this. I think I'll go shopping and try to take my mind off of it for a while. A new pair of shoes might lift my spirits."
