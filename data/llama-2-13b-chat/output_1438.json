        "Summarize the following story in first person: My wife sat me down and told me how disappointed she was. I have been slacking in the husband area and in the father areas of my life. She said she had been feeling distant from me and she was hoping that by bribing it up, wee could fix it. She was coming at me from a place of love and not anger. It made me really sad to be called out for not doing that I am supposed to be doing. I felt disappointed in myself. It lit a fire under me that I needed and wouldn't have gotten unless she had not talked to me. What is scary is that I probably would have just coasted like that until the problems in our marriage or with my kids was past fixing. I am very grateful to my wife for having the courage to approach a topic that was sensitive and do it in a way that wasn't harmful to our relationship. I feel like this was a turning point in my life. I need to stop making excuses. I need to do better. I hope that whenever I start slacking, because let's be honest, eventually it will happen. I hope that I can remember this conversation and correct course. This will be an important memory in my life moving forward."
