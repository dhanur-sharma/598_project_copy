        "Summarize the following story in first person: The proposal took place on the evening of June 18th at an Italian restaurant , A very gorgeous place near the Avila Beach, California. It was a perfect evening, the wind was calm, and the fog was nestled against the hillside below. The rolling green hills gave way to the broad expanse of the ocean. It was the very same place I had taken her when I first asked her to consider a dating me. I brought her up there under the guise of enjoying a picnic dinner and some quiet time together. Little did she know that there was so much more planned! I did have a friend that works there and he was involved in the plan. I was at the restaurant, after I placed an order for what we wanted and had a little gist and chat while there.  After we were there minutes later I told my friend to get me a Hennessy that I wanted to celebrate with my girlfriend so we did put the ring in her cup and she saw it. At this point she had a very bewildered look on her face.  I told her that I was going to be starting the process of getting her a ring, and wanted to make sure that I knew the right size. She was still a bit confused, but began to sort through the different sizes to find hers (a 5.5). To her dismay, there was no size 5.5 ring on the key chain! I pretended to be a bit confused before reaching deeper into the cup and pulling out a much smaller red Kevin Main Jewelry box. I got down on one knee, I was very much happy on that day. I already told my dad I will be proposing soon I never knew he already bought a car and was waiting for me to make my proposal official so he can unveil the car. I invited my family and friends so I can make it official and my dad gave me the car. There was so much merriment in the house that day because everyone was happy for me I was surprised when he gave me the car."
