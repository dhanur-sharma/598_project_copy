        "Summarize the following story in first person: In July  I was thinking of going out for lunch and a little bit of video poker playing. I received a text from an old friend who wanted to get together. How convenient!  After texting back and forth we decided to meet at a casino the was about half way for both of us,  I arrived before Trudi and found a machine that was not being played  that had with my favorite game . I sat down, choose my game ,put some money in the machine and began to play. Soon Trudi texted me to inform she was in the parking lot and where can she find me ,A After a few minutes we located each other and sat down at different machines to play for a little while  The machines were HOT! I hit a four of a kind within  minutes  , Trudi was doing quite well also . We were both having fun and luck was with us both. Soon I hit a Royal Flush ($1000. 00)! While the amount was adding up on my machine, Trudi hit a Royal Flush on her machine. Wow we are both on a roll ! It certainly is good when someone wins but this made the day for both of us. It made for a great lunch date for both of us.  I can only hope to be so lucky again in the future! The best part of this story is we both donated $100,00 to our favorite charity. Trudi donated to the local church that helps single Moms. I donated to the local Salvation Army to help feed the homeless. What a great feeling! I hope to have that kind of luck again soon !"
