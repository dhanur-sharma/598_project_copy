        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last month was my friend Henry's birthday. We went to the local bar that night to celebrate. I think it was a Buffalo Wild Wings, which was great because that is one of my favorite places to eat, I really love their wings. We were watching the Lakers game on one of the big screen TVs there, and just having a good time while eating some wings and also having a few drinks. The Lakers were really destroying the Clippers that night, and by the third quarter they had a 20 point lead, so our cheers and laughter only got louder. All of a sudden, in the middle of the third quarter, we saw someone on the opposite side of the bar get up angrily and began walking towards us. He had a Clippers jersey on, so we had a pretty good idea why he was so upset. He stood next to us, and told my friend specifically to shut his \"Stupid big fat mouth\". I was pretty amazed that someone could be so belligerent over a meaningless regular season NBA game, so I was speechless for a moment. Then I asked the man what his problem was and why he was so upset at the game. He told my friend and I that were just bandwagon fans, and only liked the Lakers because they traded for Anthony Davis. I told him that he was clearly drunk and should just shut up and go home. To my surprise, he actually did leave without saying much else after that. His outburst really ruined the night, though, and it made me forget that we were supposed to be celebrating my friend's birthday. Instead, I was focused on why my friend didn't stand up for himself and say anything. He just told me that he was too nervous because he didn't want to potentially get into a fight, so I left it at that and we went home afterwards."
