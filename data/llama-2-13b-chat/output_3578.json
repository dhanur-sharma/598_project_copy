        "Summarize the following story in first person: I went to my follow-up appointment with my primary care doctor last week. I was expecting a fairly regular report as I hadn't really been experiencing any particular issues. I was a bit taken aback when she informed me that I was showing red flags for prostate cancer. To get more information, she set up an appointment with a urologist that I will go to later this month after returning from my monthly business meetings. I have been ruminating on the idea and doing some research - my results are not very high, which is good but do bear investigation. I am frankly a bit scared but hopeful that things will work out. My wife is supportive which I appreciate. I have not told anyone besides her and my boss. We had the grandchildren over last Saturday to go to the county fair which was fun but I have had the news hanging in my mind. I do have a co-worker who is a survivor of this cancer. I intend to talk with him when I see him next and see what he can tell me from his experience. I don't want to alarm my friends and family until I know more. It isn't always easy to keep a normal outlook though. There is no close history on cancer in the family that I know of. I find myself worrying about things that I normally wouldn't."
