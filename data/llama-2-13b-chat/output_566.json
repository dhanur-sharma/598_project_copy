        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was at a nearby nature center with my grandkids and my partner. This was an outing to enjoy the nice weather with my grandson and granddaughter, as well as a time to show them the beauty of Lake Ontario. I am older and have minor mobility issues. When we got to the lake shore, the water was very wavy and the level was high so the strip of sand for walking was narrow. I decided to rest while the rest of the party headed up to the bluffs. I sat down on a fallen log. My granddaughter was so joyous to see the lake, which she thought was as grand as the ocean. I assumed the three of them would continue on to the bluffs. Then the most surprising thing happened. My 10 year old grandson said that he couldn't leave his granny there by herself, and he chose to sit with me. We sat for a long time talking. Afterwhile, we realized that the others should have returned, but they hadn't. Also my cellphone was dead, and I wasn't able to stand up by myself. It was so fortituous that my grandson was there with me. He found a stout stick and helped me arise so that we could find out what happened!"
