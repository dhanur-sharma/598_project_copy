        "Summarize the following story in first person: It's not exactly a surprise that being a mother takes its toll on you emotionally. I remember hearing my mother telling me that quite often when I first got pregnant. She used to always go on about how I would finally understand what she meant some day. She was totally right. All that time she actually knew what she was talking about. Now that my daughter started second grade two weeks ago I can really look back and see things clearly. Not only has my daughter changed significantly, obviously, but I am now much more equipped for the day-to-day life of being a mother and what that requires currently. In addition, some of the requirements of that task have changed in the process. Feeding and making sure my daughter didn't hurt herself were essential tasks when she was a toddler, but now in grade school the expectations of motherhood have shifted. This is what my mother always talked about and I simply brushed aside. My daughter needs me for stability and things like helping her with her math homework now, and it's a fun change for me. I'm excited to start getting into science projects and fun activities she gets to take home with her. I hope to help her and continue to show her the value of education and learning. I always loved art classes too, so it's great that she's already taken a liking to drawing and painting in her spare time. It's very fulfilling to be able to experience this part of my daughter's life, and I can't wait to see her continue to grow up and develop into a wonderful person."
