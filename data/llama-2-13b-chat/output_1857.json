        "Summarize the following story in first person: Six months ago, I had an unforgettable birthday. I know that when I say this, it sounds like I'm preparing to talk about how wonderful and perfect the day was, but it turned out to be quite the opposite experience. This was the first birthday I ever had that almost no one remembered. I know that I'm mostly to blame for this. I don't like being the center of attention, so I make sure to take my birthday reminder off of Facebook and I definitely don't mention that my birthday is coming up to friends or family. I guess I took it for granted that most people I cared about just happened to keep it locked away and ready for use when it came up every year. I think it also doesn't help that I'm not a kid anymore. Anyway, this year no one really remembered except for my girlfriend and my mom. It's easy for my girlfriend since her mom and I share the same birthday, and my mom had the traumatic experience of giving birth to me so she probably couldn't forget it even if she wanted to. I have to admit that I was disappointed to learn that neither my brothers or my closest friends hadn't remembered on their own. It stung deeply as the day came to a close, the little hope I had dwindling as time ticked on. As time has passed I've realized that it wasn't so bad. I spent the evening with my mom and had dinner with her at a restaurant (her treat, of course). We spent the time enjoying each others company and simply talking. I know it sounds typical and boring, but I treasure that memory now. I spent my birthday celebrating it with the one person who probably cares the most about that day. I was able to share at least one of my birthdays with only one other person and it made it all the more special to me and them. So, that's pretty much it. My birthday was almost forgotten and now I'm glad for it."
