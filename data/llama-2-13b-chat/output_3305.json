        "Summarize the following story in first person: So, the story I have for you happened this past Friday, August 23,2019. The event came at us out of left field last spring when my son announced he was finally getting married to a beautiful girl he had started dating for over 4 years! We didn't really expect it, because they had been dating so long. Well, the day finally came and my son looked like a million bucks. He was dressed to the nines in his black tuxedo, with his beard neatly groomed, and a smile from ear to ear. Then we saw the bride and wow what a dress! She was beaming with joy and excited more than I've ever seen her before. The bride's parents had rented a really nice outdoor chapel on the side of a mountain in the North Georgia Mountains. The place was incredibly beautiful this time of year as fall is quickly approaching us. Many of my sons friends and family were there, people from his childhood, church, and schools. It is so memorable and significant for me thinking about that day. I sat there thinking back over the years at all the amazing times that we have had together, and at the same time I was watching him stating his vows and thinking about the man he has become. After the wedding ceremony they had a reception that went for about four hours. It was pretty fun and everyone got to dance and party like their was no tomorrow. I danced with my wife and my fifteen year old daughter both. It was a very special moment for myself and my wife on the dance floor because we didn't get married in a church, and had no reception. So...ultimately seeing him married and thinking back over the past when we had him at 18 and where we are now, was very special to all of us."
