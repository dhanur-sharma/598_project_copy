        "Summarize the following story in first person: A few weeks ago, my son one an award at school. This is a pretty big deal for many reasons. James had a tough year last year. For some reason the teacher labeled him as a difficult, talkative kid. James is so quiet and sweet this made no sense to me. So there was no way she was going to nominate him. However, his teacher this year recognized how sweet and kind he is. He tends to get walked all over so it is nice to see him be recognized for who he is. I am very proud that I have raised such a kind and helpful child. He was recognized for being a leader in the class. For helping his teacher and recognizing others good behavior and potential. He is always trying to help his fellow classmates. We went to the awards ceremony and my eyes filled with tears to see my shy, quiet baby getting recognized for all the good he has done. As a mother there is nothing better than seeing your child succeed. It may seem like a silly elementary school award, but I look at it and see how far he has come. I also see that in the future he will be the kind of adult I want him to be."
