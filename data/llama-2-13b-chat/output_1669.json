        "Summarize the following story in first person: Five months ago I was still mourning and healing from the abrupt death of my mother who died late last year. She was my best friend. She was married to my father for 42 years and he was heartbroken over her death. Five months ago he died from that broken heart. I was the classic daddy\u2019s girl. I was  such an emotional wreck over their deaths that I went into auto pilot. I was dealing with funeral, insurance companies and estate issues and was just going through the motions. I signed so much paperwork it all looked the same. It was just a part of the process. My parents loved me dearly and spoiled me greatly. They always took care of me, even as an adult. Exactly 3 weeks after his death I started receiving settlement checks in the mail from a lawsuit he had just finished. It turns out that my father was awarded settlements from a lawsuit at the time of his death. As the executor of his estate the funds went to me. I was floored. The 12 checks were made out to me and had my father as reference. I immediately called the law firm and was explained that I had already signed the release and they had all that they needed. In  my autopilot state I signed all of the paperwork without even realizing it. And that was just the first round of checks.  My parents found a way to take care of me even in their death."
