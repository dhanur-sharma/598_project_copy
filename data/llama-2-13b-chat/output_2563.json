        "Summarize the following story in first person: Me and my daughter prepared for a children's birthday party. It was my coworker/friend's daughter's birthday party. It was going to be fun because well, it was a childrens birthday party. We arrived at the home of my friend and we greeted each other, I also greeted her daughter a Happy birthday. My daughters and my friend's daughter went ahead and played at the playground. I went ahead and prepared the lunch for my daughters, good thing they have hotdogs with the marshmallow on top, it's a timeless classic to serve in a kids birthday party. I got bored talking to the other guests there that my friend invited that I knew. My friend and I are very close so I know a lot of her relatives. When I got bored I tried to create an event that the parents of the kids will be able to participate. It was getting boring that the kids only get to play and the adults were all bored talking to one another since everyone could not focus on the topic because the kids always needed our attention. My friend definitely approved my plan on creating games for the adults or parents to play, games that are more for kids specifically. The parents loved my plan because they felt like little kids again. Of course the kids had more fun because they get to play too with their parents along with new kids that they just met. It was a birthday to remember because I don't usually try to get into other peoples birthday parties, but my friend and I were close and she definitely loved my idea. I told my daughters that everytime they will get a birthday party, it will be just as fun, or even more."
