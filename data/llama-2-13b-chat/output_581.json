        "Summarize the following story in first person: Around 4 to 5 months ago, I believed I was in line to receive a promotion at work. I had been working diligently, and had even completed training classes for the promotion. I had completed these classes in my spare time to show my dedication for the job. My direct supervisor had repeatedly hinted that I would be the one to get the promotion as my statistics were some of the best in the company. I was extremely excited for the opportunity and felt my hard work was about to pay off. I was even planning on upgrading some things in my personal life with the increased salary. However, on the week I was to receive the promotion, I never heard anything from the managers in charge. I waited a few days after the deadline and was getting ready to send one of them an email when I heard clapping from the other side of the office. To my shock, one of my coworkers had received the promotion instead of me. I felt surprised because I new my stats were much better than his. I did my best to congratulate the coworker, but left the office feeling confused and a little hurt. I was disappointed in not receiving the new job because of the status and money that it held. I tried my best over the next few weeks to work hard so I did not have time to think about anything else. I think this may have hurt some of my relationships in the office because I know I am not as social as I was before this event. I am going to try and reconnect with others and make sure I have a good shot at the next promotion. I never did speak to my manager about the situation and most likely never will."
