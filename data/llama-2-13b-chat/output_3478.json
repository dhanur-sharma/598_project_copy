        "Summarize the following story in first person: I have been hearing a lot about podcasting. Initially I did not give it much thought and considered it a waste of time. After hearing some stories about how people are actually making impact just by using podcast as a means to share their honest view of various issue and people are actually willing to listen to it. I decided to listen to one, so I had my friend recommend one for me about 2 months ago, and he did. I tuned in after getting home from work, at first I did not get the idea but once I paid attention I realized what every was saying. I became a regular listeners of that podcast. A month later I was laid off at my job, I guess due to restructuring. I had nothing to do I was just at home all day everyday sleeping and eating, and maybe go out with my friends once in a while. At one of those outings I met the voice behind my favorite podcast and he told me how he got started. I decided to give it a shot, and then I did some research for about a week. I had no reason not to, no job, just bills to pay. 2 weeks ago I went live, I only had a few listeners, with few regular downloads at first. About 5 downloads to be precise and they were all my friends I suspected. One day I was just frustrated and I started ranting about my former job. This rant attracted people, I was amazed. Though I never the name of the company Where I worked but I said some things to me day to day and people seemed to like stories. I just kept on telling them different story everyday and now I am very successful as I have over 5,000 downloads every week."
