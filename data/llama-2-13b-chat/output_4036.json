        "Summarize the following story in first person: I just got married this year, i am so happy because finally i bring my wife here in US. Years ago, i meet my wife online and we became friend until in romantic relationship. I traveled hours and miles away to see here. I knew i love her before i meet her and i was right. When the first time i saw her i know she is the one for  me and i claimed it. We been in long distance relationship for so long, we travel together in different country too every time we meet. It was not easy because we always wanted to be together but i am living far from her. I have my things to be considered too before moving to her country so we can't do it for now. Until then i proposed and bring her in my country. It's so hard but we did it, we never give up and promise to each other that giving up is not and never be an option. So when she get here, we got married and finally we can start our life together for good. I never think i would get marry again after 16 years  and will be happy again like this. I been with a bad relationship and i thought getting married again is a big mistake but she proved me wrong. I tell her everyday that i am so thankful she came into my life and i love her so much. She change my life and give me inspiration aside from my kids. I know we gonna be happy and always will because we both love each other so much."
