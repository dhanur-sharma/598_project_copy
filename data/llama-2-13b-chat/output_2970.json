        "Summarize the following story in first person: My life took a turn about three month ago. My sister who was my best friend with whom I use to share all my stories and life was no more there for me. She died with an accident. She was not there to help me in everyday work and also in my life. This was so disheartening that I lost my self-conscious. I was not speaking or doing anything. Seeing me, My Moms health also gone from bad to worse. Seeing this, I had to recover for my mom. I had to stay strong for my family. I started to engage myself in a busy schedule with a time for my mom. I empowered myself with a workout and exercise. This help me get out of that trauma. For my Mom, I came back. I was back again and this time I was strong enough to tackle any situation that life throws at me. I was strong and would stand still in any situation now. This turn in my life bring a positive change in me. Now, I am more mature and more responsible for myself and for my family."
