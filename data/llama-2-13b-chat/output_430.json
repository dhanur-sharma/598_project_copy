        "Summarize the following story in first person: My daughter's pregnancy with twins is progressing amazingly well.  After the initial shock of learning that she was carrying twins, she and her husband are now quite excited about the growing size of their little family.  One of the most memorable events in recent weeks was the gender reveal ultrasound.  Since my son-in-law's family historically only produces boys, they were not surprised when their first child, Braxton was a boy.  So going into the most recent ultrasound even the doctor assumed that they would learn that the twins were both boys as is the tradition in their family.  However, that was not to be the case this time!  They are expecting twin girls in early January of 2020.  At this time, it as not been determined if the twin girls will be identical or fraternal.  The doctor indicates that the girls can be safely delivered anytime after 35 weeks into the pregnancy.  With a projected due date of January 20th, it is possible that our family could welcome the babies yet in 2019.  This would be an added blessing of two additional tax deductions on the Federal Income Tax Filing.  Little #1 Son, who turned two years old on October 10th is in for a real surprise when his little sisters arrive.  He may be a little jealous of the attention that they will demand.  However, we believe that he will quickly learn to love them when he realizes that the babies are here to stay!  To say the least, I am one very excited grandmother!"

It will be decorated with a mermaid theme in shades of blue and green.  My husband and I have already selected several adorable outfits and accessories for the babies, and I can't wait to see them in their new clothes.  Overall, our family is thrilled about the upcoming arrival of our new little blessings, and we can't wait to meet them!"
