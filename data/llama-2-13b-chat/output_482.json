        "Summarize the following story in first person: Dear Diary, It has been awhile...I have been so busy that I have not gotten around to writing about what is going on in my life. So much good has occurred but I have to go back a little ways.  It all began 3 months ago. After several glasses of wine at a girls night, Holly made me go back online to my dating profile and check out my DMs. It was the standard garbage...as in: you are beautiful; want to hang out; how about we meet up and hook up. Ugh! There was also the standard aloof messages that just said \"Hi,\" \"Hello, how are you,\" and things of that general nature. I wasn't really in the head-space to notice one of the guys but Holly immediately noticed someone. His message was fairly normal but seemed a little more genuine, I suppose. Holly and I then checked out his profile and generally stalked as much as we could lol. Then she decided I should reply back to him...I did but almost just so she would stop making such a big deal out of it. Well, much to my surprise, he replied that night and after Holly left I chatted briefly with him as I got ready for bed. Amazingly, I didn't find any of our initial conversation cringy; we just sorta hit it off. Our messages back and forth were honest and it felt intriguing. I went to sleep that night wondering a bit about this new guy but I didn't really have my hopes up - the guard was definitely still up. Anyway, over the next few days we exchanged messages and at some point, I gave him my cell number and we started texting! About 1.5 days into this, he called me and asked me out to dinner --- and soon --- it was going to be the next night; I was nervous but I agreed to meet him. This is where I generally thought things would fall apart as they usually do, but that night we met at a small, quaint, Italian restaurant downtown. We ordered a glass of red and some pasta and what ensued was awesome and blew me away. We talked and talked and just generally enjoyed our food and company. My biggest test - you know the one where I tell the guy that I'm a single mom and I have lupus mostly to see their reaction - well, he didn't even flinch. And instead, he engaged with me about my experiences and was empathetic. That's when I finally realized and believed, this guy is amazing. It had only been a short time but we really hit it off; looking back it almost feels like it was meant to be. I'm so happy to say we are still talking 3 months later...more to come,yay!"
