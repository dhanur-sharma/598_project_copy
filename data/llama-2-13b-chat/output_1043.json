I needed to find someone that could enjoy the passion of my pursuits. And I found them. Within the same school. Within the same program. I knew they were the one once I saw them. They understood my passions because they had the same one career wise. We ended up being always together and knowing that the future voyage in life was going to be fun. We ended up getting married a few years after graduation. It was something small and sweet. And oddly enough, related to our careers. I felt that our mission in lift was quickly realized and we have had fun ever since. We still love each other. Along with our careers."
