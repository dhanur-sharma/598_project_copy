        "Summarize the following story in first person: Four months ago I finally had my green card interview. I'd been living in the USA for two years and my paperwork was caught up in a huge backlog. It was horrible having to wait for so long, like my life was on hold until this one person could grant me the status to stay with my husband. The interview was terrifying. We were called in to the officer's room ninety minutes late. I was carrying three big binders of \"evidence\" to convince her that our relationship was real. She read the oath, confirmed our identities, and then asked a string of questions from the form. Her face was totally emotionless. I nervously joked through certain answers while my husband glared at me, suggesting self-deprecating humor was not suitable. After thirty minutes, she stood up and thanked us for our time. No white slip of paper that I had read about online. No details about when to expect the card or what to do afterwards. Just a quick shake of the hand and then ushered out into the hallway. It wasn't until the next day that I received confirmation my green card had been approved. I could stay! That was the best feeling in the world. As horrible as it was having someone delve into our private relationship and judge if it was worthy, every anxiety fell away at that moment and was replaced with actual joy."
