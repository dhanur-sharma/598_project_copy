        "Summarize the following story in first person: My family is very blessed with three wonderful children two beautiful girls and a boy. My oldest daughter Jennifer is a very troublesome girl, i guess its maybe the adolescent age creeping in that makes her act a little out of control sometimes but in a nutshell she is an adorable angel. My second child is Jason my sweet little boy, he likes to think he has grown but i still call him baby just to piss him off  sometimes. especially in front of his friends. my little mermaid is Anabel she is adorable as any child you would ever see. she has this aura that is just welcoming and so amazing. she is beautiful, smart and charming. On her birthday I and my husband decided to make it  memorable one for her and the kids by buying a sugar glider to surprise on her birthday. she had always a pet the kids had all been yearning for a pet. so six months ago we started preparing for her big day, we bought cakes, drinks and lots of stuff so the children that came to celebrate with Anabel would have fun. On the day of her birthday it turned out she had a flu due to the cold that season, so she was not really in a great mode. the other children were expecting to see a vibrant and playful Anabel, but she was dull and moody. so we decided to make her feel better by showing her the surprise we had for her. when she saw the sugar glider she was so excited that it felt like she was not even sick in the first place. Everyone invited to my youngest daughter's birthday party had a great time, even though it was cold. They got to play with a sugar glider and see it jump on my oldest daughter's head. My youngest daughter (the birthday girl) surprised everyone by take a few steps in-front of them. She showed them how to pat the sugar glider properly. It was an amazing party."
