        "Summarize the following story in first person: About one month ago, I received an unexpected text message from my friend. He and I had not spoken in almost two years because we had a falling out towards the end of 2017. This was a friend I made in graduate school, and with whom I used to hang out fairly regularly for about four years. We would go to the movies, go hiking, have lunch, and other things. I helped him through a particularly rough patch when he lost two people close to him and went though a breakup within a year's span. I was glad to have him as a friend and we could talk about important matters with one another. At one point, however, our friendship became very strained, and we had an argument, after which we didn't speak for almost two years. When I received that text (which was simply a \"Hi, how are you?\"), I was very unsure about whether to respond to it or not. I put it off for a few hours, but finally decided to answer back. I did not receive a response for several days, and was not sure what happened: whether he was experiencing a major issue or just wanted to be friends again. When he finally texted me back several days later, it turned out he was reaching out to invite me to his wedding. He was getting married the next month, and wanted to reconnect and make amends. I was taken aback because I had not expected to ever hear from him again. I was cautious about going, but decided to accept his invitation after consulting with a few people about whether it would be a good idea. The wedding was in just a few weeks, so it was short notice, and this would be the first time we were seeing each other in almost two years. I was afraid it would be awkward or tense. Luckily, the wedding was a beautiful occasion, and I was glad I went and was able to reconnect with him after all this time. His wife is a very intelligent and lovely woman, and I am happy for him, especially after the difficult time he went through."
