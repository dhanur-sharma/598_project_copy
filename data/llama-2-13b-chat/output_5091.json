        "Summarize the following story in first person: A friend sent me an email that one of my closest friends had died. I was astonished. No one knew anything was wrong with her, not even her. But she had a sudden aneurysm and there was nothing they could do by the time she was at the hospital. I got in touch with other old friends in her social circle to get more info. We were able to see what an impact she made on the lives of so many people. I had known her for about 15 years. I transferred to a different school and didn't know anyone. She was the first friend I made there. We were seated near each other and somehow became friends quickly.  She had a good sense of humor. She was also very smart. It's just a real tragedy. The death was completely undeserved and unpreventable. We just have to remember her going forward."
