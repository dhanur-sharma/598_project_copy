        "Summarize the following story in first person: 3 months ago I went to my cousin's wedding--we were really close as kids, and she was marrying one of our childhood friends. I felt a bit empty, having just gone through a divorce. Seeing them together made me depressed, because I remembered our childhoods and how we used to be so close, and how we slowly drifted apart over time. life just takes you in different directions, I guess? It's funny, I actually dated her fiance in highschool. It wasn't too serious, but I never thought they'd end up getting together. They just didn't seem to have that type of chemistry--they were just friends. But I guess they were best friends, in a sense? And I guess that's the type of person you'd marry. I don't know. I just, I feel happy for them. I just feel so sad about my personal life and all that. Like what if I had married him? What if I had chosen a guy who wasn't just, terrible? It just filled my head with horrible thoughts. I tried to be happy for her, I really did, but I just couldn't get over my own personal baggage, I guess."
