        "Summarize the following story in first person: I've never been the person to give speeches. However, when I went to my best friend's wedding, everyone certainly expected one out of me. I was so extremely nervous as I spouted what I viewed as nonsense up there. Surprisingly, nobody hassled me. Nobody gave me a hard time. In fact, the reaction to my speech was so overwhelmingly positive, that I just couldn't wait to say more. I'll never forget that speech. My best friend was so happy, and he even looked like he might start to cry. He didn't cry, but I'll never let him live down that he almost did. I love that guy, and I love his new wife as one would a sister. I made sure to mention that in the speech that I gave. It turns out that people are just as insecure as you are when you give a speech. Everyone is so worried about themselves and their own fears that they just don't care about you, for lack of a better way to say it. I certainly am glad that's the case. Now, I'm not as afraid to give a speech anymore."
