        "Summarize the following story in first person: My son moved into his first apartment. His friends share a house and there was a room spare so he decided to move in. It was quite sad to help him pack, thinking that he wouldn't be living at home anymore.   That said, I was excited for him to start a new adventure in life. The most surprising part was helping him to go through his belongings to decide what to take with him. We found old books and toys from his childhood. We also found old homework assignments dating from 1st grade to 12th grade. It was a lot of fun reading them. Packing his belongings and furniture into a van took most of the day. My son was very excited but he also seemed a bit nervous. It was difficult to hug him goodbye but he promised to come back and visit very soon. He actually came back the next day! It turned out that he had forgotten quite a few things that he would need at the new house. He also found out that the washing machine didn't work so he would be coming home quite often! That made me happy even though it meant I would be doing his laundry again!"
