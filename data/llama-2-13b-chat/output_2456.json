        "Summarize the following story in first person: We just recently had our biannual family reunion and I was asked to be in charge of food and drinks. As soon as I found out this information and the location of the event and cooking options I began researching for recipes and methods of preparing food for large groups of people. I wanted the food to be delicious and to be able to keep making it fresh throughout the day and for the drinks to be tasty while giving everyone choices. For the drinks I purchased many watermelons , berries and other melons and created a fruit mix ice and water. We used the carbonation machine at the building to add fizz to the bottles as they had some large seal-able bottles we used to make fruit soda essentially. For the food I began by making sandwich patties with lentils and oats and spices to go along with the grilled vegetables. Dad helped set us the grills and we had a nice even heat going by mid morning and began cutting up the various vegetables and potatoes and yams and onions. We had a large variety of foods all prepared by mid morning and began setting them on the grill in trays and allowed them to cook. The first people starting arriving before noon to help and I wanted to have the first batch of food ready to feed them and also to test the system for when the bulk of the family arrived. The first batch of food, thanks to dad helping watch over and regulating the heat, was perfectly cooked. I asked my aunts and uncles to take a break from setting up the tables and chairs and so we all took a break and tried out all the grilled veggies and potatoes and they each had a bit of the sandwiches too. I then poured them all a fizzy fruit drink and they all said it was delicious. We went to the store and purchased several more watermelons and stopped by the farmers market to see what they had and was able to buy freshly picked strawberries. We also bought a box of potatoes and brought all the food back to the party. A few more relatives arrived while we were out getting food and they volunteered to help prepare the potatoes for the grill. We had many different trays and so decided to spice each tray of potatoes differently with some adding peppers and onions . I also created two trays of brussel sprouts and added several other vegetables. The food was a bit and later we popped a bunch of popcorn and each family also brought a dish and so we had all types of foods and deserts."
