        "Summarize the following story in first person: My uncle Harold died 3 weeks ago. It came as a shock to all of us. He was a very healthy man. That was what was most surprising. I mean, how could a fifty-year-old man in perfect health just not wake up one morning? Of course, his wife (my sister) took it the hardest. I've never seen that level of frustration and anger and sadness on someone's face before. And the fact that that was happening to my sister was almost as hard to take as the death itself. My parents took care of all the funeral arrangements and things like that. Harold didn't have any immediate family close by. In fact, only five people showed up to the funeral who were related to him. That was really awkward. About 30 or so people showed up from our side of the family, and our friends. Harold was sort of a loner and didn't really have many friends, just mainly acquaintances. So I guess that makes sense. Still, I would have thought that some of his coworkers could make it. I'm not sure if my sister will ever really get over this. Time will tell."
