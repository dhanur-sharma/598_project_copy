        "Summarize the following story in first person: Recently, I took my children to Universal Studios for our annual summer trip. We went in June, which was about a month ago. I took all five of my children and my husband went. We go during my work's night at the theme park. My work buys out the park once a year and it is all people from my work sites that attend. It is a special event and there are a lot of extras like photo booths and face painting and things like that. We enjoy getting to go on all of the rides a lot faster and have the park not be very crowded. What was really memorable is that the Walking Dead ride was closed for the majority of the night. When it opened it was very late in the evening, but we made ourselves second in line. There was a woman in a wheel chair getting wheeled in  by her family just before us and she was mad and cussing that she had to go. Part way through the whole ride shut down and the lights came on. They told us to go to the emergency exits, but what was funny is zombies were running around not knowing what to do. Some were pointing at the emergency exits still in character. It was hilarious. I guess the woman in the wheelchair freaked out and pulled the alarm."

We were there for like 2 hours waiting to go on the ride. I was so glad that I brought my portable charger and my phone had enough battery to take all the pictures and videos that I did. I had so much fun and my kids loved it. We all got to go on all the rides and it was just a great time. We left the park at like 2am and got home at like 4am. It was exhausting, but so much fun.\n\n"
