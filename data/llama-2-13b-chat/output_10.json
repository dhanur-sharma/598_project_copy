        "Summarize the following story in first person: About a month ago me and my girlfriend went to the zoo. It was an unexpected trip we just decided to go on a random Wednesday. It was a pretty hot day that day considering it was the middle of July. As soon as we got in, we saw that there were some seals to the left of the entrance so we saw them for a few minutes. Then we went to the insect section of the zoo. There were so many of them like spiders, scorpions, also bigger animals like cobras, rattlesnakes stuff like that. Then we saw the elephants. It was pretty interesting because they were in an area that looked like a jungle and off in the distance we heard gorillas grunting. So we walked around until we found the gorillas and around there we also saw other kinds of primates like chimpanzees. We walked around a bit more and we stumbled upon all the other African animals like tigers, lions, giraffes etc. It was actually pretty cool to see the giraffes because one of them got really close to me. Along the way we saw a lot of different kinds of birds and small animals. We passed by the koalas and other Australian animals like Tasmanian devils, and kangaroos. I would have enjoyed it more though if we had gone on another day. It was really hot that day and we didn't really prepare for it. But I really enjoyed going there and we'll probably go again soon."
