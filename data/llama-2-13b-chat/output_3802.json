        "Summarize the following story in first person: Well, today was the day it finally all came together. I've been working for months to get my mother state help for her dementia. I knew she had been diagnosed, but I didn't know how bad it was until then. Ever since then it's been constant calls, week-long trips down to try and get paperwork done, and worrying. So much anxiety that I've lost 30 lbs in the space of 4 months. Every week there was at least one crisis where my mother was overspending herself into the red because she couldn't remember getting money out of the bank that day, or signing up for multiple life insurance policies. When I first applied for Medicaid for her, I was instantly rejected and no one told me. I had to call up after a month before learning she made $195 too much in Social Security to qualify for assisted living. I was devastated and started crying. But I kept going, kept pushing, and found out that I could apply for home services because it had a higher income bracket. Getting the paperwork together from 250 miles away was hell and it took weeks and weeks even with help from my aunt who lived nearby. When we finally got it in, the Medicaid service worker who was helping me was taken off the case and her case was given to someone else, but they didn't tell me. It felt like a merry go round, and my head was always spinning. I spent a lot of nights crying when my mother would call and spout word salad, feeling like I was totally alone in the world. Everyone I called said they couldn't really help and some places didn't even pick up the phone. A long-distance caregiver, only child of a single mother, so young and trying to care for her mother with dementia when she should be having kids and starting a family. I didn't want to be self-pitying, but I did fall into it sometimes. Then I opened my mailbox and it happened. It was a letter saying that she was approved for Medicaid waiver HCBS and that she could start immediately. I dropped to my knees and started crying, knowing that the fight wasn't over but that at least I had some sort of help. Someone recognized that my mother was in need and that I couldn't do it alone. It's still been a struggle since then and she's definitely had some very bad days where I had to go down to make sure she was OK. But we are slowly moving towards someone being there at least 4 days a week for some amount of time, which is more than she has now. This letter has changed my life, because it proves that someone listened. I'm no longer alone and neither is my mother."
