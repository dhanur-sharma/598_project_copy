        "Summarize the following story in first person: I miss my stepfather so much today. It still feels like yesterday that he passed away. I don't like to talk about it too much because I will spend the entire day crying, but I have to let out some emotion about it because I have been holding it in for too long. I can't believe it has already been 6 months since he left us. He was the greatest man I had ever met. He really stepped in and treated me and my brother like we were his own children. He gave us everything we needed or wanted, and he was amazing to my mother. We were all shocked when he got cancer. It was very sudden. One day he was healthy and strong, and the next he was reduced to a thin frail man who could barely walk. As the disease progressed it became more and more obvious he would be leaving us soon. That reality was so hard to accept. I remember crying for days nonstop thinking about life without him. He didn't deserve this. No one deserves cancer, but he was such a good person he really didn't deserve anything like this. The day he died was like any other day. We were sitting around his bed talking and joking. Something was playing on the television in the background. I remember looking at him and thinking he looked peaceful. I looked back again and his eyes were closed. And that was it. After that he was gone. My mother tried to wake him. Then we all tried to wake him. But he never woke up. The cancer had won, he was gone"
