        "Summarize the following story in first person: Dear Diary,I would say this happened about 3 months ago. It was during the summer, and all of our bags were packed. My friends and I were ready to go to our trip to Acadia National Park.  We were extremely excited for this because we planned this all year long, and it was finally time to embark on our journey together. It was about a 5 hour drive, and it took a long time, but during this drive, it was extremely eventful. In fact, what happened that day could have been one of the scariest things that happened to us. While listening to some music, my friend was driving the car and singing along, and stopped paying full attention to the road. Suddenly, I could feel him drifting left to right and not have full control of the car. This scared me instantly, and I shut down the music being in the passenger seat, and told him to focus on the road. But there was a cop behind us looking at what we were doing, and he pulled us to the side just to ask to make sure if we were drunk or not. Just experiencing that part really scared us because we knew we all weren't drunk, but the feeling of being pulled aside is a scary moment. We continued with our journey, and the entire trip was great. However, just that moment was the one thing that resided within our minds throughout the entire trip. Going through this experience, I learned to always keep our eyes on the road. I know it is a cliche story, but it is what actually happened, and it affected me in a very big way."
