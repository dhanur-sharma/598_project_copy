        "Summarize the following story in first person: Four months ago I was at a surprise birthday party for my grandparents 50th wedding anniversary, It was a wonderful time with many momentos from their past shown or recounted by others. My grandparents were completely taken by surprise and were very touched by this event. It was a wonderful time for me too. I learned things about their lives that I did not know, some of them significant. When I learned how they had to abandon the family farm because of the dust storms and travel to California with all their possessions with two little children and almost no money. The hardships they endured made me think about how blessed my life has been. It is also very heart warming that they ended up living on the Pacific Ocean south of Santa Cruz where they eventually bought their own property with the money they earned from picking fruit in the Santa Clara Valley.       During the party my cousin Sarah offered to come live with them to help them get treatment to combat their advancing age. What a nice thing to do. It will be a win win for all, because Sarah will be going to school just 10 miles from where my grandparents live. Life is simply wonderful to be part of such a close knit extended family. I really appreciate what Sarah will be doing. My grandparents were very receptive to the idea. This way they will be able to stay in their home. Gee, I hope when I get old and in need of help their will be someone to help me out."
