        "Summarize the following story in first person: I recently adopted a new puppy. She is such a sweet and obedient dog. She has truly enhanced the life of all who live in my household. I feel better just looking at her and playing at her. I know she will always be there to support those around her with unconditional love. I have always been more of a cat person but admittedly have never had a dog in my life really. I now understand why people love dogs so much. My sister recently lost her much beloved dog. This was after an average lifespan but with several health complications. This inspired me to adopt a puppy of my own. I am so thankful that I did. Dogs are a real game changer when it comes to enjoying life to it's fullest. I still really appreciate my cat but I have newfound perspective on dogs. Animals are such a gift to this planet. I wish people would realize this truth everywhere."
