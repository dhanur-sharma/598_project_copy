        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was bored with my job; I have been with the company for 12 years. For the amount of responsibility I have, I should be higly paid. I am not. Due to unreasonable demands and lack of compensation, I decided I wanted out. However, my skills are limited to the medical device field, I chose to go back to school and decided a MBA was appropriate. I was thinking about a MBA for years but never went through with the application process. I took many classes and received many certifications in fields such as project management, leadership, etc. I had no other choice. So, I applied and was accepted. I was very happy. I told my manager and he agreed that other people on my team need to step up and share my workload and I cannot be the only spokesperson for the company when regulatory bodies audit. I happily shared my news with my co-workers, and as expected, they were less than thrilled. Now, they would have to stop being lazy slackers and actually do some work. I implemented my new schedule immediately. There were audits approaching and I pulled back. It forced others to learn the role."
