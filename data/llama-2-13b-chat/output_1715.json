        "Summarize the following story in first person: Dear diary,Around four months ago, I went on a date with a woman other than my wife for the first time in my life. My wife and I had decided to open up our relationship a little bit and experiment. So I downloaded Tinder, set up my profile, and began looking for a potential match. In the end, a woman who I'll call \"Claire\" matched with me and we began chatting. For around a month, we would text over the phone, trying to learn as much as possible about each other before we met up. Eventually, we decided to have our first date. I suggested a Thai place I really like and she agreed. It was a little awkward when we first saw each other but we quickly warmed to each other; I'd venture far enough to say that we hit it off. The first date lasted for hours, as we went for some frozen yogurt after dinner. She liked me enough to suggest that we go on another date. Date number two was at a place she suggested: a pub which featured board games to rent. She decided on Trivial Pursuit and we played a game. I feel like my behavior during the game might have turned her off, as she later said she thought we should be friends. However, that turned out to be a blessing in disguise as my wife and I decided dating other people wasn't for us and I got a good friend out of the deal. \"Claire\" and I have subsequently hung out many times and we continue to text almost daily."
