        "Summarize the following story in first person: All my life i knew that i was gay. A few months ago i was having a deep talk with my father. My father would be known to be a very tough  person, very strict quite religious i would say, and for that i was afraid of him. As father and son we are not that close,i was more closed to my mother . Being 28 years old no girlfriend yet and i'm quite feminine.      Having these conversation i would say i am quite nervous because the topic might go towards my sexuality and it does. My father asked me ,do you have a girlfriend? I said no i don't have, son are you gay, i was very nervous and tense i don't know what to say. I just said if I said no are you going to believe or if I said yes are you going to accept me?  My father said ever since you are a child i knew it , i just don't have the courage to asked. and i accept you regardless because you are my son and i love you. I was teary eyed and overwhelmed with happiness because i am finally free of myself of always being afraid to be found out by others.    When i'm thinking about this event in my life i am always filled with happiness and love. I love my father and my family, I don't know what to do without them, life will be meaningless. My coming out is very important for me that i will never forget. This conclude my story have a nice day."
