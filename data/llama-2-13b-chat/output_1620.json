        "Summarize the following story in first person: Two weeks ago my partner and I joined her family for an overnight trip to an amusement park for her nephews birthday. The park was about a four hour drive from the city so we had to awake quite early in order to make it there at a reasonable hour. I made the unfortunate mistake of drinking far too much tequila the night before so the trip was not very comfortable for me. On top of that, I had the pleasure of being introduced to a whole group of new people that I had never met before. They were all very nice, but I was not in the mood to make introductions and may not have made the most flattering first impression. We finally made it to the park but instead of being able to relax and unwind we went right into long lines for thrill rides and roller coasters. Frankly, I thought that I was going to lose consciousness on multiple occasions. My head was killing me and I was having to depend upon my partner in order to remain upright. We ate an extraordinarily heavy lunch and I began to feel a little bit better. Many photos were taken that included my pallid visage and I managed to make it until we finally left for the hotel that we would be staying in that evening. Unfortunately, this was not the end of the evening. Our party still needed to go out and buy a cake and eat dinner for her nephew's birthday. When we arrived at the bakery it had already closed, but after some pleading with the remaining staff we were able to go inside and purchase a cake. We then found a nearby restaurant and the celebration was actually quite pleasant. That night I slept as though dead even though we were sharing our hotel room with my partner's mother."
