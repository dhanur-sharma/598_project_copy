        "Summarize the following story in first person: I like the idea of fighting for myself. I had always grown up in the fighting world. I just think there was something primal and satisfying about it. I recently have been trying my hand at boxing. I felt comfortable enough with the training I had received that I could succeed. I worked my butt off, not just because I wanted to win, but it was fun. Now, I don't want anyone to get seriously hurt or concussed or any of that. But about a month ago I had my first boxing match. It was against another amateur. This was in Wisconsin. The fight barely started before he would up on the floor from a perfectly placed uppercut. He went down like a sack of potatoes. When the ten count ended I raised my arms in the air like I was Rocky and felt like the training I was in was paying off. It was an incredible moment. I can't wait to do it again."
