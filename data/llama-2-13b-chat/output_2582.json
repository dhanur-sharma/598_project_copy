        "Summarize the following story in first person: Two months ago my good friend Angela talked me into going on a camping trip with her and her boyfriend and a lot of their friends. I thought it was kind of strange as she and her boyfriend Jesus are not exactly outdoor people. I haven't been able to do much with them so I thought it'd be worth going on the camping trip. I got all packed up and ready to go on the camping trip with them and their friends, make 12 of us altogether. We met up at the camping park they picked out. Some of their other friends were already there, getting their tents ready. I found Angela and Jesus and saw they already had their tent up. I decided to put my tent near their tent. We helped other people as they arrived put up their tents. We didn't really do much that day as it started to get dark as the last tent was put up. We all worked together to get a fire going. Some people gathered sticks and small brush. Others got larger pieces of wood. I helped get a spot ready for the pit. I helped gather large rocks. We ended up making a large pit, as there were twelve of us altogether there, and we all wanted to be able to sit around the fire. We didn't make the fire that big that night as it was just more for enjoying the camping atmosphere, but the pit we made could easily be used for a bon fire. The next day we took a raft and went on the river. The raft was huge, and easily floated all of us down the river. It was fun, until the sky started to get dark. We got off the river and started heading back to the camp site. Sure enough a rain storm had moved in as we were on the river, and it started raining like crazy as we were walking back to the camp site. We all got soaked, but luckily by the time we got back to the camp site the rain stopped. We got a really big fire going that evening and had a lot of fun bonding over the fire and telling ghost stories. It was fun, even with the rain, and I wouldn't mind going on a camping trip with them again sometime."
