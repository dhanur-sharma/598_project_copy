I talked to mom and she said she has been doing well. I talked to father and he told me he caught the biggest fish that week. I talked to my sister and she has gotten a job in a big advertising firm. I talked to my brother and he just graduated college with a job prospect. My older brother is getting married to a rich tycoon woman. He will be very happy with the mansion he is moving into. I hope he doesn't get too greedy. I hope his life will have meaning. At the party, I got a little too drunk. I threw up on my older brother. He got a little mad. He forgave me. We went home with many memories."
