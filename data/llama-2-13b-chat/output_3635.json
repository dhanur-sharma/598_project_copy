        "Summarize the following story in first person: I recently visited Kentucky. It had been 20 years since I had been to Kentucky. I used to go every weekend when I was younger. It was an emotional experience as it brought back so many memories from my youth. My dad would take us to Kentucky because that is where he was from. We would have so much fun in the car and during our visits. Since my dad passed away 15 years ago, it made the experience the best one yet. So many happy memories were being brought back and I could truly look back and remember how great things were and what a wonderful father I was lucky to have. As a child, my sister and I would complain about having to go to Kentucky most weekends. We sometimes just wanted to be with our friends. Now, as an adult, I am thankful for being able to go and have such wonderful memories to look back on. The trip made me feel close to my dad. It made me feel love and happiness that I thought was gone. I was able to share memories with my family while remembering those I made with my other. It was a truly wonderful experience and one I will cherish."
