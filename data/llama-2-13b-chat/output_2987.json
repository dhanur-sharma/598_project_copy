        "Summarize the following story in first person: A bunch of friends and I went on an impromptu trip just for fun to mexico. We were in the mood to party (and celebrate a friends belated bday)and figured that since none of  us had been down to Tjiuana in so long, that we should go and see what it was like now. I grew up going to Mexico a lot and have family there, but I hadn't been in a while myself. We took a car to the border and from there, walked across. We ended up drinking quite a bit and just running through all of the different clubs and such. We did stop to see some of my family and say hello, as they own shops right on the main street in the large downtown area.. We ended up eating a lot of great food. We also ended up drinking way too much. This isn't always a good thing to do in a foreign country. We asked a cab driver to take us somewhere fun.  He took us to this random club down at the end of the international blvd. area. When we walked in a bunch of very shady people looked at us. They didnt seem happy at all. My friends and I ordered drinks when a bunch of girls approached us. They were way too good looking to be there and we all wondered what was up. It turns out the place functions as a part brothel. We didn't wish to partake so the guys there were pretty upset. This was basically a roundabout way to rob us. They started pushing us and swearing once they realized that we were leaving without spending much. They followed us outside and started throwing punches and we did the same. After about 10 minutes the politic arrived and threw us in the car and we spent a few hours in jail before being released. We walked across the border and made it out okay, but it was scary for a bit. That aspect wasn't fun. But we should have known better,."
