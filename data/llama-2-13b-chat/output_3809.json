        "Summarize the following story in first person: I always thought that working as a banker would give me the greatest sense of financial security no other career would. I mean who would not need a bank these days right? It was only 4 months ago that I realized how wrong I was. September 9th 2019. The day was like any other day. No one could have foresee the huge mess that was about to ensue. Of course there's always the news hyping up buzzwords like fin-tech, automation, and Industrial Revolution 4.0. I guess we should have been prepared, I mean the warning signs were everywhere. Then came the fateful announcement. All staffs were asked to meet in the main conference room. None of us had any idea of what is to come. One of my colleague, Pascal, thought it was about our end of year bonus, judging by how well our economy is throughout the year. Then the CEO spoke. I could not believe my ears. I still remember the face of my colleagues the moment it was announced. The company is downsizing, and my department will shrink to half its size now. Which means, half of my colleagues will be gone soon by the end of the month. I was spared however, due to my luck of being the only banker specializing in commodities such as crude oil and precious metal. Say what you want to say. Think what you want to think. While I was relieved of not being laid off, it still doesn't heal the scars of parting with colleagues and co-workers that I long knew ever since we were first year associates. And those of us who are still left at the company, knew that it's only time until the next wave of company-wide layoffs."
