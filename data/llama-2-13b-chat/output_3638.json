        "Summarize the following story in first person: Since my mom was diagnosed with cancer two months ago, I have had to accept that my life is going to change. I will have to be totally self-sufficient. But I am doing my best to save her. I have some knowledge in health and nutrition. I believe that high iron and low iodine levels in her food contributed to her problems. The most useful thing that she has done is utilize an infrared heat lamp. I use one personally and can say that it helped my health, even though I don't have cancer. The issue is that her immune system is so overwhelmed that she can't fight the cancer properly. She needs to deal with all of the chronic infections and problems. They make her constantly tired and her appetite isn't very strong. If she passes away, it will be difficult for me because I have no family of my own. It is accelerating my realization that I need to find other people in my life that I can rely on. Unfortunately, there are not many people who are close to me. I will have to move elsewhere for sure and my financial situation will be worse. I could end up totally alone in the world. I'm at a critical crossroads."
