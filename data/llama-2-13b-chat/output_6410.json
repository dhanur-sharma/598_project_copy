        "Summarize the following story in first person: Oh God, here we are... I had been dreading such a thing and now it has happened. Ms. Fong sold the property and the new owners are looking at making as much money out of it as they can. We know the drill, don't we? They are jacking up the rents as much as they legally can. Then, when people leave because they can't afford their rent anymore, their apartments are going to be renovated and then rented for a ridiculous amount of money. It happened to us when we were on 7th Street and it's happening again! One day, three will be zero affordable apartments left in this city for regular middle class people like us. And still, the streets around here are filled with young people who seem to work from home, have coffee in fancy coffee shops at 11 AM and look like struggling artists, yet can afford prohibitively expensive dwellings. Who are those people? What kind of job do they have? Writers maybe, although I've never thought that writing could be that profitable. Or they started some kind of startup and they're swimming in money because they struck gold with their brilliant new concept. Meanwhile, almost everyone I know is struggling financially even though we've all been to nice colleges and have decent paying jobs. I guess New York is not for regular people anymore. Time to start looking for a house in Jersey or something."
