        "Summarize the following story in first person: I had a very memorable event happen to me recently. I was producing a beat for a song I was working on it. While producing it I had an idea for a song pop in my head. It was a beautiful melody, and I decided to record it and make it into a song. I finished the beat and it turned out to be my best beat I've ever made. I mixed and mastered the beat and then recorded my vocals. It turned out great and was definitely my best song I made yet. I uploaded it to my YouTube page which I had built up to a decent subscriber count. Within 24 hours, my song had amassed over ten thousand views. I was astounded. I couldn't believe my music had resonated with this many people this quickly. I felt deeply touched by the fact that my dreams were coming true before my very eyes. This experience motivated me to make even better music. It also showed me that I am more than capable of making it big as an artist. I produced, engineered, wrote and recorded the entire song myself which made it feel all the more satisfying."
