        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last month we had vacation bible school in our church, It was a week celebration and i am so grateful that i was able to experience such events, And i was given a chance to facilitate some a group of kids. It was great projects and we were able to make it successful. Every afternoon we have a lot of activity for both kids and adults it was fun, we enjoy every bit of the event of it. We all happily shared the word of God and the foods. Everybody did participate real good. We also have a lot of games and prizes all kids enjoyed it, 1 full week don't seem enough for each on of us. We had different groups for all ages from toddler up to the old ones. It was indeed a blast, it was the first of many more to come. We are looking forward to make it more enjoyable and memorable every year. We all trying to make our church active again like it used to be when we were young. I am glad that we were given a chance to make our church alive again for our kids and next generation. Hoping for more projects next year again. And happy to see that our community is inflating. My kids had so much fun that they are really excited going to church now. And  because of the events people in the community was become more closer  to each other. And we came up with the decisions having youth assembly every Wednesday of the week. God is indeed good all the time. God really works in each of us and we really did experience his presence."
