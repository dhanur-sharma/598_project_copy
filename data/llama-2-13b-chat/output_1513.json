        "Summarize the following story in first person: I recommend taking Highway 62 and entering from the south, where the road is flanked with cinnamon-barked Ponderosa pines. Stop at the Steel Visitor Center for your first taste of rustic lodge architecture\u2014look for the \u201csnow tunnel\u201d\u2014and to watch the short but instructive film on the lake\u2019s origins. en proceed to Rim Village, where you\u2019ll see license plates representing just about every state and Canadian province and hear myriad languages. Here you can catch your first glimpse of the legendary blue water and stretch your legs on the Discovery Point Trail. Easy enough for families with young children, the 1.3-mile trail parallels Rim Drive, offering several tantalizing views of the lake with virtually no elevation gain. Want more? Continue on to the fire lookout at Watchman Peak, which, at 8,013 feet, is one of the highest points in the park. After the steep climb, enjoy the payoff: an unparalleled view of Wizard Island in its bowl of blue. You\u2019re in for a treat, because you planned ahead\u2014way ahead\u2014and booked a room in the Crater Lake Lodge. Originally completed in 1915, this classic example of \u201cParkitecture\u201d was almost lost. The building was failing under the heavy snow loads each winter, and it took a huge public outcry\u2014and great expense\u2014to prevent its razing. Though much of the lodge was re-built entirely, the design remains true to and even improves upon the original vision, with larger guest rooms and updated amenities. Step into a different century and enter the splendid dining room, with its unpeeled tree trunk columns, exposed wood ceilings, large windows and muscular stonework. Or, if the weather cooperates, sit on the veranda and sip Chardonnay while contemplating the view. e experience is made even lovelier with Northwest fare such as sweet corn fritters, field green salad with Oregonzola cheese, and balsamic-glazed lamb chops. If day one was all about the views, today is about getting up close and personal with an open-air boat tour of the lake. Pack a picnic and take East Rim Drive to the Cleetwood Cove Trail, which provides the only legal shore access in the park. If you\u2019re brave, launch yourself off a short cliff once you reach the shore. Brace yourself: the water averages 55 degrees, even in August"
