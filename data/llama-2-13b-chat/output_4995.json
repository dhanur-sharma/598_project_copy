        "Summarize the following story in first person: I ride my bike all the time but this time was different. I had to cross the main bridge over the river. It was packed with many children on it. It seemed oddly packed for the time of day. I tried to get across in a fast pace, but it seemed like it took forever, so many different people. And small kids can move in any direction very fast. Once I made it over the bridge, I needed to go left at the intersection. I knew I made a bad call when I didn't signal. The other bikers were expecting me to signal, but I didn't do it. At the time it just slipped my mind but I regret it now. I am a person that can often get mad when other bikers never do it themselves. I was one that didn't. In the future I will change my ways. I feel the many kids on the bridge didn't help matters. I feel they got in the way of my normal proper thinking."
