        "Summarize the following story in first person: I got a promotion about two years ago. It changed my life because I was struggling with debt and now I suddenly didn't have to worry about it anymore. I was able to pay off bills and live comfortably. It surprised me because I wasn't expecting it when it happened. Also, it was much needed. I've only received a promotion twice before in my life, so it was a happy surprise. My family sudden was able to get by and live comfortably. I got more respect at work. I was proud of the recognition.  I felt like a new man walking into work. I was more confident in my abilities. I felt like I had more of say. When I had something to say, I felt like it had more weight. I was even able to get a new car. Overall, it was a very good feeling. I can't wait for my next promotion. I don't even know what I'll do with that extra money. Maybe I'll save it. Maybe I'll retire earlier. Who knows?"
