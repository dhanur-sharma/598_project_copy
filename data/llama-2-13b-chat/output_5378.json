        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 6 months ago I experienced the death of a child. I lost my baby girl a month before my due date. I will never forget hearing the doctor say I cannot find a heartbeat. this has been the hardest time of my life. I never imaged the level of pain I could experience, and somehow make it through. I have come a long way from where I started though. At first, I felt like I was just going to die in the middle of the night from the pain. Support groups have been a great help. I have got to relate to other bereaved parents, and I learned that I am not going crazy, my pain is normal. I look forward to helping other parents through the darkest of nights. I am also thankful that I did get to meet and hold my baby girl. The funeral stands out also. I feel like I was not really there. It all feels like a dream. I find some peace, knowing that one day, I will be with her forever."
