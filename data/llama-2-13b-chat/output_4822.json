        "Summarize the following story in first person: Three weeks ago it was such a special night for me and my family. We always celebrate the 4th of july in a big way. It's a special time of year for us since we are very patriotic and believe in the USA. We often talk about how there is no better place in the world to live. My mom also had just gotten her new dentures, we were all really excited. She had talked about getting a new pair for months but could not afford it. My uncle ended up paying for them and she was so eternally grateful. Me and the family threw her sort of a mini celebration when she got them. We bought her chocolate cake which is her favorite treat in the whole world. She walked into the surprise with glowing eyes. Me and the family felt so special at that time as we always enjoy seeing each other happy. It has really improved her quality of life when eating as well which has improved her overall health. Going forward we will always ensure she stays on top of replacements with her own money. It is great that my uncle helped out but it is really not his responsibility. In the end it was a special gift and family need to look out for each other!"
