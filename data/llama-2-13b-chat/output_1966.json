        "Summarize the following story in first person: I got a message in my wattsapp classmates group that we will all meet for a reunion. It was a great news for me and I was excited to see my friends from my school days. I booked my ticket and got a decent price deal on the ticket. i was supposed to travel 8000 miles for the reunion. I was not bothered about the hectic schedule as I was all eager to meet my friends and my ex lover. I boarded the flight and I was seated next to a Lady of Indian origin. She was going home to visit her brothers marriage. I had to cut my time in the long journey so I started talking with this Indian Lady whose name was Deepika. She was very excited when I told her about the class reunion thing. We exchanged lot of memories in that long flight and she even invited for her brother's marriage. I reached the destination and went to the venue for the class reunion. Some of my friends were already there with their families. My eyes were searching for my ex lover but I came to know that recently her family met with an accident and she lost her hubby. She came a little late and we were very happy to meet after so many years. I told her about Deepika I met in the flight and asked my ex lover to accompany me for the marriage. Deepika was very excited to see me and my exlover together. She introduced us to her cute sister Sravanthi. It was a great traditional marriage. Myself and my exlover enjoyed the whole thing and for both of us it was like a dream come true."
