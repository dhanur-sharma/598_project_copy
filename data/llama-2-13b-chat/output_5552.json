        "Summarize the following story in first person: I recently graduated from college in May 2019 after spending 6 years on and off in school. This is memorable to me because at the end of all the pain and hard work, I feel I have achieved my dream of finishing school. In all these times, there were days when I had to work long hours at my job as well work on the courses to achieve a good GPA. I finally managed to get a 3.8 and earned me a cum laude. Initially I went to a  community college to get my subject credits as my friends started to go off to costly state and private schools. While they had the luxury of getting good grants my situation didn't help. I got my associate degree and then earned a bachelors by transferring the credits into a state school. As I recollect the days when the tuition seemed too expensive, I had to take time off and earn some money to keep myself sheltered. I also recollect days when I used to eat ramen all week due to scarcity of money. Looking back and thinking ahead, this graduation day would give me a great boost to my confidence whenever I'm feeling low. Dreams do come true. While these are good to reflect, it is also important to plan ahead. For example, I have been applying to numerous jobs in the last couple of weeks so that I can make use of my degree. I did clear couple of interviews at a local office and hope to hear back from them soon. In the mean time to keep myself busy, I keep working at the same job I worked as a student in school."
