        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was by birthday around six months ago. I had the best surprise when my friend took me dinner and a group of other friends and some of my family were also there. I was already so excited just to out with my friend to my favorite restaurant but when I saw my favorite people there for me it was beyond exciting. I realized how blessed I am to have people in my life that I care about and that also care about me. I had the best birthday celebration and it really meant a lot to me. I was also so happy that my niece is good at taking photos. She sent me photos of the night and I am so happy to have them. I am going to make a nice collage for my room. My birthday was a great night and it really just marks a really good time in my life. I have a great apartment that I am very happy with and things at work have been going well. I can appreciate these things because a while ago I really had a tough time and had to rely on others. I really appreciate these people in my life. I am feeling very grateful for my many blessings. It is overwhelming to actually feel happy in the mornings . It is a pleasure to feel satisfied with my daily grind. I appreciate special events like this and now I really want to focus on paying it forward and celebrating others as soon as I get a chance to do something special."
