        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was a beautiful day outside. My daughter and I were taking care of her pet rabbits. She shyly handed me a note. I read it, and in it she disclosed that she was bisexual. I looked at her, and she had already started to cry. All I could do what hug her. All she could say was \"I didn't know how to tell you.\" and \"Please don't be mad.\" I assured her that of course I wasn't mad, and that I would always love her no matter what. I also told her how proud I was of her. I just wanted her to be healthy and happy. I did remind her about making good choices in her relationships regardless of who they are with. We just jugged and cried for a while. It did feel kind of like a punch in the gut, just because I thought I knew my daughter and I honestly didn't see it coming. Also, we are a conservative, christian family. Generally, we value and present traditional gender roles. She was scared to tell her dad, but together we brought the note in to him too. We had a good conversation and reaffirmed that we support her. I am glad that we have been able to be more open with each other since this happened."
