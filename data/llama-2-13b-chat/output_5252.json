I think that they will really have a lot in common.  They should hit it off well.  I plan to get with my friends to find out how it all went.  I hope they find lots to talk about.  They should have.  They are both in the same field.  It will be weird for them meeting though, since they are from different countries.  I wonder if they will have any trouble understanding each other.  They speak different languages.  Maybe they will find a way to make it easy to communicate. This is something they never will forget.  Who knows, they may even end up together forever.  One never knows."
