        "Summarize the following story in first person: Two weeks ago I received a call from my husband telling me that he had lost his job. My stomach immediately dropped. I didn't hear what he said directly afterwards because worry consumed me and I started thinking of all of the things that would be effected. Once I could focus again I asked him if he was serious. He explained that he did lose his job with the company he has worked for for the last 19 years, but that he was being hired by the company they were changing their name to. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry, be happy or mad. He also told me that with the name change, he was going to receive a 15% raise. My mind again filled with different scenarios, but much more pleasant ones. I had been worried about budgeting for braces and this was an answer to my prayers. This would cover our daughter's braces and then some. The amount of stress that would be lifted would make a difference in everyday life. It will change our life, not dramatically, but significantly. What started as a horrible call ended up being a great call that allowed me to relax like I haven't in a long time. I know that everything is going to work out and be okay. I'm still a little irritated at my husband for doing that to me, but all in good fun, I guess."
