        "Summarize the following story in first person: For ten years I remember taking care of my mother before it became too much. I loved my mother very much, she was a very endearing human being and was outstandingly selfless. I remember it was a difficult adjustment when I first started taking care of her, there was a lot of arguing over who was taking care of who. Over time the arguing became less and less as she slowly started to realize she needed more and more help around the house, I think it hurt her pride to ask for my help around the house. A year before the idea of assisted living even crossed my mind we had a pretty serious incident that led to her hospitalization. My mother had seemingly walked out of the house in the middle of a snowy winter day and didn't remember doing so; she didn't even dress properly for the outside. She proceeded to wander aimlessly around the neighborhood until a bus driver took her aboard and back to the police station. Fast-forward from that event and the decline became too much to bare. I had to have her under constant surveillance as she'd slip without notice or find a way to accidentally harm herself while doing something that should have been mundane. I had managed to work up the nerve to get her into assisted living. The nerve wasn't mine alone as the doctor's also seemed to agree that it was time she entered this stage of her life and it was the safest way to do so. I agree with them and to an extent I think my mother would have too if she was still in full cognitive function. Sadly, I can only gesture and assure with kind words to her that I'm not forgetting about her or leaving her behind every time I visit. Three months have since passed and I've adjusted. I think my mother has adjusted as well but I'm still harboring guilt. So long as she's taken well care of I shouldn't have any issues, but I still wish I could take care of her in her own home that she raised us in."
