        "Summarize the following story in first person: I met a guy through an internet dating app.  He seemed out of my league and just like we would not have anything in common and have different life goals and interests because he was a very sharp dresser and clean cut.  As a photographer and musician, I tend to dress more in a punky aesthetic.  I figured he would be into sports and Alma Matters and I would be into plants and dive bars and we would sit awkwardly.  But he was very attractive and he was nice when he messaged me so I gave him a chance.  It turns out we have more in common then I would have ever thought and we get along super well.  Honestly, if this guy wants to marry me I would in a heartbeat.  I am still seeing him and he is the most mature adult person I have ever been with.  His clothes were not indicative of his personality.  I learned that stepping out of my preconceived notions and comfort zone I was able to meet a much better partner.  He is stable and a good communicator.  He also happened to be a musician and owns a ginseng farm on the side of doing executive financial work as a day job.  The job explained his aesthetic and I got plants and music and dive bars in his interests too.  I am very lucky that he is quite taken with me as well.  He inspires me to be a better person.  I realized I just gushed about him for this whole writing, but I think the original point of this was to say that I learned a lot about how I was limiting myself and being judgmental and was very wrong.  I grew from this experience."
