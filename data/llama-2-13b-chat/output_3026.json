        "Summarize the following story in first person: At the end of April this year, I bought my first house. It took over a year of searching to find this house. I had found several others previously that I liked, but my offer was turned down or I changed my mind after beginning the process, during the inspection period. It took a lot of patience and effort, but I finally closed on my house on my birthday. I was surprised that I had finally managed to close on a house after so many failed attempts. I was so stressed out but so excited. It was definitely the biggest decision I had ever made in my life. Luckily I had the help and support of my coworker, who acted as my realtor. I also had a lot of help from a local mortgage broker, who assisted me in numerous ways. My realtor and mortgage broker both gave me gifts at closing, which I thought was very kind of them. It has been tough to manage everything since buying the house. I do not regret the decision. I am so proud that I was able to accomplish this goal in my life. Nevertheless it has been stressful going into so much debt. I did not have a lot of experience with debt or paying large bills, so it caused me a lot of anxiety, especially in the beginning."
