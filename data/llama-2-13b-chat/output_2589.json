        "Summarize the following story in first person: Defcon is always a really fun event to attend for a hacker. For me, I always went as a guest. I never knew much about hacking, and even though my best friend was a self proclaimed hacker, nothing he ever tried to show me really clicked. So attending always felt a little weird, but again, he's my best friend, and it's not like some super secret event only the most elite hackers can attend. I always had fun just being there with him and supporting his cause. He was not one of those unethical hackers. I know that the two words kind of go hand in hand, but for him it was never about stealing money from people or invading anyone's privacy. For him, he wanted to take a stand against the government. I don't necessarily agree with that, but I support the guy. So anyway, we get there, and like every year there's tons of hackers, who all get together and try to share knowledge. There's game hackers, computer hackers, you name it, and it had a hacker. Some of the hackers there were the unethical kind. Hackers that just wanted to cause mayhem or steal from others. This was strictly banned from the con, but it didn't stop people from talking about it. Overall, I had a pretty fun time. I can't wait to go again next year."
