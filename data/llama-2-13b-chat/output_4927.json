        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 3 months ago I decided to retire from my long-time company.  after doing some research and meeting with a mentor I learned I was able to financially support myself without my current job. I was very scared but also very excited.  How nice would it be to get up and not ever go to work again! I know there would be some challenges along the way but I was ready for my new adventure. I started by meeting with my boss who is a very nice person.  She wasn't very shocked. She told me she was mentally preparing herself for months for this conversation.  We laughed and talked a while.  Next I told my close co-workers and before I knew it the entire company was at my desk congratulating me.  It felt so nice that everyone was happy for me. I decided to stay a few months to get others up to speed and trained. I really didn't want to leave anyone high and dry. The last day of my job was so sad but exciting.  The company threw me a little party and had a cake with congratulations on it.  They had banners and decorations. It truly made me so grateful for working at such a fantastic company. I wished everyone well and walked out on top of the world."
