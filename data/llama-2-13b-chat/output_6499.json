        "Summarize the following story in first person: About four months ago, I applied for a job that was a perfect fit for me. It was at a company that is one of the top in my field, and this position required a unique combination of educational background and professional experience, which not many would have. When I read the job description, I felt that it was written for me. Not often one could check every single requirement for a job, and I actually was able to. I prepared my cover letter immediately and updated my resume. I applied for the position. Within a week, I was called for a phone interview. It went great! I was over the moon after I hung up the phone, and I was sure I was going to be called for an on-site interview. Lo and behold, within a couple of weeks, I received an invitation for an on-site interview. The on-site interview was quite difficult. It lasted for a day, and I met with several people at the company, going from one office to the other without any breaks in between. At the end of the day, I was exhausted, but I knew that I did well. The manager then invited me to his office for a wrap-up, and during this conversation he told me about the great benefits in the company and how well they pay compared to others in the field. At this point I felt like they were going to offer me the job, as the way he talked to me felt like they were trying to persuade me the job before even a formal offer was extended. I left the city and came back home, wondering when the offer would come. I received an email within two weeks. It started with \"I'm very sorry to inform you that...\" Oh well... I know another perfect job is waiting for me out there, but I was devastated."
