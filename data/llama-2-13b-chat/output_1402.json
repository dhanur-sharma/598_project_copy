        "Summarize the following story in first person: In the last 3-6 months I had some of my photography work published in a magazine for the first time. I was very excited. When I first found out that one of my photos was going to be published, I was so excited and overjoyed that I cried happy tears and could not thank God, enough! This was a huge milestone for me as a professional photographer. I called my husband and told him the great news! He was thrilled for me and gave me huge congratulations!  I also called or text other family members to tell them the good news as well. They were also very excited! The photo that was published was a portrait of my son. This made the event even more special. When I got the magazine in the mail I was so happy! I showed the magazine to my son and showed him his portrait and he was very excited as well. The magazine was beautifully printed and I could not believe how gorgeous the portrait looked in it. Everyone in the family was ecstatic! This was a very joyous memory for me in my photography career and definitely a great memory."
