        "Summarize the following story in first person: I've been dating my boyfriend, Bob for a little over a year now.  I really like him, but sometimes I can be slow to commit to things.  We have a lot in common and enjoy spending a lot of time together.  It shouldn't have surprised me when he asked me to move in with him.  It was a few months ago that he asked me.  I have to admit I didn't say yes right away.  I had been spending a lot of nights over at his apartment already, so it made sense from that level.  But I just was afraid to give up my own space. I've been living on my own since college and it was tough to commit to living with someone.  I feel kind of bad because Bob actually had to work to convince me.  He said it was the right time to make that kind of committment.  And he also said that if we didn't jump in and try it we'd never know if it would work out or not.  He had a point.  I think that sometimes my fear of the unknown meant that I never took any risks.  So after giving it a lot of thought I decided he was right.  I need to just take this risk and give it a try.  So I told him I would move in when my lease ended on my current apartment.  I'm pretty nervous and excited about taking this next step."
