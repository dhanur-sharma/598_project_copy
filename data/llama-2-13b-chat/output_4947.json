        "Summarize the following story in first person: Things have continued to be going well. But I feel as if we could let it get away. Our truck has been having some minor issues that I feel if we don't get on top of they could come back and cause major problems us. We have been able to pay bills on time but I also feel that we spend thoughtlessly last month. I will have to really pay careful attention to our finances these next couple of months. Especially with property taxes being due. My husband has been thriving with his employer. He has come so far in the year he has been there. But it drains him and puts a lot of stress on him. So I have tried to increase my online work to help take some of the burden off him. We also lost out on some rental income that we had been getting so I am trying to compensate for that as well. So while we are doing better then this time last year, we still must pay careful attention to our financial state. I feel if we can keep it up then we are on track to be well off. Our house is paid off and we only owe $6000 on our truck. I really do hope that we can stay out of the slump that we always manage to get ourselves in to."
