        "Summarize the following story in first person: A couple of weeks ago my sister in law, who was pregnant at the time, was over at my house visiting because my brother was working and I hadn't seen her in weeks. While there her she started to go into labor. I was so nervous and didn't know what to do at the time people I had never been present when my sister or her had went into labor. So I drove her to the hospital and on the way was trying to get in contact with my brother. I was with her for about 30 minutes before he showed up at the hospital. I already have several nieces and nephews but this was the first time I had actually had to drive one of them to the hospital, I always used to come after the baby was born. I waited around for a couple of hours waiting for the birth of my new nephew. He was finally born and I was so happy to see him, healthy and see that my sister in law was fine as well. A lot of our family came to the hospital to visit the baby and the parents. It was nice to see some of the family because I hadn't seen some of them in months. I spent some time there talking with family members and sharing stories about what had happened lately in my life. It was just a good experience overall and I was so happy that I was there at the time and was able to drive her to the hospital. I left hours later and was so tired because I had been there for over six hours. When I got home I took a shower and ate something. I then got into bed and went to sleep because I had work the next day."
