        "Summarize the following story in first person: While I have mostly come to terms with my living with my mother, it is still weird at times. My brother recenly came to visit and it was an odd dynamic for him to visit and stay with our mother while I am a permanent resident of her place. It felt a little ackward. He is coming from out of state where he is happily living his life and visiting me, who felt like he needed to move in with our mother for her sake. He never said anything derogatory or tried to make me feel bad for living with her, but I felt it anyway. I know it was all in my head, but I just kind of felt like the loser that is living with mom. He stayed for a long weekend. We would hang our around the house and go out to eat a lot. We would watch movies at home and play Scrabble. He fixed a few things around the house, because he is good at that sort of thing. The visit was fun and it was good to see him, it just reminded me of the status of my life and how I am sort of tied down to my mother. It is all my choosing and I think my brother is glad I am here, but I still feel jealous of his freedom and that's probably where a lot of the negativity that I feel stems from. Even though I had the negative feelings while he was out here, I just pushed those to the side when he was here and acted like all was well. I love my brother and his coming out meant a lot to both my mother and myself. I know he will always be there for me when I need him, but right now I am concentrating on being there for my mother."
