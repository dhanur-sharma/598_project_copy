        "Summarize the following story in first person: In July, I took my two daughters, aged 7 and 9, to Ohio to see my boyfriend and his 6-year-old daughter. This was the first time our girls had been together in almost a year. We'd lived all together for a year prior. My girls and I moved back to Indiana where their dad lives. They are adorable together. You'd think they'd grown up together, so it was especially lovely reuniting them. We spent long day of swimming at the pool, teaching them pinball, and playing outside. Then we set camp chairs up out back at dusk to relax. The sun began to set. The youngest noticed the first fireflies. Within 15 minutes we'd punched holes in 3 mason jar lids for them to catch fireflies. Watching our little girls run around barefoot in the dark catching fireflies was a truly lovely moment. The simplicity of screen-free old-fashioned entertainment was heartwarming, especially when the littlest caught her first firefly. By the time they grew tired, they each had a jar full of flashing little bugs. While my boyfriend and I have struggled to maintain our relationship, I am so proud and grateful of how we've nurtured our girls' relationships with each other and can continue to give them lovely life experiences together."
