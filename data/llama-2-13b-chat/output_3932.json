        "Summarize the following story in first person: I'm writing to reflect on the passing of my uncle.  I can't believe its been 3 months since he died.  I am still trying to wrap my brain around all of this.  He was only 7 years older than I am.  It really is true that life passes by in the blink of an eye.  It seems like just yesterday that we were young again and were spending the nights together laughing at the lake house.  It really has been difficult losing him.  There are so many plans we had together that will never be fulfilled now.  I am going to use this as a wake up call though.  Life is so impermanent.  I am going to do all of the things that him and I had planned together in honor of his memory.  Right now, the sadness is almost unbearable.  Starting today, I am going to do my best to life life and stay in the moment as much as humanly possible.  The thing that I need to remember, is that complacency has a tendency to creep back in at the drop of a dime.  I need to revisit my commitment to focusing on the moment regularly so that I don't get sucked back into the monotony of day to day life."
