I ride my bike in the path around the river. it is time just pass 9 am. people was jogging and walking on my way. Suddenly, there is big noise from the sky. I looked up to the sky. Seven fright jets flied though the sky. People was taking picture on it. I was too late to take my picture. I wonder if it is preparing an event for Labor day. After that I kept looking at sky,  think it may be had more jets will fly though.  I could have a chance to take a picture. however, it didn't happen.  Sometime, you can't expecting a thing happen twice if you don't know what it from."
