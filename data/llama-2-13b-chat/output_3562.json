        "Summarize the following story in first person: I have always thought love at first sight is a not for me until this very day. It was 4 months ago when I rode the Metro as usual after work. I had stayed back to cover an important part of my task before going home. At 8 pm, I was just leaving the office. I was pretty famished and all in my head was what I will get to bite when I reach home. I sat down gently by the window. The seat next to me was empty and I was just praying it wouldn't be a mother with a kid that will come and sit next to me. I like kids but at that point, I didn't just want one to disturb my peaceful ride back home. I brought out my phone and starting checking Reddit for the popular posts on that day. The seat next to me was still empty. I didn't know what made me look far right, beyond an elderly man was this lady on glasses. Her nose came out a little than the other girls I know. Just when I was praying that she looks sideways so I see what she looks like, she turned sideways. I froze at the spot. It took about 10 seconds to caution myself that I've been staring way too much. Those 10 seconds were the most enchanting moment of my life. The elderly man seated next to her left and maybe not wanting to sit alone, she came to sit just beside me.  I can't say maybe it was the scent of her that made my nervous that one word could not leave my already slightly opened lips or that I didn't expect her to make that move. I just slowly turned back to checking Reddit. I still feel bad I didn't even say Hi."

I didn't want to miss my chance to see her again. I know it sounds crazy. I got to the previous stop and waited for a bit. I saw her and I didn't know what to do. I just waved at her and she waved back. We exchanged smiles and that was it. I got on the next train and she was there too. I didn't know how to act so I just kept to myself and we both just stared at each other the whole ride. I never believed in love at first sight until that day. We started talking and we've been together since then.\n\n"
