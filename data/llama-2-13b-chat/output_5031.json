        "Summarize the following story in first person: About a month ago, I packed up my bags and traveled to Houston Texas. I was traveling to meet a guy I met online who said he really wanted to meet me. So I let him take care of all of my expenses like he agreed to, then traveled for 2 days by train. When I arrived, he introduced me to his family, showed me where he worked, told me about his business. I wondered the city in my spare time every other day so that I enjoyed my trip to the fullest. I really enjoyed sight seeing and exploring and I didn't want to wait for anyone to give me permission to. I found out that my nephew and his wife live in the same city to so I visited them.  I met up with him and his wife and we talked a little and went out to see a the new John Wick movie. Things did not work out between me and the guy I met so he paid for my trip back. He became paranoid and argumentative and I learned that he was just an unpleasant person to be around and tried to make me feel guilty for his own poor behavior. At one point I secretly recorded him while he was going through one of his anger spells and I reported him to the police. He tried contacting me again but I told him I wanted nothing to do with him. I have no regrets. I had fun and I'm glad I did not give him any personal information about me. The trip was better then living with my parents with nothing to do."
