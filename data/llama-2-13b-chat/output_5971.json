        "Summarize the following story in first person: The wiring from my brain to my chest felt like dull razors cutting my insides slowly. It was very uncomfortable. It had been a major surgery. The only other surgery I had before this was a tonsillectomy when I was 15. I got to eat ice cream after that surgery! Much different experiences. I am still feeling pain and my surgery was back in May! I haven\u2019t gone back to school yet but I am hoping to soon. My family has been great but my boyfriend, Chad, has been distant. He looks at me differently now; like he pities me. I don\u2019t like it. I\u2019m pretty sure he wants to break up with me but is afraid it will look bad. I wish he would just go ahead and get it over with. I don\u2019t want to be with someone who pities me. In fact, I\u2019ll just go ahead and break up with him first! I need to beat him to the punch."
