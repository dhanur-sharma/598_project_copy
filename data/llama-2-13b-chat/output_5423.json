        "Summarize the following story in first person: It's been almost a year since my dog Bella passed away.  I still miss her terribly and think about her each and every day!  Bella was a dog that my daughter actually wanted to adopt from the shelter.  I had no interest in her and didn't really want to adopt any animal.  I was not a fan of dogs at all before Bella.  I adopted her and brought her home for my daughter.  Anyone who is reading this and loves dogs probably knows exactly what happened next.  Bella quickly stole my heart and became my best friend, basically like a child.  I loved her with all my heart and soul.  We bonded in ways that words cannot begin to describe.  A couple of years after adopting Bella, she started showing signs of having an autoimmune disorder.  She was seven years old when we adopted her but appeared to be in great health.  I will never know for sure what caused her illness.  The vet prescribed some medications that helped her but were quite strong and hard on her body.  About 4 1/2 years after we adopted her, she started to go downhill.  She was sick and weak for a few months towards the end.  To say it was devastating is an understatement.  It was absolutely horrible to watch my baby suffer and not be able to do much.  She got to where she couldn't hardly walk up stairs and had to be carried.   One night before tucking her into bed, I could tell she was in great pain because she was whimpering and couldn't stand up.  My family and I rushed her to an emergency vet where we were told there was nothing that could be done.  Before they had a chance to give her anything, she passed peacefully on her own.  I was right by her side and somehow even though it was a terrible experience, it was beautiful at the same time because she knew I was with her when she took her last breath.  I will never forget my precious Bella or the great impact that she had on my life.  I am now a \"crazy\" dog person and always will be!"
