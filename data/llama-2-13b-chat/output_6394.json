        "Summarize the following story in first person: This summer I left my home state and lived elsewhere for the first time in my life. I moved 5 hours away from my friends and family to live with a man I'd been seeing for a little over a year. He lived in a large metropolitan city and I was able to get a good job, so it was beneficial to both of us. I'm a college student (almost 22) and this internship would give me enough money to pay for the next semester of school. Unfortunately, it went very poorly. He started fighting with me, threatening to throw me out, and saying terrible things to be. I needed the money to pay for my school and I was scared to leave. However, things always got better after we fought and then he'd be very nice to me. In the past I had taken acid and gone to the museum with him, and we had a fantastic time. I wanted to rekindle that joy so I tried again, but this time didn't go well. We drove to Washington DC to see the natural history museum, and he started yelling at me outside of the museum. He grabbed me by the arm and started to pull me hard away to the car. I pulled my hand away and said I wouldn't go with him because he was treating me poorly and I couldn't handle that emotional state while I was tripping. So he said fine, and left me there. I spent the day alone, a young female, with no money to get home, tripping on acid in DC. Later he came back and threatened me, then took me home. I hated that day. I was scared and then I had to go home and sit in the apartment with him while I was tripping on acid. I just laid in bed, staring at one thing or another. He would come in and out of the bedroom to say things to me, pull the covers off me, or accuse me of feigning sleep. We're no longer together. I've moved back to school and it's hard to think about how scared I was while living there."
