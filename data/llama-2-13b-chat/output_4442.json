        "Summarize the following story in first person: I remember the first day of my daughter in school. This was a memorable day for me and felt like a lot of great achievement as a father. Kids are great and could be emotional when you know that you really made them happy. I am a graduate student studying Engineering. I have a 3 year old daughter and would turn four in 5 months. We live in a small house close to the college that I attended and I am a full time father. Most times I dress up to go to school, my daughter would run after me crying to come along. I always gave her excuse that she can't come along, because I am going to school. Meaning she got to know about going to school when she was age 2. This, together with youtube videos made her know about attending school and always wanted to attend school. I got her enrolled for head start and she was enrolled to start on August 26th, 2019. before this date, she would pick up her uniform and cry to go to school. Not long, the resumption date came and she got dressed and I dropped her off. She was so happy to be there, she was amongst the few students in her class that did not cry that their parents dropped them of. I could see the excitement in her everyday when I pick her up that she is doing what she loves. I am happy and emotional to see that she is happy with her life."
