He is able to commit to other things such as his friends and his career but when it comes to me it's crickets. Understand this, if things dont change I will have to change them. I am a young beautiful woman that deserves a man that is willing to build with me. I cannot stop my life for someone that is always doing what he wants to do. Here is going to be my way of doing things. I am going to slowly withdraw myself from the relationship. I am going to put a wedge between me and them. I am sure that he waill get the message. I cannot keep going through this. It is making me look weak. I know that I am patient because we have been together for five years. However, it should not be something that I invoke in order to get done. It should be something that he feels and believes he should do. If he feel like he needs to take a dump, he aligns himself to a toilet because he values body health. In like manner he should see value right before him."
