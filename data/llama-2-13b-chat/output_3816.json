        "Summarize the following story in first person: After the birth of my granddaughter, I was happy. Blissfully unaware, I enjoyed the prospect of having a new infant in the family to love and spoil as only a grandmother can. That happiness was short-lived, however, when CPS became involved in the baby's life because of events that had happened in her mother's history. I was shocked to find that she had things in her history that were so terrible that CPS felt the need to investigate and eventually remove the children from her care. This threw the family into chaos. Three months ago, things really changed. My son had to move in with my husband and I. My infant granddaughter also moved in. Now that she's here, I find myself raising her on my own. I love her dearly and want nothing but the best for her, but it is hard. This poor innocent child now has to suffer the consequences of her parents' actions. Why is it that the good among us always find suffering at the hands of those who choose to do badly?  I want to believe people can change, and I want to believe that someday my son and his family can care for her needs, but I am unsure. This has been one of the hardest times in my life. Although it has been so difficult, my sole focus is on this beautiful child and making sure she has the love, care, and attention that all innocent children deserve."
