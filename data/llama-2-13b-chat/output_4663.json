        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was looking forward to being able to spend time with my nephew.  My brother and I are very close and when he got married I was really happy for him because his wife is a wonderful person.  I knew they'd be great parents, like ours were, so it was with great excitement and anticipation that I accepted their offer to babysit for them while they took a much needed week-long break from work and parenting.  My brother doesn't live far away, so I drove down in my car, which I figured would be good anyway for getting around and taking my nephew for walks in the park.  When I arrived, my brother and his wife were very excited to see me!  They were nearly bubbling over with enthusiasm for my arrival.  I mean, I knew we were close, but this was unusual, even for them.  It should have tipped me off that something wasn't quite right.  My nephew was taking a nap at the time and it gave us a chance to go over all of the things I needed to know to take care of him.  There was a lot to learn!  Much more than I had anticipated.  There were the bottles, and the cleaning and the feedings and the medications and what to do if he's crying.  That was when I should have known what was up.  It turned out that my nephew had a very bad case of colic, and had been so for some months.  He was only 9 months old at the time, but man did he have a set of lungs on him.  I don't know if you've ever cared for a baby that has colic, but boy can they be loud.   My brother and his wife gathered their things, thanked me and hugged me and pretty much ran out the door.  From the moment the door closed it seemed like my nephew never stopped crying!  I tried everything to get him to stop, from feeding, to playing to rocking him.  It was pretty much non-stop crying - and now I knew why they had looked the way they did.  In the end, I discovered a great tactic for calming the crying.  It seems my nephew loved to ride in my car!  So, whenever the crying got too much, even in the middle of the night, I just loaded him in the car and drove around the block a few times.  That did the trick!  I was never so happy to see someone than I was when my brother returned from their vacation."
