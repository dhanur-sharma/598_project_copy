        "Summarize the following story in first person: The saddest day of my life is still the day my dog, Luke, passed away. I always loved my dog. He was like my best friend. He knew when I was sad and he was always right there for me to cry on. I can't even count the number of times I laid on his belly and cried my eyes out. He was there throughout a lot of my worst times as a young adult. The heart breaks, the lost jobs, Luke was always right there. Everyday when I came home he was the first thing I thought about. That feeling of opening the door and knowing he would be waiting right there and he would be so excited to see me was like nothing else in the world. I was always his favorite person. He would pretend to bite anyone who came too close to me or who touched me. He was the best thing in my world. And then one day he was gone. He was 12 years old, I knew it would happen eventually, but I wasn't ready for it. I have never felt such a profound loss. He was such a big part of my life, and now he was gone. I would come home from work and open the door and feel that momentary excitement of expecting to see him, and then I would remember he was gone. My heart would sink and I would fall apart sobbing. It hasn't gotten any easier as the months have gone by. Anytime I stop to think about him I still cry uncontrollably. I have his blanket that I sleep with sometimes. I used to use it to cover him when he was sleeping on the couch. It makes me feel safe when I am having a terrible day, the same way he used to when he was here."
