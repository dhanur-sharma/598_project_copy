        "Summarize the following story in first person: My husband and I were on vacation in Walt Disney World. It was the first day of our vacation and we had had a very eventful day. We flew to Florida. Then we hung out in the shopping district there and did a really cool VR experience there. But in the evening was when it really got special. We went to dinner at a restaurant on the top of the newest hotel. We had an amazing dinner with drinks. But the really specialty of the night was our ability to connect. I had felt like we were experiencing some distance in our relationship as of late. But it was like an aha moment at dinner where I realized that no matter what we are perfectly matched. Even if things start to drift apart, all we need is some quality time like we had gotten that day and we'll be back normal. I was able to relax with him and just be myself. By the end of the dinner my cheeks hurt so much from smiling. It was like I was so happy I couldn't even remember why it was that I felt distant from him in the first place. It was the perfect way to kick off the vacation. And it is a memory I will be able to look back on when things do get rough again as a reminder that we can always get back to that newlywed feeling."
