        "Summarize the following story in first person: I saw a car smash in to the back of another and crash the bumpers. The drivers got out and began to argue loudly. They almost came to blows and after a few minutes a police cruise, and then a second, stopped crookedly on the road with their lights flashing. Each policemen took one of the drivers to separate sides of the street and calmed them down with very loud commands. The police then allowed each driver to move their car out of the way. After the second driver did this he saw me watching and said \"what the ---p- are you looking at?\" At this point one of the policemen slapped one cuffs on the man and one to a pole by the road, for my protection. After about 15 minutes the man was uncuffed. He was not arrested. The police did issue several traffic tickets, two to one man. I could not say what the tickets were actually for. There was that moment of my being very frightened. Otherwise, this was interesting to watch. I was not involved personally in it so I could be detached. I don't think something like that had happened to me before. Once I had a small accident but there was no drama."
