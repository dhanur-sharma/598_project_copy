        "Summarize the following story in first person: And event that I can clearly think of that happened within the last couple months was when Finally got promoted as supervisor from the current project but I am working on in my field of work which is graphic arts and design. Ever since I started down this path I have found myself at a loss because somehow everyone seemed to be doing a better job than I was. Everyone else in my class seemed to  Grasp of the concepts that would be a type a lot quicker than I was so ultimately I felt like I was a failure. Although I didn't give up what I would do was spend extra hours after work to try and catch up and sharpen up my skills in the areas that I was lacking. Fortunately my boss somehow noticed how hard I was working and decided Off my ranking in the project currently working on. Don't get me wrong I know what I'm doing in the field I just learned slower pace. But this just goes to show that hard work .Really does pay off and it feels amazing to not have given up on my dream. Now I'm even more motivated to work hard towards my goals and hopefully I will make it big one day. The moral of the story is that no matter how, no matter how useless what you're doing scenes. There's always someone watching what you do and if you work hard enough toward something you will eventually achieve that goal if you don't give up. Back when I was younger I used to give up on my goals very quickly when I got frustrated. Then I would get disappointed because I would see that my progress with getting nowhere. I'm older and I have experience this for myself I can honestly say that giving up is never the answer. Whether it takes a couple weeks or couple of months never give up on what you believe on. thats the moral of this story."
