        "Summarize the following story in first person: I work for an insurance company and until four months ago I wasn't making very much money. I had a mortgage and car note to pay and it was costly. My position was that of an insurance sales agent. I loved the job but it held me back in a few ways. For one, the hours were crazy. I didn't know some days if I'd get off at 5pm or 9pm. It really depended on what happened that day. Another thing was that there was a lot of paperwork involved. I don't mind paperwork but that position required way too much. I sometimes couldn't finish it all on time. My main concern was that I wasn't making enough pay. Especially relative to how much work I was putting in. So I went ahead and applied for the position of team leader. I'd only been working there nine months and wasn't sure if I'd get the job. Most of the team leaders had been working there at least two years before they even thought about applying. There's a lot of responsibility but it involves talking on the phone, with clients, and with your team more than it involves paperwork. When I saw the position was open, I didn't hesitate to apply, even though I knew I didn't stand much of a shot. I was so surprised when two weeks later my manager told me I'd gotten the job! He said everyone had been watching me work and all agreed I went above and beyond for the team, the company, and the clients. I was so happy and overjoyed, and I felt appreciated and valued by the company. I work with a great team and every day I look forward to going to work."
