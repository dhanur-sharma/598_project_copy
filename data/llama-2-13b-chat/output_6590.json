        "Summarize the following story in first person: I work in medical tech and am pretty well known in the field. When my partner and I went to attend a conference I had no idea we were intended to give a speech. The conference had many doctors and researchers from around the world there. When they asked me to come up and speak I decided to go up and give it my best effort but I froze up. I didnt have slides or models. I was talking about a device that I could not show off or effectively communicate our product. I think i lost some clout with these people as I floundered and didnt know what to say. I know if i were being explained a medical procedure or device i would want someone well versed in it. Since this happened 6 months ago I have been working on impromptu speeches and confidence in public speaking. I want to be prepared if this happens again. I think it is important to communicate efficiently even when under prepared. I have some key talking points now and have been able to bring it up in casual conversation no problem. Time will tell if I am prepared the next time a big event comes up. But all in all I have learned a valuable lesson. Always be prepared for anything that may come your way."
