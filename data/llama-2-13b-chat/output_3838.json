        "Summarize the following story in first person: I woke up really early, probably around 5:45 or so. I don't think I was hungover, but I was definitely tired. My room was a mess, as usual, but I managed to find my graduation cap and gown and make my way to my house's dining hall for breakfast. We had really nice croissant egg and ham sandwiches, but also mimosas. These would later prove to be a mistake. After eating and having some existential dread with my roommates, we lined up outside to walk toward Harvard Yard for the Morning Exercises. We were led by a very small band, and I remember it feeling a bit strange how few of the hundred or so people there I really knew, despite having lived with them for the past three years. We made our way to the Memorial Chapel, where somehow (and certainly against fire codes), all roughly 1600 members of Harvard College's Class of 2019 were squeezed in. The minister provided a brief service, focusing largely on how important it was to remember to always think of others. This of course being a Harvard graduation, I knew that many of my classmates would go on to become business and political leaders, which are of course not a group generally thought of as being particularly ethical. After the service, we were herded back out into the Yard to begin the procession, led by my favorite organization, the Harvard University Band. It was at this point that my bladder was greatly beginning to regret the mimosas and coffee I'd had earlier in the morning. I took my seat next to my roommates, and we waited as all the pomp and circumstance commenced, beginning with the Sheriff of Middlesex County, adorned with a fine jacked and top hat, walked onto the stage and banged his silver-tipped staff three times, shouting that he did \"declare that the meeting will be in order!\". Eventually, the dean of each school would tell their students to rise and President Bacow would declare them to be graduated. Though throughout all this my mind was mostly fixed on how much I direly needed to pee, I was also thinking about how strange it felt to be leaving Harvard, a place that both felt like home and like a very strange place. After the Morning Exercises, I immediately ran over to the Band, where I danced around to our wonderful collection of fight songs, eventually conducting one myself, as is tradition for Band graduates. I don't know if I've ever felt as great a sense of belonging as I did in that moment, and looking back now, I can definitely say that I've greatly missed that feeling."
