I had never been to Spain before.  I was a little nervous.  I thought that I wouldn't fit in.  I thought that I would be the only one there who spoke English.  I couldn't believe how wrong I was.  When I got there I had a wonderful time.  The food was absolutely delicious.  The wedding was a beautiful ceremony.  There were plenty of people who spoke English.  These people showed me how amazing Spain was.  After the wedding I was shown the beautiful landmarks of the country."
