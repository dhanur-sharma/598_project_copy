        "Summarize the following story in first person: My husband has been walking well. It's a joy to see him getting back to being himself again. He no longer is using a cane, a walker, or support in the shower. I'm relieved that he was able to move past that awful chapter in his life. I know that he not walking was making him feel negatively about his day to day life, especially because he is such an independent person. He does therapy and is starting to exercise. He's been able to move on emotionally from it as well. I notice that he is generally happier, which in turn makes me happy. He continuously would say that he would never wish this whole ordeal on anyone, enemy or stranger. He has powered through this whole thing with an amazing stride. I'm proud to call him my husband, and for my son to have a father like him. We will never take our physical health for granted. We know we are lucky, because this could have been far worse. We will always look back on this experience and know that something was watching out for us. Someone was definitely on our side."
