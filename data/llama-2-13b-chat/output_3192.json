        "Summarize the following story in first person: The event I am thinking about occurred about six weeks ago from the day that I am writing this diary entry. An individual I met during working a special event contacted me in order to set up a meeting with me. This individual (\"Person A\") was dealing with a serious personal problem. I met with Person A approximately four months before this second meeting. Both meetings involved the same personal issue. Person A wanted to meet with me about this personal issue because I had some experience (and expertise) with the issue that Person A was dealing with. After some back and forth through email, we agreed to meet on a weekend day. The meeting occurred at a local coffee shop. The coffee shop was, surprisingly, empty. This was good for us because the issue being discussed was very personal so the fewer people in the shop, the less likely that someone else would hear our conversation. Person A was already at the coffee shop when I arrived. After sitting down, Person A updated me on the events since our previous meeting. Person A also had all the documents related to Person A's issue. The issue being discussed was very complicated. We discussed Person A's issue for the subsequent four and one-half hours before I had to leave the coffee shop for a family dinner. Our discussion was very involved and spirited. During our conversation I felt very close to Person A. I felt a lot of sympathy for Person A and understood Person A's desperate situation. I tried to provide as much insight into the matter as possible. I offered several personal observations. I also tried to help Person A map out a strategy for dealing with Person A's issue. When we finally concluded our conversation, Person A had enough additional input in order to move ahead with the issue."
