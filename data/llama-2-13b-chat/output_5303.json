        "Summarize the following story in first person: I feel grateful for many things in my life. One of the ones I am most thankful for is my therapy dog, and the experiences I've had with him. Sherrif and I visit the Shriner's children's hospital quite often. About 3 months ago Sherrif was a great help to a little girl named Rebecca. The bond they formed was one of best friends. I think Sherrif enjoyed her company as much as she enjoyed his. I enjoyed and learned so much from both of their companys and it helped me even more in putting a perspective on things that are important in life. Me and Sherrif were with her the day she left this earth. It was a rough day for everyone. I'm just thankful that Sherrif was able to improve her life, and give her comfort through the worst of circumstances.  Rebecca taught me more about living in the moment because we don't know how many moments we get. Even in the face of death Rebecca made the most of every second she had. She smiled, laughed, and  lived every second to the fullest. I hope I am able to be that brave if I see death coming. I hope I have the courage to live every moment as full as I can and to spread kindness to others around me."
