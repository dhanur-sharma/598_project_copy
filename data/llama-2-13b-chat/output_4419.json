        "Summarize the following story in first person: five hours might seem like a long time, but when i'm with them it goes by like it was in an instant. I remember so many great moments from that trip, like when Tom got caught peeing behind the bushes on the 12th hole! i mean we all had to go but of course Tom couldn't wait, he's always like that.         But probably the weirdest thing was something that you see in an Adam Sandler movie. I was on the 5th hole when i got a water foul, but it wasn't just any old regular foul. I'm watching in horror as my ball flies towards the lake and then CHOMP a gator comes out and swallows it! I was shocked, and asked the manager about it later just to find out thats \"Bill\".  Apparently he roams these here parts, and has done so for about the last 6 years. Unbelievable i know, but hey what can you do these things happen i guess? Man, it really doesn't feel like it was 2 months ago, it feels like yesterday and i already can't wait to get back out there and meet Bill again.        And in the end, who do you think ended up winning all that prize money for our little wager? yeah thats right, me and Ron blew it out of the water (or sand if you prefer). I mean i felt bad of course and wanted to treat the guys to something special for being good sports. After the game we went down to the local bar \"Charley's\" and had a round on me. Of course one round is never enough for us and we ended up being there until about midnight before calling a taxi and heading home. What a night to remember!"
