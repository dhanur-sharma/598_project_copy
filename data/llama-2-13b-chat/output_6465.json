        "Summarize the following story in first person: When we first started planning our vacation, we knew that we wanted some place that was relaxing, that we could take our children and just not have to travel around too.  We picked the beautiful city of Seaside, Florida.  We planned out where we would stay, the things that we would do and how many times we would eat out.  My sister and I decided that she would pay for the beach house and my husband and I would pay for the rental van and the cost of the gas and then we would split the cost of the food on days that we didn't eat out.  We planned a pretty relaxing time and most days were uneventful and we spent 5-6 hours at the beach.  There was one day that we spent in Panama City and we toured the town, shopped and ate at Pompano Joes.  There was another day that we drove back into Destin, toured the city, watched the fisherman fillet huge fish and ate at Dewey Destin.  We spent a few different evenings walking about 2-3 miles to the beach, to catch little crabs, dig for seashells and just splash around in the water, while my sister was snapping pictures.  We spent one Thursday evening having our family pictures professionally taken and those memories will never be lost!  I seen my children having a fantastic time just being kids.  My smaller little one was getting brave the last day that we were there, riding an intertube out into the ocean just a bit.  The last time that she seen the ocean was when she was about 8 months old, so this was such a blessing to be able to take her back.  I love spending time with my family and having those memories to hold onto.  We seen sea turtles, dolphins, manatees and a baby shark, while we were on the pier in Panama City.  My oldest experienced a ferris wheel and getting to gaze over the city with my niece and sister.  We seen the cities biggest candy shop and I seen my little girls eyes, as big as saucers.  I have a new found love for my husband, as I know the drive was torture and it wasn't cheap.  I seen him playing with my kids, especially my girls that made me fall inlove with him all over again.  It made me wish that we lived closer and could experience that same things on more of a regular basis.  The city of Seaside will always have a piece of my heart and I can't wait to return."
