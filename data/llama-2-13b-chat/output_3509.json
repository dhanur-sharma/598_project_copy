        "Summarize the following story in first person: I had finished work for the day and I was driving to a concert that was approximately 2 hours away.  I was very excited as I was going to see my favorite singer with one of my closest friends I do not see often. I was listening to the artists CD in my car as I was driving and thinking about how much fun we were going to have at the concert. On the way, I received a call from a friend of mine that I work with.  He told me that his mom heard my name on the radio and that I won a trip to Las Vegas. I had 10 minutes to call in and claim the trip.  I called in and to my surprise, I won a trip for two to Mexico. The trip for scheduled for the upcoming winter, what perfect timing.  I was extremely excited as I won a trip and was seeing my favorite singer all in the same day.  When I got home that evening, I told all my friends about my exciting day.  The next big decision I had to make was who I was going to bring on the trip with me. That was easy, my girlfriend. We hadn't been dating that long but I knew she was the perfect choice.  The concert was a blast as was the trip to Mexico. It was a day I'll never forget."
