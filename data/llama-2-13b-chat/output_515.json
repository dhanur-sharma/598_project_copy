        "Summarize the following story in first person: One day, I bought a projector for my daughter and I to watch movies on. It was rather difficult to set up. I'm not a very tech savvy person, so it took about two hours to even get anything to display on the screen. By that point, my back was aching so badly and I felt exhausted, but I wanted to surprise my daughter with a little gift. When I brought her to the room, she seemed confused at first, but soon saw her favorite characters from the Secret Life of Pets 2 on the screen and let out a joyful scream. It was a very enjoyable experience! I baked some popcorn on our popcorn machine, picked out my daughters favorite candy, and brought some of her favorite toys to join in to watch the movie. One of her toys, \"Jim Bob,\" a large plush giraffe, sat next to my daughter and she briefly spoke to it whenever something interesting happened in the movie. She ended up loving the movie so much she wanted to watch it again. Now, that movie is extremely long, and while it definitely wasn't my favorite movie in the world, I'm glad that she was able to enjoy it so much. I mostly just sat back and watched as my daughter's smile lit up the room. I'm sure she didn't even know how much the projector cost or how hard it was to find one, but I was happy I was able to make her so happy. Moments like these always make me excited for the future. I wonder if ten years from now she'll want to watch this movie again on the projector and reminiscence about how she talked with her giraffe and tried to make him eat some of her popcorn. I wonder where she will be in ten years, and smile as I think about how she will look all grown up."
