        "Summarize the following story in first person: having to deal with idiots is no fun.  having to deal with laziness is no fun either. but having to deal with lazy idiots is even less fun. living with these people is horrible. i have to deal with most being too lazy to even clean. one who is supposedly the \"owner\"descant clean anything and basically sits around all day playing video games and getting high when hes not at work. which btw, he barely does and then spends all his money on drugs and video games and is constantly begging us to borrow money. dealing with all that and such, we all got the nice notice from his MOTHER that they wanted to put the house up for sale. mind you, the reason they gave was utter shit. she claimed she wasnt getting money in to cover all the bills and such and it cost 710 a month for everything. so doing some light research i found the mortgage was only 200 a month, insurance was 80, water was 20, gas and electric was 220 and then that was it. so between myself and the friend there, that was 600 a lone. i have no idea what her son paid but 600/700 right off says to me they are full of shit. so myself and friend and her girlfriend all moved out. as we were moving the mother insisted we leave QUICKLY since they had \"sold the house\" to which, we discovered was a lie. im not shocked, seeing the caliber of the son that the mother was just as rude and crooked and a liar. its sad that they ruined a decent friendship over his lying and her being a ass"
