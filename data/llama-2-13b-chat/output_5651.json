        "Summarize the following story in first person: I'm going to recall my son's first birthday. We'll give him the name James. I love planning the theme and making sure everyone will have a fun time and have things to eat at the party. It's a celebration of his first birthday so I want everyone to have a great time. My husband and I were a little disappointed how not very many people said they would come. I knew my family would show up for sure so it wasn't too big of a deal. The big day comes and just a handful of my husband and I's family shows up and no friends of ours. We were crushed. We put on a happy face and didn't sulk so that the day wasn't ruined for our kids. My husband and I took it as a learning experience and put the hurt behind us. The best memory of the day other than celebrating my son's first birthday, was my grandma sliding down the huge inflatable slide with my mom, my sister and I. It was a little difficult getting to the top of the slide so we were a bit worried she wouldn't make it. We all had the biggest smiles on our faces and were laughing up a storm. My grandma has such a young spirit. It was the best ending to the day!"
