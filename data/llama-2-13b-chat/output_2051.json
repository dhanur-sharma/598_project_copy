I always knew that this day would come, but I still wasn't prepared. Three weeks ago I lost my dog. She was my best friend and constant companion. I raised her from a pup, almost like my own child. I know a lot of people scoff when you say that, but I don't care. She was family to me and I miss her so much. She always loved going outside and chasing the ball. Man, was she fast, and great at catching the ball. It was a shock to me when she was no longer able to run around. I knew something was wrong but thought maybe she just had a bug. I took her to the vet and received the worst news I could imagine. Cancer, and she wouldn't make it longer than a week. It's a strange feeling when all you can do is wait for someone to pass on."
