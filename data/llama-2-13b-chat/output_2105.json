        "Summarize the following story in first person: So after 33 years, we had our first Davis family reunion on August 10, 2019.  I'm 46 years old and I rememeber the 1986 Davis reunion as it was held at the Brewster Gun Club in Brewster, Ohio.  If I were to guess, I would say that there were at least 50 people there, possibly more.  I can't say for sure, because no photo was taken.  The other Davis family reunion was in 1973 and was held at the American Legion in Beach City, Ohio, which is about five miles south of Brewster.  I was only five months old and obviously don't remember it.  But, a group photo was taken and my cousin Shawna has me in her lap.  Well, fast forward to February 2019.  I got to thinking about the Davis family tree and thought it was about time someone put together a long-overdue reunion.  Thanks to Facebook, I was able to reach out to several relatives, and even discovered a few more that were out of state.  It would have been cool to have it at the aforementioned Brewster Gun Club, but it no longer exists.  It has been replaced by an apartment complex.  BUT, the Beach City American Legion was still in existence so I got ahold of the commander and he was more than happy to have us rent out the place.  The cost was only $150 which I thought was appropriate.  My wife and I probably spent a good 80-90 percent of the overall cost of the reunion.  A good chunk of that was renting a U-Haul truck because of all the tables, chairs and barbecue grill.  That, and the reunion was 85 miles from our house!  Needless to say, it was a lot of work getting the reunion set up and of course, taking it down and cleaning up.  We left our house at 6am and didn't get home till midnight. The reunion itself had about 35 people attend, some of which I hadn't seen since the last reunion in 1986!  There were a few that weren't in attendance that I would have loved to have seen.  Just seeing old relatives reconnecting after so many years almost brought a tear to my eye.  My one cousin wants to do a reunion every year, but I am thinking maybe every two years.  Especially if it's going to be my wife and I who put it together!"
