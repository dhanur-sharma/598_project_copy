        "Summarize the following story in first person: Dear diary I just broke up with my boyfriend for about 10 years. i was so heated when he said he was over the ida of marriage. i know it was just him being a flippin follower and not a leader and just listening to what the news or his friends are telling him. He is such a thing from a different planet sometimes. I just want him to step up. Hopefully this breakup will make him wake up that he is losing out on life. I hold the key to life in between my legs. He is the only one I am willing to suffer to bring a child into this life for. As he looks on as a spectator I am going through the fight of my life he is ready. Right now though i am sick of him. I miss him. I am sick of though. I know I am making the right decision. He has to see what life could be without me. If he want s to make it work he has to see that I am more than just some hang around girlfriend.
