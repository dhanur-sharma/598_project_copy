        "Summarize the following story in first person: Well I would have to say the most recent event that has made a huge impact on my life is TS Imelda. We didn\u2019t expect this storm to be what it was so we not prepared. The rain fell for the whole day and we slowly watched the water rising. When it got to about ankle high we went ahead & moved the vehicles to higher ground(we learned our lesson from Harvey). We went back to the house & started lifting everything ground level up. After about 4 hours water started coming in the house. We grab some bags & our dog in the husbands truck & went down the road to a friends house. The next day we went back down to see the damage that was done. It wasn\u2019t anywhere what Harvey was(we got 3 feet of water)but just enough to soak all the carpets & floors probably an inch of water. So we called our insurance companies immediately they were out the next day. That didn\u2019t turn out like I thought it would it has been a tedious process. First off they want pictures from before Harvey & after Harvey to prove the work we had done after the last store plus all the receipts. Then they want the pictures of the house now & as the work is being done this time. Then we are stuck staying with friends who we love but two families can not live together for very long without tempers flaring. It\u2019s been about a month & there finally done with the house repairs. So we\u2019re hoping to be back in our house by this week."
