        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was at work one day, when all of a sudden, I had sudden pains in my chest. I thought it was just heartburn, but then the pains kept growing and growing. I felt as if my body was going to burst. Next thing I knew, I woke up in a hospital bed. I was confused, but as I was recollecting myself, I realized that I had just experienced a heart attack. A doctor came in and told me the severity of the situation. As I listened to his explanation of what happened, I realized that I had been ignoring the problem and putting it aside for the longest time. he told me that I had some surgery done, something called a stint procedure. He then handed me the hospital bill. Despite being afraid of the costs, I decided to take a peek. It seems that most of the cost was due to a stint procedure done. My doctor then explained that it helped unclog my arteries. Weeks later, I came back into the hospital for another checkup on my situation. I could not just leave the hospital without any plans to prevent future heart attacks, so my doctor advised me to come back in for cardiac rehab. I was doing better by then."
