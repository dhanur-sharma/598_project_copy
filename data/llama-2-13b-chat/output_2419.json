        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was up for a promotion about three months ago and this entire process was draining. I did not know who else from my company was applying for it since this was a very important position within the company. I put in my application after hesitating for a couple of days and then just said fuck it. After a week's worth of waiting I finally got a call from the hiring manager within my company. We already knew each other a bit so when I walked into his office he smiled and greeted me. He asked why I thought that I was the best fit for the position and I went through the information and logic that I had rehearsed to myself. I pointed out that I already knew the business and was one of the most qualified candidates within the company. We discussed the job for another 10 minutes or so and then he said that he would call me later in the week and let me know if I got the job. After about four days I got the call that somebody else was being hired. The hiring manager explained his reasoning that he thought that I would make a good fit for this position if I had a bit more training and that the company would pay for this training and I would still get a small raise in the meantime. I was disappointed at the outcome but also proud that I took a chance and still was compensated a little. I think that my chances of getting a promotion within the company in the next year is pretty high. Even without a promotion here I know that I can get hired elsewhere. The extra training classes should help me be more employable overall. I know that my experience would be taken in at any of our competitors as well."
