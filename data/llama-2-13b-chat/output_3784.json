        "Summarize the following story in first person: A few months ago I received the shock of my life.  I was at the local Bar and Grill hanging out with some friends.  We was drinking and playing some pool, when all of a sudden my phone started ringing.  I answered the call and it was another friend on the end of the line.  He told me that I and my band had been chosen to open for musical group on an upcoming musical tour.  I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  My other buddy at the bar with me took my phone and placed it on speaker.  He held it up high so everyone at the bar could hear the news. The Bar and Grill played the message over the intercom PA system.  Everyone at the Bar cheered with delight.  But the best part was when the announcement came who we had been chosen to open for.  None other than the great band Def Leppard.  They had recently been in retirement but decided to do a reunion tour.  It  blew my mind to think that they had chosen me to be their opening act.  Me as well as the other patrons in the bar celebrated into the wee hours of the morning.  It was a great night had by everyone there."

I have met so many great people and have seen so many great places.  It has been an experience I will never forget.  I have been able to share my music with so many new fans and it has been amazing to see how they have received it.  I am so grateful for this opportunity and I can't wait to see what the future holds.\n\n"
