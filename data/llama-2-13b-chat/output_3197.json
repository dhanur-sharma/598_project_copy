        "Summarize the following story in first person: I finally got an apartment with my boyfriend of over a year. I'm very excited to move in and get everything situated and start buying all the things that I need to make it our little home. It's in a gated community so it's safer then most apartments around the area, and they allow dogs as well. I'm really happy about being able to bring my pet along, and I know he's excited for the new home as well. I'm also hopeful that we can find a really good deal on some couches, so we can spend a bit more on the t.v. we want to buy for our house. I'm just really excited to be taking this step with my boyfriend, and I hope he feels the same way. There might be some struggles along the way, as we find out what it means to own our own place, but I'm sure that we'll manage as long as we are in this together. We've already got a few things gifted to us by his parents, they've given us the basic forks, plates and some things for the bedroom as well. We'll be taking his bed with us, so we won't have to worry about sleeping on the floor when we first move in. The most surprising thing about us getting our own little place was that his aunt had bought us an entire bathroom set. I hadn't been expecting it, due to her living in Chicago, but I thought that was really sweet and kind of her to do. We both thanked her, and made sure that we'd do our best to take care of the things that came in the set. I'm just overly excited about being able to finally have my own place, since I had originally been living with my parent still, so had my boyfriend. This is a really big step for us towards adulthood and I'm just excited to get it all started. I know there are going to be challenges along the way, but I personally believe that in the end, we're going to make it work and have a place to call home!"
