        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was taking a cruise with my family and I would be leaving my cat alone in my apartment, while I was gone.  A friend of mine from work would be coming to check on the cat every few days to make sure the cat had enough food and she was comfortable.   A few weeks before the cruise, my landlord was concerned about my bathroom.  He thought there might be a leak in the bathroom, and there might be mold.  He inspected my bathroom and decided that the tiles should be replaced.   A few days before I would be leaving, the landlord brought some people over to check my bathroom.  They said the repair would take a few days, and could be done, while I was on vacation.  I my landlord that is fine, but to make sure my cat doesn't escape.  I had an enjoyable time on the vacation and when I returned to my apartment, it was in complete disarray.  My living room was a mess, and everything that was in the bathroom was spread all over the place.  I then looked for my cat, but I couldn't find her.  It was very strange, because the cat is scared and would never go outside.  I spoke with the landlord about my cat, and he said that he never saw her.  I also asked about my bathroom, and he told me it might take another week or two longer.  I happened to notice there was a hole in the bathroom, and thought there is a possibility the cat went in the hole because she wanted to explore.  I tried calling my cats name, but didn't hear anything.   Since I didn't have a working bathroom, I had to drive back to my parents house every night.  I would then drive back to my apartment to look for the cat, and then drive to work, before returning back to my apartment to look for the cat again.  One day, I told my landlord the cat could have gone in the hole, but he didn't believe me.   I was sound asleep, when I got a phone call at 3am from my landlord stating he found the cat, hiding in the ceiling.   I was able to rescue my cat and make sure she was fine.  The entire ordeal lasted almost two weeks.  Though I now lock the apartment door at all times, and make sure that I am home if anyone is going to work on my apartment.  It was very stressful because I couldn't stay in my apartment, and the landlord wasn't very helpful."
