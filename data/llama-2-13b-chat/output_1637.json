        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was recently put in charge of a team responsible for trying to land a big client for the firm. It was a great vote of confidence my superiors gave me. I decided the team formation for the task. I also decided to be on top of every decision made in this project. All the hard work paid off at the end because we got the account. The client loved our project and signed with our company right away. I was very happy and proud of myself and my team. I also got a raised and a hefty bonus, making me one of highest paid employees. This project gave me a confidence on myself like I never had before. Today I am more sure than ever abour my capabilities at work and I am sure I am on a path to become the new manager at my branch. The current manager is about to retire and I am almost a shoe-in for the position. I worked hard on my firm. I feel I deserved the vote of confidence. My manager also agreed with me. This project was a great victory. I will lead futures projects like this. I am on the top of my game."
