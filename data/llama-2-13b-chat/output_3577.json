        "Summarize the following story in first person: I am still processing the information and still undergoing tests. I had a follow-up with the urologist two weeks ago and got the results from my first tests that he did. Unfortunately, the results were actually higher than the initial blood test from my annual physical. The next step will be biopsy to be taken next week. The procedure does not look like anything that'll be even remotely pleasant but I suppose it needs to be done. I am not looking forward to it. Still haven't mentioned this to anyone outside of my wife and my boss and probably won't until I hear some definite word or whether it or isn't benign. I find myself thinking more about life and my family and friends. I am trying not to worry too much at this point as there is still no word for certain. It is uncomfortable being in limbo with such a potential issue ahead though. I hope it turns out not to be cancerous. I do not have a history of cancer in my family so I take that as a positive. There is much to do at home that I want to see finished. The grandchildren are visiting next weekend and I want to be around to see them grow up. I try to stay focused on the positive aspects of life and not dwell upon something that *might* happen yet. It just isn't always easy."
