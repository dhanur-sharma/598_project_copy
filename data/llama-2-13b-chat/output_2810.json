        "Summarize the following story in first person: A memorable event that comes to mind for me was a family reunion that I attended. I had to fly out across country to attend since I am currently living on the opposite side of the country. I was excited to attend however. I enjoy visiting with that side of my family.  We had a cook out at my cousin's house. It was a hot day but we had fans. It was by their pool and a few people went in the pool as well. We also played games such as cornhole and threw the football. My wife was there as well and we had a lot of people asking about our wedding or talking about the good time they had there. It was especially enjoyable meeting up with my cousins. We have a lot in common and always have a good time together. It was impactful seeing many of the older people in my family. Most of my aunts and uncles are getting older. We never know how long they are going to be around so it was very good to be able to spend time together. Overall we laughed and reminisced on older times. It was a lot of fun. We had a very pleasant and enjoyable time."
