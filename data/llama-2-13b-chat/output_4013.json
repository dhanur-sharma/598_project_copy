        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 6 months ago I was in labor and hurting really bad.  When we got to the hospital. I was asking for an epidural and they kept putting me off! A lot of relatives started coming but I was hurting so bad I really didn't want to see anyone. Sure did not feel like visiting. I still kept asking about pain relief but they still kept telling me it was not time. At this point I wasn't even thinking about the baby just the pain! My Doctor finally came in and checked me and said she would call for the person that would give me the epidural. The epidural was put into my lower back. It hurt like the dickens! But then the relief started. It was the best feeling in the world. I gave my permission for the family to come in and visit for awhile. They said I still have an hour or so till \"go\" time. We already have 2 boys. So we wanted a girl but at this point did not know what we were having. Soon it was time to push. She came out and was so beautiful! The pain continued! They thought it was the placenta but soon another head presented! Then a second girl was born just as beautiful as the first! Twins, how perfect. Out boys had heart conditions but these girls were perfect! We names them Annie and Lucy. It was the best day ever!"
