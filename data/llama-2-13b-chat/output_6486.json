        "Summarize the following story in first person: I wanted to say THANK YOU for your fabulous website. I found your website, and finally I have the confidence to take the plunge and take my daughter out of school and educate her at home, thank you, thank you. I cannot get over how much great information and super ideas you have here. Fantastic! This is simply fabulous!! I just now found this site and I'm so excited!! The opportunities and suggestions as well as the need to inspire are exactly what I have been searching to fulfill!! I'm so thrilled to get started and even more excited to continue to explore all of the fabulous suggestions and creative ideas you have offered here!!! When I was about 13 I had a huge crush on Aaron Carter. When he and Hilary Duff started dating I wrote in my diary, 'How am I ever going to get over him?! It hurts to know he has a girlfriend! My heart hurts. I feel like I\u2019m dying! What am I going to do? No one will ever be able to fill this void in my heart. wrote a list of people\u2019s names at the back and what they should change them to should this diary ever be published. I had written in my diary after a fight with my mom, and was very angry with her, saying things like 'I hate Mom, she\u2019s so unfair'. My sister found the diary later and showed it to her. My mom wasn\u2019t mad, she knew I was just venting my anger, but she punished my sister for invading my privacy. Best mom ever.\"When I was in sixth grade, I was in an online relationship with a guy over IM. He lived in Britain, was a year older than me, and called me pretty, so I fell head over heels for him. Some of my entries about him included 'What is it, really? Love and longing? Or a pass\u00e9.' When things took a turn for the worse (he proudly declared he made out with his neighbour in front of his mother) I wrote inspirational quotes I read in magazines, my favourite of which is, 'Pick your head up, princess, your tiara is falling. He was never faithfu'"

I wrote in my diary about how I felt and what I was going to do to make myself feel better. I would often talk to myself in the third person, writing things like, 'Come on, girl, you can do it! You are a strong, beautiful person and he is not worth your time. You deserve someone who truly loves and appreciates you.' I also wrote about how I was going to move on and find someone better. I wrote, 'I will find someone who truly loves me for who I am, someone who will be there for me no matter what. Someone who will make me feel special and appreciated every day.'\"I remember one time when I was 15, I was at a party and met a guy I really liked. I wrote about how I was nervous and unsure of myself around him, but also how I wanted to spend more time with him and get to know him better. I wrote, 'I really like him, but I\u2019m so nervous around him. I hope I don\u2019t mess things up. I want to spend more time with him and see where things"
