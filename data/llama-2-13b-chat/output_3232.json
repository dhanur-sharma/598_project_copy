        "Summarize the following story in first person: Every saturday i tend my garden. I started putting up feeders around to see some of the nature. For the first few weeks I got nothing and no activity, then about a month ago animals came. Mostly squirrels at first and a few deer, and one tiny humming bird. I was out misting the peonies and the bird kept flitting in and out of the hose. I moved the hose and the bird moved too. Eventually i got a chair and just sat spraying the mist and letting the bird flutter around. They are incredibly beautiful creatures and also very small. I worried i might get it too wet to fly but that didnt happen. I was happy the bird was there and it seemed happy to be getting misted. It was a wonderful moment of man and nature coming together. As the bird flew away I smiled and hoped he would be back again. So far i havent seen him but i will remember the simple joy i got that morning. I am glad i could provide for nature and enjoy moments like that. I hope everyone can take some time to enjoy the little things in life."
