        "Summarize the following story in first person: Two months ago I realized my family lies to me more regularly than I previously wanted to acknowledge.  It was the first time my husband and I had been away from our twin sons since they were born.  My mother was supposed to watch them and stay the night at our home. Her husband was to sleep elsewhere because he has various medical conditions that cause him to sweat an ungodly amount when he sleeps and we didn't want him to sleep in our new bed due to that. She agreed he would not be sleeping our bed multiple times in the weeks leading up to our mini vacation.  We spent a wonderful night alone camping at a lake and enjoying ourselves without worrying about our children for the first time in two years.  It was definitely a much need relaxing time for us both but when we arrived back home she acted as though everything had went according to plan but I soon realized that was not the case.  Her husband had undoubtedly slept in our new bed thus staining the sheets and our mattress pad and they had both lied dead face to both my husband and I about the situation.  It took a night of soaking and an hour of scrubbing to get the stains out, luckily it didn't soak through to our mattress.  This is not the first she had lied to me and I know it won't be the last.  The best thing I think I can do in this situation is try to limit exposure to her and her husband.  This has a certain level of guilt that comes along with it but I know I'm preventing some major issues by doing so.  It really makes me feel a certain kind of way to know that I cannot trust anyone in my family.  I don't much care for that but it is what it is.  I know one day none of this will matter but right now it definitely appears to."
