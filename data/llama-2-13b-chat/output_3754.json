Perhaps if I show her attention she will soften? I should start giving my all to her and expect nothing in return. Unconditional love was what was missing. Love is something that must remain pure. Must remain without expectations or limitations. Only then can we know if the love is real. Conditional love is not love at all but tolerance. Life is too short for this. This is how I can get my love back. Show her unconditional love. Show her unwavering love. Expect nothing in return for my love."
