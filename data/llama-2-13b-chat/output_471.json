        "Summarize the following story in first person: About three months ago I was involved in a car accident.   The accident happened on the Highway as I was getting onto the entering ramp.  It happened as I got off work.  My shift was late at night.  I worked late that night and I was exhausted and very tired.  It seemed like a normal work night as I cloaked out and proceeded to my truck.  The only thing that was different that night is that I was very tired from working.  Sometimes I take a nap before I drive home.  For some reason I did not take a nap to rest up before I started my trip home.  As I was driving to get on the ramp to the Highway I started to go around the curve of the ramp.  Halfway around the ramp I soon lost control of the truck.  I did not realize the the road was wet.  While I was working it rained a little but I did not noticed.  As I accelerated up the ramp I lost control of the truck.  My steering wheel locked.  My front truck tires locked as well.  As I lost control of my truck it seemed like my entire life flashed before me i those few seconds.  I was really scared.  I hit the guard rail and crashed my back bumper.  I got out of the truck and realized that I was not hurt.  I walked away from the accident unharmed and I am very grateful."
