        "Summarize the following story in first person: Me and my partner got a dog from the street and we like it very much. So we took it to our home and it was with us for six months. We both love our dog very much.  But one day 3 months before, our dog met with an accident.  it was really a great surprise for us and i could not imagine that my dog had met with an accident. It is in very critical stage and i could not even digest that our dog is in a serious condition. It was very much sad to see the dog. We have investigated about the accident and they told that it was met with an accident with another dog. Then we thought that it will get better day by day. I have more hope that it will get ready with few days or weeks. And i was eagerly waiting for the news that our dog is getting better day by day. But the hope did not lat for more time. They have informed that the dog is in a critical stage and it is very hard to recover the dog back to normal. It is very sad and i could not even think of a day without my dog. I was crying loudly and our dog is nearly a family member for me. So i could not imagine a day without our dog. The dogs are the real living thing which have full 100% love on us. So i love him very much. Now he is no more and we have last him and he is in a permanent sleep. I could not be in our home and see the places without him. Every where i see i could see him in all the places.  Now a days i am looking for a small puppy and i have to take care of him like my old dog.  Me and husband is now happily living with our new puppy with our old dog memories. Though we grow up more than 10 dogs i could not forget my first dog who is like my first son and i will be always thinking of him every time. It is a very bitter memory but could be satisfied if i would think of him."
