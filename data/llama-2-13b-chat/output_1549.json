        "Summarize the following story in first person: I will start counting the purchase of my last car:the tragedy that this brought me, was something normal at the beginning, it was the year, used, the first days I am excellent without failures or anything. but for a moment everything was harmful, obviously I bought all the spare parts, but anyway, it is a very expensive car for which I saved too much. I had to sell it as an emergency because. I was about to leave it for a while, and the former owner never wanted to answer me for how damaged the car was when he lied to me saying that it is very, very good. With how little I am saved and how little I could get for the other car I decided to buy an agency. I hope soon to suggest to have many cars, or to have a very high-end vehicle dealerelegance and comfort ... the best of the country. After that, it would be nice to look for a house a little bigger to happen and have a better comfort with my family without giving so many details.\u00a0I remember that there was something that I enjoyed very much, and that I managed to make a trio with a woman from Canada and the other one from here in the countryThey were sincerely beautiful, and they moved like they could have no idea. Maybe that was what caused the car to start damaging so much ... well, I'm not a scientist to know. I liked it, I felt the king of the world. King Kong, everything controlled. Anyway, I hope everything changes and is better. because good things happen to good people. Anyway, that's what I had to tell. thanks for your attention."
