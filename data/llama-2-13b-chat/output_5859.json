        "Summarize the following story in first person: This was a horrible thing for me because I had to stay in this hospital for awhile and it had a pressure bed to notice my movements. I couldn't get out of bed without someone coming to help me. I had to be on a strict diet and they had to take me off medicine slowly to see what that did to me. This was really painful for me because it was boring and I felt really restricted during this time. My friend was with me so it made it a lot harder to sit really because I knew she was bored and wanted to go home. I didn't feel myself the entire time I was there because my medicine was not right that I had been taking for years. I was very uncomfortable because it was really loud in this hospital as well doors were slamming all the time and I couldn't go to sleep. Being confined to a bed is a lot harder then i thought for multiple days. It was a big surprise to me what they found and my medicine had to be changed. It's always scary when I have to go on different medicines for side effects. Or take high dosages of medicine to stop the abnormal brain waves. The doctors were really nice here so that was a little easier. I think they could have made it better with more things for me to do. They could have had specific time for me to get out the bed and walk around. I wouldn't want to do this again it was kind of a nightmare."
