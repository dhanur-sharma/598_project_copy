        "Summarize the following story in first person: Let me tell you a story about a road trip i made with my aunt 3 weeks ago. My aunt and i decided to do a little traveling and considered how we would do this. we thought about taking a train but that would have been a limiting factor if we wanted to make a stop here and there. so Judy (who is my aunt of course) said \"Lets take a road trip instead! it would be fun\" and of course i agreed and off we went. Thought out the course of 8 days we did a ton of sight seeing as well as hiking and some swimming! We stayed at a few 5 star hotels but we rather sleep under the stars so we would set up some tents and star gaze looking for the famous fast streaks in the sky that shooting stars often leave. But the best part of this story is the friends and family we stopped to visit! the first stop we made was at my friends Rudy's house and with out notice because we wanted to to be a surprise. Well guess what? The surprise was on us! Rudy (who is a long time friend Judy and i) was getting married! And was throwing a party that night (we were dipping into the punch bowl more then once might i add) but that's not the exciting part, he is getting married to my sister! No one told me about it because they wanted it to be a surprise using this magical road trip i went on.  so in the following days Judy and i continued to stop at some more friends houses before we attended the wedding. Let me tell, you it was the most amazing wedding i ever attended. we threw more rice that day then we could of possibly eaten in a year. At the reception, we danced till we dropped an let me tell you my legs were soooo sore the next day i could of stayed in bed for a week! Judy and i had an absolute blast at the wedding and a day to remember for the rest of our lives. In conclusion Judy an i do plan on another road trip but that is all i will say for now but you will want to tune in for that trip because we plan on something very special!"
