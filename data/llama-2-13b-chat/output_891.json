        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was late summer, and my wife was getting crabby. The humidity, our two-year-old son and one-year-old Jack Russell Terrier had long begun to wear on her two-weeks-overdue body. To our delight, that crescendo of fatigue, discomfort and anticipation was short lived. Baby Abigail, \"Abbie\" (or as we call her \"Abbie P\" - the P is for \"peanut\") was born In early September, just in time to cut short our Labor Day picnic. Abbie's brother, Sam, fell in love with his baby sister from the moment he laid eyes on her. I would hold her down where he could go nose to nose with her but not get too rough. Sometimes when Pam was breastfeeding, Sam would give them both a knowing grin, as it was in the not too far distant past that he enjoyed such nutritive and bonding moments with his mom. Vivian the Jack Russell went bonkers when she saw the new addition to her little people posse. More than once we found her resting her head on Abbie's carrier, gazing at her as she slept, with a longing look for the day that Abbie would be able to scoot around like Sam. Pam and I are, needless to say, overjoyed. We wanted one of each, a family of four. In fact, the day we met in Westerly 5 years ago, we talked about how many children each of us would like to have and our answers matched. Funny for a first encounter, perhaps, but the beach was warm, the drinks were colorful and tequila-heavy, and our mutual group of friends decided love and marriage would be the topic on such a sultry day. Today our cocktails have become coffee, the dark roast blend we need to answer the call of kid and canine alike. When the kids get a little older, we'd like to buy a little summer cottage on one of the side streets near Misquamicut. They can build castles in the sand, the dog can catch a Frisbee, and Pam and I can happily remember the first day of the start of our family, again and again."
