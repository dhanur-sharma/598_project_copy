        "Summarize the following story in first person: So this is a story about day, the death of my grandfather. So the town was all riled up for this speech by Trump. And you know the funniest thing was that I don't even remember what that big orange shit stains speech was about. I'm a moderate conservative, and the way he's been running business sits uneasy with me. Anyways, just the week prior to all this the mine in the outskirts of the town collapsed, killing a lot of good folk. Lot of good men died on that day, its a damn shame actually. Trumps cronies were setting up shop in town  that morning, getting the podium out of wherever they store it at city hall and hanging a few half hearted flags behind the stage. I was out there myself you know. I'm part of the committee so I figured I should just be there, though there wasn't much for me to do. I'd say it was about 0630 in the morning when I got the call that changed my life really. Grandpa had run up to the mine and gotten himself killed. That's all I got before my brother hung up. I don't even remember the next few moments I just started running. The mine entrance wasn't that far and there was a small crowd there. Grandpa was crushed underneath a rock, thankfully already dead. I say thankfully because if he hadn't been the way he was pinned looked hella awful. Trump actually did mention it during the speech later that afternoon. That a hero had died trying to get his buddies out. I was pretty surprised, like it had happened literally just an hour or two before. What did he even care? Grandpa was just senile though, he didn't know what was what."
