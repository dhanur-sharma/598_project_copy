        "Summarize the following story in first person: A mutual friend has introduced me to this guy during some bar outing one night. We hit it off pretty well and decided to keep in touch after that day. We talked on the phone on a few, exchanged a few texts. Nothing serious or crossing the line. This was a very platonic friendship that never gave off the vibes of it being anything else. One night during some bar hopping, I had bumped into my friends who so happen to be really good friends with this guy. He had been with them that night, but left to explore the nearby bars. One of his buddies called him to let him know that they had seen me there and if I wanted to come out and say hi. We all hung out for a bit and later one by one people started going their own ways. I stayed being to hang out with him. We talked, had a few drinks. The conversations went from seriousness to playful and back to seriousness. He knew I had a boyfriend and I was aware that he wanted to be intimate with me. Leaning in as we sat there drinking, he kissed me. I didn't stop him, but I also didn't react by moving my lips. Just allowed him to place his over mine and kiss me. Hit me in that moment how unhappy I was with my current boyfriend. It was the kiss that grew some spell on me. The kiss only solidified a truth that I had buried deep down because I was afraid of moving on from my relationship."

We just looked at each other and it was like the whole bar faded away. I knew I was going to have to make a decision about my relationship. I had been unhappy for a while and I had been thinking about moving on. I knew that I had found someone who made me feel alive and wanted. We talked for a bit more and he walked me back to my car. I thanked him for the kiss and told him I had to go. He smiled and said he would be waiting for me. I drove home with my heart racing and my mind made up. I knew I had to end my relationship. It was time to move on and see where this new connection would take me."
