        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was night time. I was in bed getting ready to fall asleep. My brother came in and sat on the edge of the bed. He told me that Pa had passed. I couldn't speak. I just stared up at the ceiling and tried to muffle my cries. When my brother left, I went outside to go to my uncle's house. After I calmed down over there, I went back home. The emotions hit me again. I spent most of the night crying and couldn't fall asleep. I even tried taking a sleeping pill, but it didn't help. I just kept thinking about how he was gone and what all I should have done and said. I couldn't believe that he had passed away, especially since I had seen him only a couple days before. I knew he was getting older and that the time was coming, but it still took me by surprise. I just wish I could talk to him one more time."
