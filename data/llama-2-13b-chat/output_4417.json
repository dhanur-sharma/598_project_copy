        "Summarize the following story in first person: I never thought the day would actually come! After waiting nine months, and talking about him, planning for him and preparing our lives for him, my son has finally arrived! There was nothing like the sensation of actually meeting him for the first time. We knew his name before he was born. We had picked toys. We selected things for him to wear. Everything culminated to this one day. It was possibly one of the happiest moments of my life, finally meeting him. My wife and I were overcome with joy. It was a long and hard pregnancy. There were many problems and scares, but we made it out in the end. Looking into my sons eyes and hearing his voice for the first time was absolutely astounding. A new member of our family, someone to share our love with. The road forward is paved with fun, expectations, fear, and uncertainty. I hope that I can live up to his expectations as much as he will assuredly live up to mine."
