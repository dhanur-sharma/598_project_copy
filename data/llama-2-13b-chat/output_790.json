        "Summarize the following story in first person: Just about 5 months ago now, I reached an all time low. I had been unemployed by then for six months after an unexpected layoff. I was turning in applications everywhere and not so much as receiving a call back in return. I had no one to help me in the immediate area and my meager savings was running out fast. I was having to consider selling my car or sell blood or something to make ends meet. My outlook on life shifted and I was beginning to lose hope. I had a friend out of nowhere reach out to me one weekend offering me a position where she works in an office for the sewer plant. The job didn't pay much and I was kind of embarrassed to go to work for the sewer plant of all places. I was kind ready to brush off the offer but something told me to just check it anyway. So I did. On the following Monday, I came into the office for an interview. I immediately felt at ease. The office was small and very friendly. It turns out a couple of people I knew from the lay off had acquired jobs at the office as well. My interview went great, which never happens for me. I was offered a bump up on the pay due to past experience. The benefits that were offered far exceeded my expectations. I took the job before leaving. I've now been working at the plant for awhile and things couldn't be better. I'm being trained for a supervisor role and have made some really good friends while on the job. I couldn't ask for more. This has been the answer to my prayers."
