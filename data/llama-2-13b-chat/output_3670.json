        "Summarize the following story in first person: I had to take my youngest child John to school, his first day of school in kindergarten. As I woke him up for us to both get ready for this day, I woke him up and was already wondering, where had the time gone? Seems like yesterday I was with my wife in that delivery room watching Johnny laying there in his mothers arms. This 5 years has flown by, watching him start to crawl and eventually seeing him take his first steps. Incredible what a little perseverance and time can do. As we got ready I made him his favorite breakfast and waited in the living room as he brushed his teeth. When I looked at the clock and realized we were running late. Shout to John we have to get going as he grabs his backpack and we escape out the door and get into the car. Finally getting to his school and walking inside to drop him off, I realize something is off, he looks teary eyed. Ask him if he is okay and he starts quietly sobbing saying he doesn't want me to leave him. I get down on my knees and tell him he's going to be okay and these teachers are going to take care of him. A teacher notices what is happening and comes over in a very cheery tone saying \"hey! you can't be sad! This is fun! your first day of school!\" John stops crying as the lady hands him a stuffed dinosaur. He smiles and she pulls him off to go meet his new classmates I see him laughing and looking at the teacher as he gets farther. My mind is calm knowing that he is in good hands, but I still can't help but feel a little sad as I leave the school alone without my little man. The minutes felt like hours when he was at school nervously waiting for some disastrous phone call that never came. It was time to pick him up and I did, when I arrived he had the brightest smile on his face as he jumped in my arms, the words couldn't fall out of his mouth fast enough. All the new friends he made, the funny mishaps in class, all the new things he learned already on his first day. That was two weeks ago. We now have a much more streamlined schedule for his school, the sadness is gone and has been taken up by excitement. Sobs turned into laughter, tears turned into stories. His first steps into becoming a free thinking human who can have more autonomy, and not need someone by his side at all times."
