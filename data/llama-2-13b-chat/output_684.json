        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was a normal day in the middle of the week when I decided to go to Santander Bank to withdraw some cash and then go to Wegman's. I was intending to go get some food, but it was also the only opportunity I had to smoke marijuana outside of the house. This is because I couldn't do it while my dad was home. So I went in my brother's car and drove through a small route I normally go for discretion. On the way I put small amount of cannabis in my pipe and smoked a little while driving. At that point I decided I should drive around and listen to music, then I should go to the bank. I took a long route around, and noticed at some point a cop car ended up behind me. I was nervous, thinking they might have known what I did. While I was nearing the bank, the cop car was still behind me, and eventually started flashing its lights. I thought I was surely done for, and as the two cops walked up after I had parked in a Barnes & Noble parking lot I thought I might have a panic attack. To my surprise, I was acting calm enough as they stated the reason they pulled me over is because the car was unregistered for a couple months. I didn't have up-to-date documentation and had to call my dad to get me a picture of proof of insurance, but it was surely better than them noticing any wrongdoing. Throughout the ordeal they didn't suspect anything, as I had hidden away anything suspicious and there was no smell. I was very lucky that day, especially considering I had illegal narcotics within reach in the car. I believe this will be the last time I do something so suspect on the road. At the very least, it will be the last time I smoke weed on the road."
