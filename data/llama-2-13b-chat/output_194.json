        "Summarize the following story in first person: After my son was born in 2016, I lived with my parents for a couple years. I got married and my husband moved in with us, and we decided to have another baby in January of 2018. During that time, my Dad was diagnosed with early signs of dementia. It was a hard time for all of us. He was mostly bed ridden and having other complications as well. He survived skin cancer 2 different times and was missing part of his nose and mouth from it. He started to be very mean to my son at random times because of the dementia and it got very tough and stressful. We were ALL on edge about it. My husband who lived with us as well, decided that we were moving out because of it. When we told them the news, everyone got into an argument and it got VERY heated. It was mostly my husband that made the decision, so my parents took all the anger out on him. We moved out. And I was in very little to no contact with them. During that time, my Dad passed away from a heart attack.  I would give anything to go back in time and tell him that I love him."
