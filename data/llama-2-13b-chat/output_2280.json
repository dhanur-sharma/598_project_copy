        "Summarize the following story in first person: On May 10, 2017 I graduated from a 4-year college. During those 4 years I made plenty of long-life friendships. My freshman year I was able to be a part of one of best Bands in the South. My Junior Year I got to join my favorite sorority. I got to make lifelong friendship and sisterhood from my sorority.  Goring up I struggled in Middle school all the way to Highschool and didn\u2019t think that I wanted to go to college. I was diagnosed with ADD in Highschool cause i knew my attention wasn\u2019t always there. I ended up doing great things my senior year in high school after being diagnosed my junior year. But I went for it and didn\u2019t let anything hold me back from accomplishing my dreams. I was nervous when I started and scared but i graduated with a 3.0. This is a memorable moment for me because I completed college on time within 4 years with a degree in Psychology and a Minor in Human Service and the accomplishments that I\u2019ve done throughout college. I always wanted to help people and children. My goal is to go back and get my master\u2019s in social work. But the will be a while from now. My dreams came true and I have the best support system anyone could ever ask for."
