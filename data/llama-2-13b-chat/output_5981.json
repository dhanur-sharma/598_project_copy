        "Summarize the following story in first person: Four months ago I got the Head Cashier position. I had applied three other times before and was rejected. I never gave up at it. I kept working hard and applied again each time. I feel like all the effort has paid off. I'm happy that I'm not the Head Cashier. I feel a lot of responsibility and prestige with this position. I want to move up in this company and this is just the first step. I want to be in upper management. If I keep up my hard work and effort I will soon be there. I just have to keep my goal in my mind and apply myself. Soon enough I will be able to move up again. I want to show this company my potential. I'm now in this position and I feel I've accomplished a lot in the short time. I know that I can become anything I want to be now. It's up to me on how far my future goes."
