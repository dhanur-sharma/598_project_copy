        "Summarize the following story in first person: Two months ago I finally had enough of my awful, filthy room mates. Sarah was so messy, she would make food and eat it on the couch with no napkin or tray, so of course crumbs would get everywhere. It wouldn't have made me so mad had she at least vacuumed afterwards but no, she made no effort to clean. This is on top of coming home from work every night to seeing John's laundry strewn about the apartment, piled in the halls and filthy. I tried to communicate to them, I really did.. We held apartment meetings, created chore lists; they would agree to start picking up after themselves, and to their credit they would.....for a week! Then it was right back to being filthy, dirty, nasty, messy all over again! Now, I'm not a clean freak but come on... live like humans, not animals! Last month they where both late on rent by a whole 2 weeks, I was able to cover it and told them they had to pay me back by the 14th. Well, the 14th came and I asked again for the rent money, I was told to stop bugging them about it and they'd get it...Apparently John didn't stop off at the bank after work.... Yea? Right! I couldn't take it anymore. I just said, \"OK, that's fine.\" My name was thankfully NOT on the lease, it was in Sarah's as she had better credit, so I didn't have to worry about breaking contract. I called into my job the next day, packed my things and moved in with my sister for a few weeks as I got back on my feet. I am now in my very own apartment, it's small but it works for me. I can afford my necessities  and make due just barely scraping by. But I'm happy now, I'm not as stressed, I don't have a huge mess to clean up everyday and although I'm in debt from having to use my credit cards to help me through this first month, I'd rather be in debt because of my actions, not because my room mates/\"\"friends\" didn't help pay bills. It sucks though, Sarah and I used to be best friends, and now we hardly talk. I'll never move in with friends again, not for a long time anyway, especially if I can make it on my own. When you start living with someone everyday, what you thought was tolerable or cute eventually becomes annoying and even mildly aggravating; and unless we can talk about it, it only gets worse. I think I've learned my lesson now. I'm focusing on myself and what I need to do, the future looks hard but bright."
