        "Summarize the following story in first person: Around two months ago, my son laughed for the first time. It was exceedingly unexpected, and floored me. I had been sitting at my desk, with him sitting on my desk. I do this regularly, and was talking to him like I normally do. Out of nowhere, he started giggling! He's two months premature so I've been incredibly worried about his cognitive development. There was a chance the brain bleed he had when he was in the NICU would negatively impact his cognitive function. So when the time rolled around that he was \"supposed\" to be socially laughing and wasn't, I had a sense of dread and worry. Hearing him laugh brought tears to my eyes, and it took all I had not to break down crying. He hit it out of the park and has been consistently socially laughing ever since that moment. I have other concerns about his development, though. I don't know how long it'll take me to shake the fear. I can only hope that my fears don't see reality. I'm so proud of my little boy, though, no matter what. I will always love and cherish everything he has accomplished so far in his short little life."
