        "Summarize the following story in first person: it was a fine morning when we all woke up early  enough for the big day. Everyone was all smiles since we were really waited for this particular day my sister was going to get married to her long time lover martin. Martin the spouse was a good guy with a high dignity and a lot of respect,we all loved him and he loved us back. The day is here everyone looks so sharp and bright. my sister is happy as she prepares for her big day,i personally i am happy and i was one of the maids. When we are done preparing we went outside to take some nice pictures with beautiful poses. At the church even the congregation is all smiles as they take the vows and nothing goes wrong. At the reception the place is well decorated and the theme of the wedding is maroon and beige and they look so beautiful. We eat to our fullest and dance the whole afternoon together with the newly weds. The evening was so romantic,everyone was in white and the evening was so bright. We drank expensive wines and when everyone is all high we dance again i partners. we made the evening so sweet for my sister. the day is done and everyone is tired now. The newly weds prepare themselves for their honeymoon in Bahamas and everyone else leaves at their own pleasure. I went home really tired together with my husband and enjoy our night. the following day i called my sister to know if they reached safe and they confirmed they are all good. I settled and went through the pictures and they looked so awesome. i am all happy for her wedding they are now three months old married."
