        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was early in the Morning, about 5 am. I usually wake up for work around 7 AM but today I was awoken by the sound of someone sobbing hysterically. It was my brother. My  brother suffers from chronic depression and is believed to  be bipolar. I could already tell  my brother was going  to have a  manic episode that day. So i thought i would take a shower early before he was able to lock me  into  a conversation and i  would have to speak to my  brother and look into the eyes of a brother i had lost years ago. In order to understand my situation, as the reader you have to understand that his manic episodes come in packages; Anger, Sadness and euphoria. I wasnt sure what emotion was  going to come out tooday so i decided to get in the  shower. As im getting  in the shower the dooor knob starts to rattle. I immediately know its my  brother but i act like i dont know who  it is. \"hello!?\" i call out. The doorknob begins to rattle even more viciously than before. i call out once more and bang the door \"HELLO!?\". As i open the door because the rattling wont stop its my brother, or is a shell of what he once was. He is unshaven, 100 lbs overweight and smells and looks like he hasnt showered in a week. I tell him  \"dude what the fuck?\" but he just stares at me and doesnt say a word. after about 10 seconds of awkward silence he says  \"im going to work today fucker\" and leaves me with an manical smille. My parents left that day for vegas for vacation. The next couple of days are some of the most horrifying days of my life."

He would call my parents and tell them that i was trying to kill him. He would call my boss and tell them that i wasnt showing up to work. He even went so far as to call the cops on me because i had the audacity to tell him that he was not well. I tried to reach out to him to see if he was okay but he wouldnt pick up my calls or my texts. He was in full blown manic mode. He would stay up for days on end and would only sleep for 30 minutes at a time. He would send me pictures of him with new tattoos that he had gotten. He would tell me that he was going to get a new job and that he was going to be a millionare. He would tell me that he was going to buy me a new car. I knew that he wasnt well but i also knew that i couldnt do anything to help him. I had to just sit and watch as my brother went through this. It was horrifying and heartbreaking all at once.
