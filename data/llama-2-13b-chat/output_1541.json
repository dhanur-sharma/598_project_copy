        "Summarize the following story in first person: I have always loved surprises but sadly i have just had a few in my lifetime. My birthday was fast approaching and i was really enthusiastic about it , i tried so hard not to remind my husband about it because i felt he had something in mind and it would ruin the surprise. That day finally came and i was totally excited right from the moment i opened my eyes. But my excitement was ephemeral because ,my husband didn't even seem to notice me that day , he had this kind of stern look on his face and told me that he would be travelling that same day. I was totally flabbergasted. I was almost tempted to remind him but i was already pissed that he didn't even remember it was my birthday. All my hopes for a surprise party just came crashing down. After he left the house i prepared the kids for school, didn't really expect them to remember though , still felt it would be cool if they did. I set out for work and had divided attention because i felt my phone would ring anytime and i would have my hubby sing a birthday song for me.  What i got was more and more work , my supervisor gave me loads of work and my colleagues who always gave me birthday wishes didn't even  seem to notice me. I later gave up and said to myself well , \"This should be the worst birthday ever\".When i got home , i was exhausted and famished , on entering the door i had a loud shout of \"Happy birthday\", i can say i literally ran off my skin , tears of joy overwhelmed me .I was totally swept off my feet , to my surprise i saw my husband , which i later knew he was feigning the serious look and the travel plan , i was really excited ,my colleagues and supervisor were all there. What was really memorable was the birthday song my kids sang for me and the flowers they presented and also the fact that my mom was able to make it despite the fact that she was critically ill.  I received loads of gift from my husband and some items when i earlier did some window shopping with him was given to me. I really had the best time of my life and had so much fun. This is the best and most memorable and surprising birthday party i have ever had ; thanks to my lovely husband and kids ."
