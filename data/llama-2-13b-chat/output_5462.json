        "Summarize the following story in first person: One day in my apartment, i was sleeping until i heard a loud bang on the door. I thought it was the front door and it was the mailman so i ignored it. The banging got increasingly louder and my roommate decided to open the door. All of a sudden police came through and were looking for someone. Apparently my other roommate who was in New York at the time was associated with a known gang member. The police questioned me and asked me if knew the gang members whereabouts. I told them no and i told them i had only met the suspect once and it was very briefly  The police went through my room and quickly searched around. They then asked me if i knew my roommates number and i disclosed it to them so they could leave me alone and i could get back to my sleep. They left and i called my roommate letting them know they were looking for her and the suspect. She was in obvious shock and i let her know how serious the situation. I went to bed and slept the rest of the morning but that memory of the police raiding my apartment has not left me. I disclosed this info to my parents to let them know what i've gone through. I disclosed to my friends at work and they were shocked that this happened to me. I still think about it from time to time. i'll never look at police the same."
