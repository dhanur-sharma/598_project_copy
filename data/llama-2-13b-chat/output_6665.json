        "Summarize the following story in first person: Dear Diary,It  has been a very busy month so far.  The new Year kicked off with my parents visiting from the United Kingdom.  I had not seen them in such a long time.  It had been  about 2 years.  When they arrived at the airport it was nice to see the min the flesh.  We went back to our apartment and they had some gifts for us.  My parents gave me a Diamond Necklace that had once belonged to my grandmother and it was beautiful.  I was extremely happy.  This was to celebrate my birthday.  As soon as they gifted that my Spouse said \"Hey look out the window and I got up and looked out the window and there was a new car sitting in the driveway with a bow on it.  I was super pleased as i had been driving my previous car and it had broken down.  It was a wonderful week with everyone in the apartment.  My parents left yesterday and it was sad to see them go.  Today is bittersweet as I just learned that my friend I met three years ago  passed away.  I am very sad but at least she died peacfully."
