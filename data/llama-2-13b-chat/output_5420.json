        "Summarize the following story in first person: Vacation Bible School really was a blast. They act on the outside like it's about church and religion, but it's really more like regular camp and a few hours in the morning focus on religion. The rest is like regular camp. So it's really like just hanging out with your friends from school and church. It's a big hookup time during the summer. Sort of more than school time because not as many classes and studies getting in the way. Brian and Lila got together and broke up at least 3 times over the summer. Kyle must have hooked up with no less than 5 girls during that time. He's like everyone's first. He's great, but someone to never get a crush on, he's so not sticking around. Nicole and Adam are going strong, they've been together forever it feels like and I'm guessing they'll get married right after college. I like Jason a lot, but nothing really happened with him more than just basic flirting. But he's just a year ahead of me in school, so maybe eventually we'll go out. But that's mostly all we did at Vacation Bible School, it's like a big social event. Glad I didn't miss out on it. The religion part is a drag since I'm totally not into it, but my parents want to push that on me while they can. Luckily it ended up being fun hanging out with my friends even though I'm not here for the official bible and church stuff like that."
