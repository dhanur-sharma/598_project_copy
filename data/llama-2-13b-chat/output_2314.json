        "Summarize the following story in first person: I've heard people say before that life is a journey. What they don't say is what type of journey it really is. When I first married Rod almost 22 years ago, I had no idea what I was in store for. Sure, I knew I'd be moving in with someone for the first time, so I'd lost some of my autonomy. We'd argued before, and I knew we'd argue again in the future. The wedding vows confirmed that we were joined together for richer or poorer. No matter how high we went, we'd be together. But I had no idea just how high or low those things would take us. For our 22nd anniversary yesterday, Rod surprised me with a series of trips that illustrated just how we've gone on that journey together. We first went out on a boat to symbolize the start of our journey: setting sail. After we'd sailed out far enough, we jumped in the water and started to swim around. That was to represent when, early in our marriage, I miscarried, and we realized that things wouldn't always be so easy. There were times we'd have to swim together ourselves, doing the hard work ourselves. After we'd tired ourselves out, we hopped back on the boat and had a picnic. This one was to remember that whenever we're taxed for events like that, we'll always have the fruit of our marriage to nourish and sustain us. We had a lot of fruit on the way back, actually. And then he finished up with something I couldn't have imagined: a hot air balloon ride at sunset with champagne and all. It was in recognition of our commitment - no, our promise - to sail off into the sunset together. It's going to be a good life, another good 22 years...just as it always has with him."
