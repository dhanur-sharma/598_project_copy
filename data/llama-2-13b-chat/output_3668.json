        "Summarize the following story in first person: Growing up, it was me and my sister. I was her big bro and I took care of her. As we got older, she got into a lot of trouble. She stopped wanting me around. Stopped wanting me to look out for her. Eventually I gave up and gave her what she wanted. That is the biggest regret of my life. 3 months ago I found out that she has liver failure. This was due to alcoholism that she has been suffering with for years now. I flew back to see her. She looked weak. In pain. Feeble. Ashamed. I went to her hospital bed and she told me she was dying. She didn't have long. I cried quietly and told her I was sorry. I failed her. She smiled and told me there was nothing I could do. This life is really painful sometimes. It almost makes me wonder why it's even worth it. Then I think of my children and I remember that life doesn't have to be pain. It can be so much more. I love my sister."
