        "Summarize the following story in first person: We were always worried about her. When she was born she had this diagnosis of having mild down syndrome. The wife and I were shocked. We completed a number of testing beforehand. Everything we saw showed up as almost no chance of any mental development issues. I know that these tests aren't perfect. It was discussed at length and we did a lot of research. Our doctor went over it a bunch of times. We were thoroughly convinced that she would be born without any sort of these problems. Sure enough, by about age 1 or so, she showed signs of being, different. We were concerned so we took her in to a specialist. They did a battery of testing that took a few months. At first they figured it was just a simple case of her taking a bit longer than most kids learning simple things. But then the diagnosis came back with downs syndrome. We worked with a number of therapists and behavior experts for a few years. Slowly and surely, the outward signs were almost gone and we were very happy about this. Sure enough, now that she is in 1st grade, there's nothing that one can see to tell you that she has this disorder. She is just like any normal kid and even though she technically has downs, she has thus far battled over all of the hurdles that it presented. This is why we are so darn proud of her. She worked very hard to get here. I hope this continues but at this very moment, we are beyond thrilled about this whole thing. We literally could not be happier for her"
