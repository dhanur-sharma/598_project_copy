        "Summarize the following story in first person: I have a good solving skill in my work place. Having a good creative skills in designing software. Though this is the production company where we use some of the 3D modelling software. I'm the junior among all the staff members and have a good name in working skills. So there started more jealous on me among my seniors. At that time a challenging obstacle came to me, which was created by my seniors in my work place. The problem was to solve the query of the customer end, which was done by one of my seniors and they showed their hand on me. So, here I have to face it. I thought that respecting seniors is the best way to overcome a situation and so suddenly I called upon my college professors to ask for doubts to solve it curiously. They helped me in many ways, as I respect them till now. And finally I solved the problem in a meeting arranged by my Employer, whom he was wondered to see me, solving the queries of the customer end. That leads me in good direction. My Employer came forward and promote me to a higher position. All the seniors present there were shocked to me see me in that particular situation. Even thought they are jealous on me, they appreciated me in the success."
