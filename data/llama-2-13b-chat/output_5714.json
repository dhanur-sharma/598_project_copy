        "Summarize the following story in first person: The scariest thing happened to me a couple months ago.  I had a tree that was dying and in danger of falling in my front yard.  I have been told sometimes these dying trees are referred to as 'widow-makers' because they have been known to fall over on a whim and cause fatal accidents.  After learning that, I decided the safest thing to do would be to chop it down preemptively.  I used a chainsaw and this was my first time using this tool as well as my first time cutting down a tree.  Well, I learned my lesson because the tree fell down in the wrong direction and almost killed me anyways.  The one thing I was trying to prevent in the first place.  This came as a total shock because I did not even consider this being a possibility to watch out for.  I should have watched a youtube instructional video first!  As usual, I thought I could handle anything and did not need to research such a \"simple task\" before hand.  I was wrong. I always expected my life to flash before my eyes in an event like this.  However, this was not the case because it all happened so fast.  The dang tree almost was a widow-maker after all.  Next time I will hire a professional (or so my spouse insists)."
