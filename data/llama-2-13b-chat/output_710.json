She ordered a laptop that is worth almost a thousand dollars. It is super nice. It has a touch screen and a very nice video card. This way she watch movies on it. The whole reason she wanted to buy a laptop is so that she can run her online business from it. Well, this laptop can do that and more. It has really worked out for her. She really loves that laptop.
