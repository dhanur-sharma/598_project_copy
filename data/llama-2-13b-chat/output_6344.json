        "Summarize the following story in first person: In my darkest moment, 48 hours before my son's delivery, my wife has been in labour for over 24 hours. The doctor confirmed that she was due for delivery but we all stayed and waited. I felt bad because my wife has been in pains for long. I could not watch her anymore so I sat on a worn sofa in front of the ward, Jamie her best friend was there as well with  hospital chaplain who is a family friend. Jamie was crying, the chaplain was praying, and I was feeling utterly, nauseatingly helpless. I had never felt such shock, such numbing fear. My vision was blurred, my hearing seemed muffled, and I couldn't comprehend what was happening in the intensive care unit. The doctors aided my wife Katherine with an oxygen to help her out. I was so confused that I was no longer picking anyone's call because I did not want to loose my wife and unborn son. The doctors were really pumping air into wife saying you can do this try harder and I was hearing my wife screaming ral hard and this made me shed tears.  Did I really hear the doctor say \"CT scan\" I was so scared. One of the doctors stepped out and spoke to me telling me that they would have to run an operation for my wife's safe delivery and I quickly told him to do all what he needs to do so my wife can have the safest of delivery. I rushed home so I could get her goodluck charm as she demanded I should get it for her. I drove as fast as I could so I can be back at the hospital soonest. I go home and immediately I was about to leave the house I got a call from Jamie I thought the worst has happened I was sounding very scared, then Jamies said congrats that Kathering just delivered a bouncing baby boy. I felt so complete. I rushed back to the hospital to see my healthy son whom we named Franklin"
