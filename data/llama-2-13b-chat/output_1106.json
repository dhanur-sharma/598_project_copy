        "Summarize the following story in first person: Recently I have been taking my dog to a local park that is connected to a cemetery in order to let her stretch her legs and hunt for squirrels. We are constantly pulling in there and roaming around the whole area, but we very infrequently meet other dogs and their owners while we are in the back woods area of the park. A few months ago, in the spring of this year, we were following the same course as always and we came upon a dog running loose with a collar and tags on its neck. It stopped and was friendly, then continued along the way by itself. Shortly after, me and my dog ran into the owner of the one we had just met, and he was walking another dog on a leash. We said hello to each other and had a brief conversation. I could see that the dog he had on the leash was ill in some way, as opposed to the other healthy dog that was running free. We said goodbye and continued on our separate ways along the trail. A couple of days later, we ran into the same person at the same park but in a different section of the trail. I got to talk to her for a while about how her dog was going to have to have a tumor removed. It was so heartrending to witness an older dog and what getting ill and dying really entails. I was very touched by the whole situation, and I gave her dog a big hug since he was so adorable. After that we did not stay in touch with each other by phone or anything, but I promised to say hi the next time I ran into her there at the park. Sure enough we talked again just a couple of weeks later, and I saw the stitches and the bald spot from the surgery her dog underwent. He was doing well and was happy to meet my dog again, and the two of them ran around until eventually her other dog came back over as well. I felt personally touched by my direct experience with this poor dog, and I also felt good because I was able to contribute to his getting better by sharing some CBD dog treats with his owner. The next time I talked to her, she said that they seemed to have a positive effect on him and that she wanted to thank me for telling her about it."
