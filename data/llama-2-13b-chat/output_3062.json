        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was my best friends 50th wedding anniversary, but we decided to call it a reunion of old friends. They had invited us, but my husband and I didn't know if we would be able to make it. My husband had been feeling ill since the start of the year, but he convinced me it was important to go. We decided to drive instead of flying, and the excuse was to see friends we hadn't seen in decades. When we got there, we saw so many faces of people we were so close to ages ago. Then, something just hit us, and it felt like we were in our 20's again! The music started playing, people stopped talking and hit the dance floor. I hadn't seen my husband move like that since our wedding night (August 4th of 1972)! Maybe it was the alcohol, but he seemed to be having such a great time, it was almost too good to be true! The DJ was playing the best 70's music, he food was fantastic, and it felt like I had been transported back to the golden years. When all was said and done, I profusely thanked my best friend, and my husband and I danced our way back to the hotel, without any music. I hadn't felt this way in years, what a wonderful feeling. I went to bed worried that we would feel the effects of the party the next day, but we woke up with springs in our step. All was wonderful. I can't wait until my friend hosts another party like that, we'll definitely make it a priority to attend it again!"
