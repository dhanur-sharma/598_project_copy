        "Summarize the following story in first person: I shouldn't have stayed out so late drinking on Friday. I knew Dave's nephew was having a birthday party the next day and that we had been invited. Honestly though I did not expect to be out so late. I ran into some old friends though and lost track of the time. Saturday morning when Dave woke me up I seriously considered tell him I was too sick to go. My had was throbbing and I was definitely feeling nauseous.  I however, decided to be a responsible adult and drag my self out of bed. Bill was a sweet kid and I knew he really wanted his uncle to be there. To be honest I was pretty miserable for most of the ride. The car was definitely not helping my nausea but I eventually fell a sleep, which I'm sure was a relief to Dave. Thankfully I was feeling better when I woke up. When we arrived I was glad to see it seemed to be a small family gathering so not a bunch of screaming kids. There were some yard games  set up like darts and volleyball. Bill's dad had the grill set up and seemed to be cooking up a feast which was great cause I was starving now. Before long The whole family was playing a spirited game of darts, kids against adults of course. This was followed by a wonderful meal and cake of course. By evening things had quieted down and the kids and adults enjoyed making smores in the backyard. In the end I had a wonderful time and am glad I decided to go."
