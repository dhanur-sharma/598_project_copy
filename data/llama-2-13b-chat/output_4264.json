        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 3 months ago I went to one of my best friends wedding. I had to take a trip about a hour and a half out of town to go to it. It was a nice drive and I really enjoyed the peace of the drive up to the venue. I'm always happy to see my friends happy and to see them make new steps in their lives and find someone that cares for them. I was really happy to see so many old familiar faces there too. Some people look exactly the same as I remember them, most of them aged really well and look great. This isn't the first wedding I've went to with someone from our friend group, It always reminds me how I'm a little behind in that department. I haven't found anyone that cares for me or that I care for enough to make such a big commitment to. I know all my friends are hoping for me to find that special someone in the same way that they have. I know I will eventually, It will just take time. I saw the \"one that got away\" at the wedding too. She still seems like she hasn't found anyone either. We talked for a bit and maybe might get together for dinner in the next week. I know better than to get my hopes up about such things. I was really surprised that she was the one who suggested getting together."
