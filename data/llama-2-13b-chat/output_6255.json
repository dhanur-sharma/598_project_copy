        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last month, I experienced dating for the first time in over a decade.  After being married for 12 years, I truly thought that my last \"first date\" was behind me.  That all changed when my husband filed divorce papers seemingly out of the blue.  I was shocked and saddened by what felt like a betrayal, and took over a year on self-reflection before feeling confident enough to put myself out there again.  It was still a nerve wracking experience - I didn't feel like I knew \"how\" to date at this point since I was so out of practice.  What do you ask?  What should they ask you?  Despite my fears, I accepted a first date offer from someone I met through an on-line dating site; cliche, I know.  I chose a dress that I thought would make me feel more at ease and we settled on a small dinner club in the area.  We met at the restaurant and ordered drinks.  I had a cosmo, he went for a beer.  The drink made me feel a little more at ease and we got to talking about our past.  It turns out that we had a lot more in common than I would have guessed.  His sister even worked at the same company as my brother!  We finished off the dinner with a shared creme brulee, but weren't ready for the night to end.  We decided to head out to a local bar to continue getting to know each other.  That was our last stop for the first date - but I definitely sense a second one coming up soon."
