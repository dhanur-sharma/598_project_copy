It was in front of the the mall directory. We were both looking for the same place, Godivas Chocolates. We are both chocolate lovers. We ended up noticing each other at the directory looking for the same place, and meeting up again at the actual chocolate store. We made small chit chat and ended up exchanging numbers. We ended up buying the same set of chocolates too. Later that year after many chocolate box exchanges, we decided to get married. We went to Hershey Pennsylvania to get married at the chocolate factory area. We had lots of fun that day, and we ate lots of chocolate. Our cake was, yes, chocolate. With lots of chocolate on top too. It was a memorable day."
