        "Summarize the following story in first person: 3 months ago it was the hottest summer on record. I was sweating up a storm, couldnt go outside. I found little to do, I was miserable inside. But then I had an idea! I wanted my friends to come to me, I had a pool, I had a grill--we could have a fun day for once in a while on our day off! The 4th of July! So, I invited all my friends over for a big 4th of July party, and it was a massive success! There was a large turnout of almost everyone I knew. We laughed, we had fun, we ate. It was miserably hot, sure, but I had a pool to cool ourselves off! My friends brought their families, so there was a lack of space. However, we did manage to fit everyone in. I managed to at least talk to everyone once, even their kids. I wanted everyone to feel included, you know? But, yes, it was an exciting and fun day."
