        "Summarize the following story in first person: Well, since writing that original entry that I'm supposed to refer to, my divorce has been finalized. It's been 17 days since it was finished. I'm still heartbroken and completely lost in terms of the direction my life takes from here. I made the gigantic mistake of basing the fundamental pieces of my existence on my marriage and my partner. I found I was content as long as love was present in my life. That nothing else mattered; such as money, status, material objects, vacations, houses, etc as long as I had my wife. The betrayal stings like nothing has ever stung before. Although my fault, I have been almost completely robbed on my independence. When I say that, I refer to my living situation. I was living near, but away from family for the last 8.5 years and enjoying every moment of my 'freedom'. Now I live with my brother & grandmother, and nothing feels quite right anymore. I'm stuck between this rock and hard place about seeking out another individual to build anything with. My trust has been used up, my life has been changed drastically, and I have lost the person who said for over 8 years that she didn't believe in divorce. This experience flat out sucks. And while I hold all of the power on how to feel about the situation itself, as well as myself, it's difficult to adapt to something I didn't want to willing cooperate with. Truthfully a dejected series of events being the one wanting to work through the problem while your partner does not."

Sadness for the loss of my partner, anger at them for leaving, and fear of being alone forever. I have a hard time even imagining a future for myself right now. I've been told that time heals all wounds, but it's hard to believe when you're in the middle of it all. I'm not even sure if I'm ready to open up to the possibility of a new relationship. It's like my heart is still in the process of healing. I'm just trying to take it one day at a time and see where this journey takes me. I'm just a lost soul trying to find my way back to happiness."
