        "Summarize the following story in first person: I couldn't believe how worried I was! After all the work and all the money and all the preparation that took place, I didn't think I'd be able to get my citizenship three months ago. The whole event is still fresh in my mind as though it happened yesterday! I was surprised at how disorganized the entire event was considering the solemnity of it all. I really thought my new home country would be more organized than my birth country. Everything did settle down and we got down to business fairly quickly once the judge came out. She looked quite regal in her black robes, but she was quite stern. I could tell she was no-nonsense since when she entered the room, everyone scrambled to get things right. When the swearing in began, I couldn't believe how quickly the previous disorganization around me faded into the background. With just a few words, I was now a brand new United States citizen! The one thing that brought me into the present as I raised my hand to take the oath was how my new American friends cried tears of joy when I spoke the words pledging my allegiance to the U.S. I knew they cared, but I didn't know how happy they were for me until that moment. Getting my citizenship was the best day of my life. All the effort was more than worth it when I left the courthouse with my brand new citizenship. I never had to worry about not being protected from deportation ever again. I'm going to love my new life!"
