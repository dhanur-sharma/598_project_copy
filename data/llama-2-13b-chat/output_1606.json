        "Summarize the following story in first person: We had an awesome cookout for the kids and their friends. Their friends' parents were able to join in as well if they wanted to. The day came and we set everything up in the yard such as the tents, tables, chairs, and grill. A few people started to arrive  and all of a sudden it became cloudy. Throughout the entire week, there wasn't anything in the forecast to say that it would rain. As the last person arrived, the rain began and it came down hard. All the kids were gathered inside the house so they wouldn't get wet under the tents and the adults lounged outside underneath the over hang of the house. It was chaotic and we didn't have a lot of room for the amount of people that were in the house, but somehow we made it work. The kids played games on the floor, talked to each other, played game systems and even took pictures every so often with their phone. They all had a blast despite the weather change. The adults had a good time just to mingle around and talk. The food was good to eat and everyone had a full belly. A few hours later, it was time for everyone to go home. The parents who did not stay, came to pick up their kids, some of the parents that came to eat helped put up the tables and chairs and cleaned up a bit. My kids had a great time to see their friends over the summer with this cookout."
