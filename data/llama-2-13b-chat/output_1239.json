        "Summarize the following story in first person: Dear diary,Today Jimmy asked me if he could walk me to class and then we held hands all the way to class. That was more of an ice breaker because I only know of diaries from Nickelodeon as a kid, but now that the hard part is over. I am going to chronicle the evening when I lost touch with realistic (more of less). As I recall, I had been awake for approximately 48 hours or so, maybe closer to seventy two now that I know about it. In either event, I was hacking away at my desktop as I always do, and I heard some noises coming from my front yard that sounded more than the standard neighborhood kid tomfoolery. It was just some kids in the front yard, I figured maybe they were going to try ding dong ditch or maybe just some hand ball. Keep in mind it was still mid afternoon at this point, so it did not seem out of the ordinary. Fast forward to about 19:00-20:00 and I hear that same noise going on again. So I wonder over to window and I see a small child near my truck. Now, bear in mind I can't be certain that what I remember is real. Perhaps it was the culmination of too many episodes of the X-Files and lasting psychological affects from my sleeping issues, but I digress. So I see a child near my truck and shrug it off as kids being kids. Then I hear the noise again, but amplified and as I approach the window, I see my levitating three to four feet in the air. I immediately dash out to my front yard, but I can see that my truck is untouched and on the ground as if nothing happened. This goes on about five or six more times of me settling back into my work and then hearing a noise, only to see my truck once again three to four feet in the air. By now, I am convince they must have placed some sort of device to reverse the magnetic polarity between the truck and the ground (batshit crazy, I know). Luckily my room mate came home not too long afterwards and stopped to ask me why I was running around the neighborhood looking for these children with this device.  Long story short, he cold cocked me and wrestled me back into the house. The rest of the night is a bit of a blur, but the last thing I remember is seeing him on the front porch talking to group of kids that I had been after. He and I never spoke about it. Ever since that night, I have gained a new appreciation for the power of the mind. I normally consider myself very objective and logical, and am quite fascinated by the possibility that I could believe such an implausible story in the face of what I know to be true."
