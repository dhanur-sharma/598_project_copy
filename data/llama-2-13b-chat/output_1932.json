        "Summarize the following story in first person: In August I went to go visit the Yellowstone National Park. I went on a walking tour and say many of the park's geysers and also many wild animals. I also went fly fishing for the first time in my life and caught some fish while there. My vacation was very memorable and I had several experiences that I will carry with me for a long time.  I went with two other of my friends from my university and we camped in tents at a nice campground while we were there. The most memorable moment of the trip was whenever I caught my first fish while fly fishing. I didn't expect to catch anything because I didn't think I was doing it right and I haven't had much luck in my past with regular fishing. To my surprise, on my fifth cast, the line was pulled hard and I quickly jerked back and reeled in a 4 lb trout! Since I've been so busy with college over the past many years, it's been a long time since I've had the chance to take a vacation and enjoy nature. My major in school is environmental science and I always thought it was silly that I was studying the environment but hadn't actually been in a natural environment in 10+ years. This was a much needed vacation. My friends and I cooked our fish that we caught for supper every night over a campfire. In the mornings we would tour the park in search of rare geysers that were about to go off. Those were fun to watch but I enjoyed seeing the beautiful multi-colored pools of hot water that scattered the landscape. It was also very neat to learn about the ancient people that used to live in the area and their religious significance that they placed on the land. I enjoyed writing this journal entry and would like to participate in the second part of the study as well."
