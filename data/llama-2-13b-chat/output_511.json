        "Summarize the following story in first person: This past month I moved into a place with my girlfriend which is the first time I've ever moved in with any significant other. Needless to say, this was a very memorable event for me. Since I was a child I had envisioned settling down with someone and this has started to make it feel like a reality. It's a very warm and nice feeling to have your own place with someone you love. It took us about a week to find something nice and affordable in our area, so we bounced around hotels for that time and treated it like a bit of a vacation and a getting used to living with each other experience. We found a place we liked though and moved the very next day. It was a bit of a leap from how things used to be, but I'm glad I took the leap. It was definitely time in my life to try this out as I'm already 25 now. Heck, most of my friends are getting married now so I feel almost like an oddball. It's ok though because I'm happier going at my own pace. I'd say this has been a good choice though. I believe it will only bring my partner and I closer than we ever have been before. We're like our own team and can stand up to any of lifes challenges. It's nice to be part of something like that. I must say, it's definitely everything I had imagined it would be when I was little."
