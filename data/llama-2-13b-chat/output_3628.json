        "Summarize the following story in first person: Recently, my 2 daughters and I went camping for a weekend with my dad. We swam in a river, barbecued, went fishing. It was a fun and bonding weekend with my kids and their grandfather. My dad is a little absent minded. He had forgot the key to the gate one night at the cabin. He had to get a lantern and go up in the dark into the campground to get the key. While my daughters and I waited in the dark outside the gate. I told my kids ghost stories while he was gone. We got a good thrill! We also had a flat tire during the trip. Had to spend some time dealing with that. My dad put a screw into the tire to plug up the hole temporarily. So we could drive into town. This was good that he was able to fix it that way, because I did not have a spare, just a fix a flat inflator. And the area was so isolated, we had no signal to call for help.  A couple of my cousins came up no Sunday afternoon and went swimming with us. I had not seen them in years, so it was fun to spend time with them. We drank beers and got a little tipsy and told my girls some funny stories from when we were kids. The coolest thing that happened, was we were catching fish and putting them on a rope to leave in the water. We left those fish there for a while as we ate dinner at the cabin. By the time we went back to get our fish, a huge water snake had come and swallowed one of the fish whole. The snake killed itself. It was very long, about 3-4 feet. We got a lot of cool pictures and a lot of attention from all the other fisherman in the area. Overall, it was a fun and adventurous weekend that my kids will never forget."
