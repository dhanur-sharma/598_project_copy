        "Summarize the following story in first person: I had a very sad experience with loss of life recently. When I was a child, about 10 years ago, my family got a dog. It was a beautiful beagle dalmation mix. We played together all the time. We would go to the park and run chasing each other. A few years ago she got sick with heart worms. We took her to the vet and she was prescribed a medication that fixed the issue. That's what caused what happened 10 weeks ago to be surprising. When she had another health issue, I expected it to be treatable. We took her to the vet who took a blood sample. He also took a biopsy. The results came back as cancer. He said we could try treating her. I knew that cancer was going to  cause a decline in her health. But I didn't expect the medication itself to cause an allergic reaction in her. During the first dosage, she went into cardiac arrest and we abruptly had to put her down."
