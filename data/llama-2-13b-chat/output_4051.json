        "Summarize the following story in first person: At the end of October I took a trip out to New York City, where I'm originally from. Many of my friends from high school are still living there and I made plans to get together for a Yankees game with some of them. The evening we choose to see the game was a beautiful night. The temperature was unseasonable hot so nobody has to wear a jacket. There was also not a cloud in the sky so the views of Yankee Stadium were just amazing! It had been such a long time since I had the chance to be there that I had forgotten how truly stunning Yankee Stadium is on its own. Since we got there early we decided to get some delicious ball park franks along with nachos! No matter how our tastes change over the years one thing that never can be topped is Yankee Stadium's food. Just smelling it brought back memories of visiting the old Yankee Stadium with my family. Most of us went ahead and got some beers with the food. Although some of us with more sensitive stomachs decided to opt for soda instead. We took all of our snacks up to the bleachers and found our seats. Hanging out together as some music was playing and people were slowly filling in the stands was an amazing aspect of the evening. It just made everything seem so much fun and we all found each other's company so relaxing. Finally as the stadium filled up the Boston Red Sox team were introduced as the visitors, to many boos from the audience. We all settled in to watch the Yankees win. Much to our dismay the Yankees ended up losing the game. None of us were very happy with the outcome of the game but we all did end up enjoying the evening together very much and hope to be able to repeat it soon. Looking back I really do feel like the highlight was just spending time with old friends and reconnecting with them."
