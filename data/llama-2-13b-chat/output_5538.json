My son put a 100 dollar deposit on her. As we are driving 300 miles away to get the new puppy, our car breaks down. We are now unable to make it to the place to get the new puppy. My son lost his 100 dollar deposit. So we decide to let go the idea of a new puppy. we were looking online  to find a new puppy. We weren't really sure we would find another one. When a few weeks later we see that someone is selling a puppy that was the same kind as the one we were going to get. This puppy was also 100 dollars cheaper. Also the new puppy is only 6 miles away. So last week we got a new puppy!"
