        "Summarize the following story in first person: Thinking about my brother a lot today as I start my first year of high school. Today my big brother would be starting his senior year or high school and I my freshman year. Earlier this year he was involved in a car accident after his junior prom. Why do people drink and drive? I should be getting my drivers permit pretty soon but my parents aren't exactly thrilled for me to be driving soon. I can understand, it has been a traumatizing experience for me as well. But I know they could use the help with running errands and taking my little sister to school. My brother was always so helpful, he was like superman. Captain of the basketball team, on the honor roll, popular and still made time to help us with homework and getting where we needed to be when mom and dad were working long hours. Ever since he died things have been quiet at home. We try not to being him up much and when we do, we smile and then immediately get saddened that we can't hear just one more joke. He and a few friends had been involved in an accident with a drunk driver who is now in prison, this wasn't his first DUI but we are praying it is his last. I hope they put him away for a long time. My brother's life wasn't the only one that was lost that night. Two other individuals from his basketball team were in the car with him, twins to a single mom who lives just down the street. I see her from time to time when I ride my bike around the neighborhood. She looks sad, lonely. I know just the feeling. My brother was the only one who didn't make me feel invisible. I miss him so much and hope I make him proud throughout these next few years in high school."
