        "Summarize the following story in first person: My brother and four year old niece came over to visit last week, and it was the first time I saw them in almost a year. My niece had grown so much since then, and was running around, talking up a storm, and asking for someone to play dolls with her. She came dressed in a Frozen 2 princess dress and sneakers, and looked like she was ready for action. She had just gotten some Barbie dolls for her birthday and, as an only child, had no one to play with, so I volunteered. It was incredible to see how smart she was, and how she could figure things out on her own. I hadn't seen her since last Christmas, and with so many family members around, it's a little hard to be with anyone individually. I remember her as a shy little girl who really wanted nothing to do with me, so seeing her break out of her shell this time was such a revelation and joy for me. I was incredibly impressed at how she bounced around from one activity to another, and I had trouble keeping up with her! I only made things worse by giving her a small piece of candy - one little Reese's peanut butter candy and she was hyper! Eventually, my brother showed me a way to calm her down... by letting her watch some videos on YouTube that I had no concept of, but entertained her to no end. She asked to take her shoes and socks off - so polite - and proceeded to spend the rest of her time here as a barefoot little angel. After that, we did some coloring, and played with her dolls some more. It was all too soon that her dad was telling her it was time to go home, but she didn't want to! She said she wanted to stay there and play with me... something that touched me so dearly! I was so appreciative that I was able to have such an effect on her! We promised she could visit again soon, and they left, also wishing she could stay a little longer. I was glad I was able to bond with my niece for the first time."
