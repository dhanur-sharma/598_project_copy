I had even come with a set budget, so I couldn't believe what ended up happening. I won a good jackpot! I was so excited, too. I whooped and shouted, which is embarrassing to think back on. I ended up buying the bar goers their drinks, which I feel pretty great about. It was an expensive tab, however, but they seemed to be grateful. It was just expensive. I ended up going out to eat afterwards with my friends. That was also expensive. Thankfully, it was a good jackpot. I have some leftover, thankfully. I intend to invest the rest of my winnings toward smarter ventures. I'm ashamed at how this was one of my most memorable recent events, actually. It just serves to push me to do more things outside the box."
