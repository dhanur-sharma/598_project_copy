        "Summarize the following story in first person: A memorable event that occurred in the past 3 months was preparing my eldest child for kindergarten. I worked really hard over the summer helping her set a schedule and routine that would be similar to her school day. She worked on many activities in order to memorize her contact information, writing, reading, and being able to handle her emotional well-being. As summer began to end, she seemed a little nervous to leave me and her little sister. I realized that I there was no way to remove that feeling from her. Instead, I made plans for us to do activities when she finishes her school day. Planning ahead allows for her to feel like her school day really isn't too long. When school first began, she was very tired from the long day. I didn't realize how much her schedule had affected her, so I introduced \"cuddle time\", which is pretty fun for her. The most important aspects of my child starting school have been numerous. I learned how important my role as mom is for my kids. I am their literal compass, and that responsibility goes beyond just sending them off to school. I try to understand how her day is going, and what obstacles she faces each day. I meditate on how I can be influential in her education when she gets home from school. I love this new journey that we are on, and am actively preparing myself for the next several years of her school career."
