        "Summarize the following story in first person: I believe life is precious. You can only live one life, unfortunately. Death, can sweep you away in an instant. Some people just let it happen, but others are just too stubborn to give up. I have a person in my life that has experienced this, along with myself. I experienced a traumatic experience. My mother was driving my friend, me, and my brothers to my dad\u2019s house. My youngest brother, my friend, and I, were in the backseat and my eldest brother was in the passenger seat. My friend, my brother, and I were joking around and laughing in the backseat, when all of a sudden, the world went black. I opened my eyes moments later only to see my mother crying helplessly and weakly for help. I looked to my left, where my friend was, she was calling for her mother, saying \u201cI want my mom, where is my mom?\u201d and complaining that her shoulder hurt. I then looked to my right, and saw my little brother crying, and breathing harshly and saying \u201cMom wake up, Mom!!!\u201d I, felt like crying but could not, I had to keep my brother and my friend, who are both two years younger than me, calm. My eldest brother, surprisingly was fine. He asked me if I was alright, and I responded by saying, my head hurts. My brother suddenly looked at the side of my face, and said \u201cJade put your gloves on your face.\u201d I was wondering why so of course I did it but not that much of hurt i got. My brother was so scared and cried for our life . At that time a horse came there and jump over our car and surprised me because of this behave."

She was shaking a lot, and my brothers and I were trying to keep her calm. I felt like I was in a movie or something, everything was so surreal. The sound of the horse hooves on the ground and the car engine were the only sounds I could hear. My friend was still calling for her mom, and my little brother was still crying. I was scared, but I had to keep it together for my brothers and my friend. I don\u2019t know how I did it, but I managed to keep my composure. I was so scared that I was going to lose my mother. I thought that was the end of our lives. I never thought that I would be able to write this down, but here I am, writing about this traumatic experience. Life is precious, and we should never take it for granted.\n\n"
