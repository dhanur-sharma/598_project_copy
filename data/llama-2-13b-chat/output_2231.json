        "Summarize the following story in first person: This happened a couple month ago where we had a gaming tournament. This gaming tournament is 7 weeks long and we play twice per week. So, this totals in 14 games for the season. Before every game that we played, we would practice with other teams. This is called scrimmages and we would do as much as we can do get the feel of the game. All in all, me and friends would play at least 5 scrimmages per day to get the practice in. In these scrimmages there are ups and downs. Sometimes we won't like to play any scrimmages at all because we be burnt out. Sometimes we will not be in the same page as a team and we would just get frustrated from each other. The lesson that we learned from this is that, we need to rest sometimes and not just play all the time. So, our plan changed every week to practice. Long story short, we ended up winning twelve out of the fourteen games of the season. This means that we were in the playoffs after a long season. The playoffs will start 3 weeks after the season ended, which is bad for us in my opinion. It was bad for us because we got comfortable and we would stop practicing because we think that we were better than our opponents for the playoffs. Long story short we lost this playoff game and were out of the tournament. I was disappointed because we put a lot of time in this game and we would just get kicked out of the tournament in the first day of playoffs."
