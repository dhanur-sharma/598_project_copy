        "Summarize the following story in first person: Dear Diary, It's me again. I wanted to fill you in on my birthday 4 weeks ago. It was the time of my life. I have been so busy with work and school I barely noticed my birthday coming up, until my girlfriend asked what I wanted to do. I told her I've been exhausted and really wanted to do nothing. The morning of my birthday I was told to pack a bag and hop in the car. My girlfriend planned a little road trip for my birthday and said all I had to do is nothing like I requested. We arrived at a cabin as I open the door there were a few of my close friends and the cabin was very nice. It had all the things you could need to relax. The hot tub was something I still miss. This was a memorable weekend. We laughed, played games, relaxed, even cooked and party a bit. This getaway is what I needed. I did not see this coming and truly planned on doing nothing. I'm glad my girlfriend found a way to balance it. I am already thinking of plans for her birthday next."
