        "Summarize the following story in first person: Over the summer, my girlfriend and I went to the beach. It was where we had met a few summers ago and became friends. We had given each other our email addresses thinking that we'd keep in contact and we did. We later went to college and picked the same one and started dating after that. So going to the beach was one of the more special times we got to have together. I knew that this time, I was going to  propose to her. I had the ring and kept it in my bag the whole way to the beach. We had so much fun in the car singing and reflecting on our time together. The set up was perfect! We kept tossing memories back and forth to each other until we got to the beach. We found our hotel and got a room that had a perfect view of the ocean. She thought it was the most beautiful scene she had ever seen. I felt like the timing for all of this was perfect! That night, we went to dinner and then went for a walk on the beach. You know when you get the feeling that everything is just perfect? That was that night. People were shooting off fireworks in the distance and the cool air was perfect. As soon as we got to the pier we used to sit and talk at, I got down on one knee. She started shaking and crying. I told her I loved her and only her and that she would make me so happy if she would be my wife. She agreed and hugged me. She loved the ring and the night was perfect! A few people that were on the beach had saw everything and brought over some wine for us to enjoy!"
