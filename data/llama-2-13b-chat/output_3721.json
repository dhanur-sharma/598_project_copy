        "Summarize the following story in first person: 3 months ago I went to the funnest birthday party of my life. It was for my baby nephew's first birthday, and it was my first time getting to meet him. I moved away from my family a few years ago, so when my brother had his first child, I was so very proud of him, but so sad that I couldn't be there. I've been traveling around like crazy for my business, and I just hadn't been able to catch my breath to go visit my family in such a long time. But, when my brother told me that he was throwing a party for his son, I knew the excuses had to stop. No matter what it cost me, I was going to be there. So I cancelled everything. Every meeting, every sale, no matter what it was, it was cancelled. I bought my plane ticket and I was on my way. When I arrived the party had already started. My entire family was there. Even family I hadn't seen since I was a little kid. I almost cried. Then when I saw my nephew, my brother brought him over to me and told my nephew that I was his uncle. I felt so proud. I held my nephew in my arms for the first time and realized that this was the greatest day of my life. Electricity shot through my body. I knew I wanted a child of my own that day. After that, we ate cake and pizza, we say around the fire, and we just enjoyed life. It was beautiful."
