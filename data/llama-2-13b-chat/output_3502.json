        "Summarize the following story in first person: 4 months ago my dad was put in assisted living facility. He had been dealing with Parkinson's and not doing to hot. On top of that, he has other chronic mental issues. This is taking a huge toll on my family. He is dying alone while everyone else goes on with their day. This does not feel good to me and I can't do much about it being miles and miles away. I can only see him so much and no one else is doing their part. This hurts really bad. My brother and him were really close, but when push comes to shove, he is lacking the skills to see him. My dad can't really do much on his own. His mind is going and needs people he knows to be around him. The thought that I will get that call soon hurts really bad. The thought of my dad being alone scares me and hurts me. I wish I could pick up and move closer, but I have my life here. This is sad and hurts me and affects my family. I wish there would be people in there that would visit him and make him more comfortable. This really sucks. Please help and think about my father."
