        "Summarize the following story in first person: Today was a very good Sunday.  I was invited to lead the music at a joint church service at a church I've never been to before.  A church in a city a bit far off, they asked if I could lead their music.  I was floored by the invitation.  The pastor of that asked for me specifically.  He had visited my church a couple of times before and saw how we run our music for our liturgy.  As the leader of my church's music, I only expected to only lead music for my church.  I never really had no thoughts of leading other churches in the near future.  Then a couple weeks before this day, my pastor told me that the pastor of another church we will be joining services with asked me to lead their music for our joint service.  I was initially in shock, but jumped at the chance to serve where I was able to do. After I finished leading music at the church, I felt great and more sure of my abilities.  The church members were very thankful for my services and enjoyed the all a'cappella approach I institute at my own church.  They told me how they enjoyed just hearing voices to sing hymns and how much more participation the congregation there was than before.  I am very grateful for the opportunity I was given and how blessed myself and others were in the service I was able to give.  I hope I get opportunities like this again, but to remember that it is all for the glory of God and not myself."
