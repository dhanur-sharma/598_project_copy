        "Summarize the following story in first person: My father and I did not always have the closest relationship. He was in and out of my life. But as I get older I realized I only had one father and needed to mend our relationship and the time apart. My father is not getting any younger. His health is worsening and I have found out that they do not know how long he has. I went to see him and told him going forward I wanted us to make up for lost time. I wanted him to spend time with his grandchildren. I wanted him to know the past was the past  and that when he is gone I want it to be knowing I loved him for who he was, not for the time he was or was not around. I think he appreciated that. He said  he did not deserve my forgiveness because of me being gone for so long. That was three months ago and I am forever grateful for the time we have had. Reconnecting and re bonding has been great for both of us. Not getting to say good bye is very hard. It eats at you. You wish you could have said so much more.  Losing a parent is devastating"
