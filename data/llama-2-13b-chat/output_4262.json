        "Summarize the following story in first person: About four or five months ago, I was travelling around Indonesia with my wife, and I went jogging by myself late at night. I like to jog and explore on my own, especially when I'm in another country. Anyway, I was jogging, and I was high on some marijuana that I was able to purchase through Indonesian friends. After a while, I became tired and started walking. I was sweaty, high, and feeling great. All of a sudden, I walk past a group of people, and one of the guys in the group calls out to me and asks, \"Girls?\" I knew what he meant, but I wanted to make sure, so I pretended to be confused. He then asked me if I wanted girls. I told him that I'm married. He laughed and said, \"It's okay. You want girls, very beautiful. Thirteen years old, fourteen years old.\" I said, \"NO! NO WAY! Thank you. My wife is waiting for me.\" I walked for a while, and when I got back to the place I was staying at, I told my wife what happened. There is a lot of shady stuff that goes on in this world."
