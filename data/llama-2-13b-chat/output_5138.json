        "Summarize the following story in first person: A couple months ago, I was involved in an incident where I found out that my boyfriend was cheating on me. I was out to dinner with him at a relatively nice restaurant, and I noticed that he would not stop checking his phone. I had noticed that he had done this occasionally in the weeks preceding this event, but it had not been to this extent. I immediately became suspicious. I had been cheated on in past relationships, and I knew the warning signs. I have a hard time executing confrontations, but I decided that enough was enough and I should definitely say something to him. I asked him why he was being so weird lately, and he immediately became defensive. I knew that this was not going to end well, and I did not want to cause a scene in public. So, I said never mind and we ate the rest of our meal in silence. When we left the restaurant and began driving home, he told me that he was going to drop me off at my house. I was fully expecting to come over to his house and sleep over as we usually did, but he obviously did not have the same idea as me. I asked him why and he told me that he wasn't feeling well and just wanted to go lay down. Every part of me wanted to start an argument then and there but I stopped myself, and just remained quiet while he dropped me off. I kissed him and said by like usual, but as soon as he pulled out of my driveway and left, I got in my car and proceeded to follow him. I tried to remain as discrete as possible, and I wound up following him to a house that wasn't his. I was him go inside, and I immediately knew that something was wrong. I got out of my car, knocked on the door, and when a woman answered the door, I immediately turned around got back in my car and went home. I was completely devastated."

The next day I decided to confront him and ask him to explain what was going on. He denied everything, and told me that I was being paranoid and overreacting. I knew that he was lying, but I didn't know what to do. I decided to give him the benefit of the doubt and see if he would eventually come clean. It didn't take long for him to continue cheating and eventually break up with me. I was heartbroken, but I knew that I had to move on. I am still trying to heal from the experience, but I am grateful that I found out when I did and not after investing more time and emotions into the relationship.\n\n"
