        "Summarize the following story in first person: I recently went to my best friend's wedding in Spain. This was about 4 months ago, and was in the south of Spain, a part of Spain I had never been to before. Before the trip, I was extremely busy and had very limited time to actually plan the trip. Therefore, I had fairly low expectations about it and didn't think too much about it until it actually happened. I had been fairly often to Spain before (mostly the North), and therefore thought that the South was very similar to it culturally. However, once I arrived to Ubeda, the little village where my friend's wedding was taking place, I realized I had been all wrong. The streets were narrow, the town was full of culture and beautiful monuments due to the its rich history and culture, and I couldn't believe my eyes. The trip made a strong impression on me and made me fall in love with the town. People were friendly, the food was delicious. Over there, people have jamon, with bread, tomatoes, and olive oil at breakfast. Initially, it seemed strange to me but by the third day, it seemed so natural to me and I feel like I had lived there my whole life. My best friend's family was warm and lovely as well. I realized quickly that it was a defining personality trait of people from the south of Spain. Toward the end of my week-long trip, I began dreading my departure from the city, and tried to take as many mental pictures of the trip as I could so I would never forget it. Specifically, the wedding cathedral, the endless olive oil fields, the jamon available at every restaurant in town, the beautiful weather and the friendliness of the people. Since I have been back, I have already begun planning my trip back, as well as learning Spanish, and this trip had a strong unexpected impact on my life."
