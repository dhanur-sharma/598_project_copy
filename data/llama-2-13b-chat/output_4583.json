        "Summarize the following story in first person: My most memorable event was having the 90th anniversary of baseball's All-Star Game in my hometown. It was the most electrifying and captivating moments of the year. On the day of the game, I was trying to participate in an event that was hosted by my city. I wanted to meet one of the players on the American league's team. Yet, it can be very difficult to navigate in this section of the city. Also, it is safer and more enjoyable to experience this moment with someone else. Thus, I asked my mom to attend this event with me. Unfortunately, she was not feeling well and we could not attend.  Although I was really disappointed, I continued to look at the site to see the price for discounted tickets for the event. In the corner of my computer screen, I saw an ad for memorabilia. Initially, I was cautious but I wanted to click on it to see where it would lead. When I clicked on the ad, I was taken to the website for Major League Baseball. They were promoting free shipping on all-star game memorabilia. Since I know some baseball fanatics, I knew it would be nice to purchase one of those items. Therefore, I picked out a nice gift and sent it to one of my relatives who is a baseball fan. Weeks later, my relative was so excited to show me the memorabilia."
