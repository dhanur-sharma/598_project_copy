        "Summarize the following story in first person: Three months ago I reached a milestone in my life. I got to see my daughter go off to kindergarten. Now, I know how my mother felt when she released me into the world. You are excited but extremely anxious. The only thought I always have \"I am not there to protect her.\" I know that I should not worry about that type of stuff but I do. It's an odd feeling when you have lived through kindergarten and then lived through your child going to kindergarten. I often feel more like my mother than I realized. Anyways, she was excited to go this morning and I only cried a few tears. When we arrived I walked her to the classroom and before she ran off to play with her friends she gave me a big hug. I'm glad she did not forget about me but I am also thrilled she's ready to take on life. I told the teacher good morning and walked to the door to leave but not before I could get one last glimpse of my girl. Our eyes met and she smiled. I blew her a kiss and went straight to the car to cry. I never believed my parents when they told me \"just wait until it's your child.\" Well now I am here and I totally understand. Thanks Mom and Dad."
