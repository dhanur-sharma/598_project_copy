        "Summarize the following story in first person: Right around the time that I started seeing my girlfriend two years ago, her mother passed away.  I had never met the woman, but I've so many stories that I feel like I did.  This past July, her family and I flew out to the Big Island in Hawaii to spread the ashes.  The day came to spread the ashes and we made the picturesque drive across the Island to the Hawaii Tropical Botanical Garden.  I have never seen such breathtaking sights in my entire life: lush, verdant, practically alien-to-me plants everywhere; the most colorful flowers you can imagine; awe-inspiring waterfalls; and a medley of countless exotic birds all singing their enchanting island songs.  Once we arrived to the gardens and began the descent down the trail, it was even more sublime than the drive.  I truly felt like I was transported to another reality in which nothing existed but this sprawling, magical rain forest.  I was nervous that the day was going to be difficult for my girlfriend, her sister and all their children, but I approached it with a level of confidence in my abilities to comfort that I didn't even know existed.  We gathered at a stopping point and everyone said words that celebrated the life that had been lost.  The plan for everyone to find spots in the gardens that spoke to them and spread portions of the ashes.  The remains were divvied up and we resumed our journey downward. The atmosphere grew quiet and the birds almost seemed to sense this:  their songs had quieted into barely audible chirps.  Everyone's faces had a mixture of sorrow and happiness and I just maintained a stoic, yet positive look throughout.  The silence was interrupted by my girlfriend's oldest daughter who shrieked as she sprinkled some of the ashes, \"Ewwwww bones!\"  My stomach sank for a moment, but everyone else chuckled a little bit and we moved on. The group slowly began to separate a little bit and my girlfriend led me down a path as she clutched my hand.  \"Find a place that you'd like to spread some,\" she said.  I panicked for a moment and said, \"I don't think that's appropri---.\"  She cut me off with a firm shush.  \"She would have loved you.  Please do this for me,\" my girlfriend said as tears were welling up in her eyes.  I quickly, albeit a bit reluctantly, agreed. A few moments later we came to a majestic, spindly tree reaching higher than all the others around it.  A solitary bright beam of sunlight was gleaming through the canopy above and had illuminated an orchid.  The orchid was a beautiful mixture of purple fading into pink with little flecks of periwinkle on all the petals and it was swaying ever-so-slightly from a breeze; I knew this was the place. As I sprinkled the ash just underneath the orchid onto the moss-covered ground, the birds stopped singing entirely and I was enraptured by a tender, touching silence like I had never experienced in my life."

We stood there for a few moments and I felt a deep sense of connection to her and the memory of her mother that I had never felt before.  This experience will be forever etched into my memory.  We all met back up and the rest of the day was filled with laughter, storytelling and more tears, but it was all so worth it.  I learned a lot about myself that day and how I can be strong and supportive in difficult times.  It was a truly special day and I will always cherish it."
