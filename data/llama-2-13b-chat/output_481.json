        "Summarize the following story in first person: The morning of giving birth, I was admitted into the hospital where I had to fill out paper work, all the \"good stuff.\" My anxiety wasn't as bad, I was ready for my baby to be born. After I signed the papers, and was taken to the room where I was going to have my baby, I was given a gown. They administered an IV and gave me medicine to speed up my labor. About an hour later, the doctor came in and broke my water. Afterwards, they told me to just get comfortable and try to rest, that it was a waiting game. My contractions were getting a little more intense, but nothing I couldn't handle. I decided to watch a little TV. I couldn't go to sleep, I was too anxious. Nurses were coming in to check my monitor, IV, and to see how far I was dilated. I can't remember exactly what time I got my epidural, but I decided to go ahead and get it before it was too late. I was at a 6 or 7cm at this point. The doctor who put the epidural in, had to take it out and redo it because I was still able to feel places I wasn't suppose to. After the second attempt, it was good to go. I was numb mainly on one side. As it would wear off, I was able to feel my contractions, so the nurses would come in and push the button for more. So far everything was good, the pain was manageable. I had family and friends come in and out. Around 7pm, my contractions were getting stronger, and my epidural was not working. The nurses would come in and check my cervix and see how far I was dilated. I was already feeling the urge to push, but they wouldn't let me. Around 8-8:30pm, the nurses came back in because I was in crucial pain. I was trying to jerk the IV out of my hand, took off the baby monitor because I didn't want anything on me or touching me. I was vomiting, and sweating up a storm. They then confirmed I could start pushing. An hour straight of pushing, my baby was finally born at 9:56pm!"
