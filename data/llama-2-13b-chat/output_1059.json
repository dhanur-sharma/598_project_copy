        "Summarize the following story in first person: I moved out to the country in Oklahoma about a year ago. It is sometimes hard for me to see the the animals that are killed on the side of the road or in the road. Is painful to drive past them. But on this day I got an opportunity to help. There was a tiny dog being chased by a large dog on the side of the road and I pulled over and chased the big dog away and scooped up the little dog. I remember the little dog shaking so hard and just being terrified and holding her close to me and feeling her breathing finally slowed just a bit and her shaking stopped just a little bit. She would definitely have been attacked if I had not scooped her up. I took her home with me and then the next day took her to the vet. She was not chipped. But I reached out on Facebook. And finally the owner contacted me. I was able to reunite her with her owners. It turns out that the people who were watching her thought that she had come in and locked up and left. But she was still outside. It was a joyous feeling to see her so happy reunited with her owners everyone was crying it was a great experience."
