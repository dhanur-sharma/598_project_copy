        "Summarize the following story in first person: Today was such an exciting day. I got a job! I am the new membership coordinator at a private country club. My days of serving are finally over and I can stop stressing about what\u2019s next finally. And even better, this is the job I\u2019ve always said that I wanted. Everything seems to be coming together for my move to Connecticut with Alejandro. It is happening way quicker than I thought, but I couldn\u2019t be more excited! I have been so upset lately thinking that I had no direction, but everything fell into place. Normally I stress out so much with interviews, but the last two have gone so well and I think that I have gotten better than I thought. Today\u2019s interview started off with a tour of the property. A long conversation with the General Manager followed and I knew that it was going well. I even met the current person in my position who I\u2019ll be training with and the Bookkeeper who seems very nice! Alejandro even surprised me after my interview! It meant so much to me! He had parked nearby and waited to surprise me for almost an hour. (The interview was almost 2 and a half hours, so he was waiting for a while). We grabbed some food at a diner nearby. The menu wasn\u2019t very big but I ordered a western omelette and a cup of coffee. I looked down at my phone after a few minutes and had a missed call. It was the General Manager of the Club. When I called back, I couldn\u2019t believe it. I got the job! They wanted me! I actually will be starting on Tuesday, which is way sooner than I thought. Even though it\u2019s bittersweet to say goodbye to my current job and my current apartment, I am so excited to begin this next adventure and am so proud of myself for achieving this goal!"
