        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last month, I went to a baby shower. It wasn't anyone I am really close to and they don't tend to run in the same circles as I do.  I was afraid that I would not enjoy myself because I didn't know everyone as much as I would like. I arrived a little early (as I usually do) and helped with any last minute set-up. The space was adorable, with lots of pink and bows everywhere. They really outdid themselves. I forgot to get the name of the caterer but the food was absolutely divine. They served so many kinds of finger foods and I probably stuffed myself with enough to feed a small army.  I ended up making a lot of small talk with everyone and it wasn't as terrifying as I thought going into it. I actually have a lot in common with a few of the other guests. So we exchanged numbers and hopefully we'll all be able to meet up sometime soon. It was a really fun event. The gifts she received were all cute and pink (as you could imagine) and we played a lot of fun games. I don't think I'll ever be afraid of going to a baby shower even again. I can't believe I thought about not going! What a great day."
