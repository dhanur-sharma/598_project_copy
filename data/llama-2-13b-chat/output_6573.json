        "Summarize the following story in first person: Three months ago I lost my beloved pet dog, Jesse. The day before Jesse passed away I wanted him to have his best day ever. We started the morning off by going on a long walk around the neighborhood. I let Jesse stop and sniff as many times as he wanted. When we got back home I gave him his favorite dry kibble topped with eggs and bacon I had prepared. We then hopped in my Jeep and headed to the ocean, one of Jesse's favorite spots. I threw his ball into the water over and over again until he got tired and we both rested on the cool sand. We then walked side by side along the ocean, taking in the cool breeze and salty air. After that we got back in my Jeep and drove to a local dog bakery where I bought him his all time favorite carob and peanut butter bone shaped cookie. He gobbled it down as I sat on the bench smiling at him. A woman and her child came by and asked if they could pet him. I said \"of course\" because Jesse loved people and any attention he got from them. The little girl rubbed his ears and gave him a kiss. We decided to head home and lay on the couch together and took a nap. That night I gave him his favorite wet dog food and we snuggled in my bed together. The next morning I woke up and Jesse had his eyes closed but was not breathing. I knew he was getting old, but I still felt like I had at least six more months with him. I will never forget my best friend Jesse and all the happiness he brought me."
