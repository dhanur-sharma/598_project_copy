        "Summarize the following story in first person: For the day of the cookout, we got everything together and set up. That included the tables, chairs, tents, food and were just waiting on the kids friends to arrive. They arrived right on time and I prepared for the appetizers to go outside on the table as my husband prepared the grill for the hotdogs and hambugers. One of my kid's friend's dad sat with my  husband and said that it was raining on the way to our house, however it wasn't doing anything yet. I did notice clouds were forming quickly and just like that it rained just after most of the guests arrive. I joked with him and told him that he jinxed us because all week long it was sunny and hot out. We had to usher all the kids into the living room which was not really big and the adults hung around outside underneath the eave of the house to stay dry a bit and to mingle. The kids played board games or took refuge in a separate room to play on the game system. After the food was cooked on the grill, I told the kids to come on and eat, which they all did. The adults came to grab some food on the second round that was finished and either sat at the kitchen table or went back outside. Finally, the rain did subside for the rest of the time and the kids went outside a bit after I dried the chairs so they could sit. Everyone had enjoyed their time even when it was almost rained out. Some of the kids friends came later before the cookout ended, but still enjoyed the time they spend with everyone. Two of the families stayed a little after to help out with the clean up a bit. They didn't feel right to leave us with so much to do which was very considerate of them. We laughed and talked a little bit more until it stated to get dark and they had to leave because of how far they drove. After eveyone had left, I was pretty happy with the turnout and that the house was quiet again. Even our dog had a great time and the kids were happy that they were able to see their friends before the new school year began. I hope that we are able to do this again for them. That day was a happy and great day."
