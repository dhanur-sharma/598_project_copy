        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was already two weeks overdue and I remember my back killing me because of how heavy my daughter was. Last year we just lost our grandmother because of her hitting her head on the floor. My grandma cared for me and my siblings when we were little. I was very young to remember but my parents used to tell me a lot of memories my grandma used to do when she was alive. The doctors said that my amniotic fluid was more than average. And I remember being too worried prior to my daughter's delivery. I had to get induced into pregnancy because it was taking too long. My husband and my siblings were there in the hospital with me. But I also felt that grandma was there with me making sure I was okay. During labor I was very pale and I feel like I was going to lose my daughter. It was excruciatingly painful but I wasn't concerned about me, I was concerned about my daughter's life. I was panicking but I felt my grandmother's presence in the operating room. It's almost as if she's whispering to me, \"I'm here, granddaughter. Take a deep breath and it will be okay.\" And it turned out to be okay. My daughter is now four years old and she's very intelligent and very curious about the modern world. She's way too young to be curious about the things going on around her that I am afraid she might grow up and learn about the evils in the world very early. But I can sense that you are guiding her and protecting her, grandma."
