        "Summarize the following story in first person: About three months ago, I got engaged to by my boyfriend of 5 years. I didn't see it coming and was totally caught off guard. He planned a trip for us to go to the beach. We hadn't been on a vacation in what seemed like forever and it was our one trip to finally get away. We geared up to head out and made our way to the west coast. Though I had never been, we always talked of getting there someday. We found our way to our hotel room and unpacked our stuff. After settling in, we decided it was time for the beach. At that point, it was sunset and he wanted to go out for a sunset walk along the water. So we did. It was surprisingly pretty empty on the beach. As we were walking, before I knew it, he bent down. At first I thought he had found something or had hurt himself somehow, but then he looked at me and pulled out the ring. I was ecstatic and overjoyed. I cried my eyes out. I will never forget that day and how much I love that man."
