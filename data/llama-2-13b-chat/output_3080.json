        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was two months ago when me and my friend set out to backpack around europe for about 3 weeks. We first landed in Ireland and it was the most amazing thing ever. We met many different people from around the world at our hostel. We got to explore Dublin and got to taste amazing food that the city had to offer.  After Ireland we took the ferry and headed towards London. We got see many historical landmarks and fully  took in the culture tasting food native to London. Then next city was Amsterdam. The art and culture that this city had to offer was breathtaking. The architecture was interesting and the bike culture pulled me in even more. We rode around the city and relaxed by the river side during the night.  Next stop was Switzerland. Once I got here I just didn't to leave at all. The natural landscape was absolutely breathtaking. My friends and I journey through this hiking trail that took us about 7 hours to complete but it was so worth it. We met alot of friendly people along the way and got to see the astonishing views that will forever be with us that we saw during the hike.  I will forever remember this trip that I took with my friends to experience different cultures and memories that was created along the way."
