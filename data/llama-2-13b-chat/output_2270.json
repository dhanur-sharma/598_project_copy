        "Summarize the following story in first person: On August 8 I celebrated my 26th birthday. This is a day that continues to be celebrated by individuals, and it seems I cannot get rid of this habit, either. I have come to love the day because it is personalized and individualistic. I am privileged to have  wonderful friends and family members, and on this day I was reminded exactly what I have. My dad, rarely at home, surprised me with a ticket to Paris. I have always wanted to travel to Paris, but I had not been able, and my dad made my dream come true. My mum gave a moving speech, my siblings shed tears of happiness, and my friends danced all night long. On top of that, my long-term partner proposed to me during the night. It was a surprise that was well hidden by everyone, and I was the only one who did not know. My partner proposed in front of my parents, and this was moving. And of course I said yes. He has always been a man of my dreams, and it was wonderful to get the surprise from him. This has to be the best birthday I have ever had. I got a chance to travel to my dream destination, listen to wonderful speeches by family members, and watch as family and friends were moved because of me. I really feel like there is no one lucky than me."
