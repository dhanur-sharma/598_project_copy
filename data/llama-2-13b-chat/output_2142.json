        "Summarize the following story in first person: I spent four weeks in Europe a few weeks ago touring Italy England. While I was in England, My companion and I decided to visit London to see all the sights.  We took the tour bus around the city and viewed many famous settings. I was very impressed by the design of the old and the new buildings I viewed while on the ride. We had a fantastic guide who not only gave history on all of the things pointed out, but he also suggested other places to go to see many more historic items. I was very impressed looking at Big Ben and the square surrounding the area. After seeing Big Ben in person, I could easily see why it was called Big Ben. We were fortunate enough to be in the open top portion of the tour bus so we had many unrestricted views. I really loved seeing all of the beauty of Buckingham Palace. It was not only large, but it fit so well with many of the other structures in the area. Sure looked like someone knew what they were doing when it was constructed. We decided it would be a great thing to do to go on the London Eye . We were not wrong as the view of the city from the top of the Eye was just spectacular. I could have stayed on the Eye for many, many hours. Another of the interesting things to see was the Tower Bridge. I found it very interesting to see the steam engines that were used to raise the bridge. The final stop on our time in England was our visit to Stonehenge in Avebury Plain. We toured the facility, visited the gift shop, the museum and completed our day viewing the Neolithic Village. The trip was fantastic and I would surely go back again."
