        "Summarize the following story in first person: Nine weeks ago, I got to witness first hand the dreams of my son coming true. For a long time, he had dreamed of opening up a Texas BBQ restaurant. I encouraged him to follow his dreams and finally his dreams came true. He opened up his own restaurant and has been very successful. I envisioned how it would look in my mind and was eager to see it, but my wife and i wanted to give him some time to get it just how he wanted before we went to visit. This was difficult, as I would have liked to go there on opening day. I was very proud of my son and would have liked to be there every step of the way but he is an adult and I wanted to give him the space he needed. After a couple months had past and the business was booming, my wife and I decided to take our first trip there. I was filled with excitement and anticipation as we pulled up to the establishment. It was a little before noon but the cars were starting to pile up fast to beat the lunch hour. I walked in and I was amazed at the look and layout. It looked like a true authentic Texas BBQ restaurant. My son came out from out back and greeted me with a big smile and a hug. I sat down and looked at the menu and was so hungry that I ordered just about everything off the menu. The food was amazing and the whole experience was amazing. I couldn't have been more proud of my son."
