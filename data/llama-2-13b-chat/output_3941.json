        "Summarize the following story in first person: it was about 3-4 months ago and when i was addicted to smoking weed. i was staying at a motel out of town that was close to my work at the time. i brought with me and couple bags of weed but knew it wasn't going to last long. with the bedbugs biting me every night while i stayed there i was feeling really anxious about my future and smoked all my stuff quickly. after i smoked it all i was still anxious the next few days and had no clue where to buy more from so i went door to door at the motel asking around. one person said they would sell me some and to wait in my room. After a couple hours of sitting on the floor to avoid the bedbugs i heard the door knock. I sprinted to the door like a marathon and low and behold the person was there with a baggie of something. i had no clue if it was legit or if it had something in it that was bad but i was anxious so i took it and payed for it. i paid the man the money and went to the table to open the baggie. it wasn't the usually stuff i was working with but it looked pretty normal to me. i packed my bowl and went to town on it. it relieved all my anxiety that very moment and i felt very relieved. Only problem was it was lasting only 5-10 minutes when my usual stuff would last hours. So i kept packing and packing my bowl with this weird substance of weed or as i look back now probably the legal K2 Stuff thats horrible for you and all night just kept packing it. halfway through the bag I noticed i started feeling very weird.. I took off my clothes and took a cold shower but that was no help. I started laying on the floor gasping for air trying to breath but couldn't grab enough oxygen. My girl took me to the hospital that day and it was just an 'anxiety attack' but i bought the stuff to help with the anxiety. how could it have made it worse. since then i have been dealing with severe anxiety."
