        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was picking my wife up at the hospital after a four day stay recovering from neuro surgery.  She is buttoned up in a Aspen Collar and in intense pain.  I was greatful that she had made it through surgery.  It was quite tricky fusing the upper three vertebrae of the spinal column.  She smiled through the pain very heroically.  She was glad to be going home but no one was happier than I was.  I was afraid of loosing her and concious of the long struggle we both had ahead during the looming recovery.  I knew I was going to be her main caretaker.  I would  have to run the house while she was in recovery.   I was not slightly intimidated by the prospect.  I drove home watching her wince at every bump in the road inher reaction to the pain.  I looked at the situation as another chance to excell.  We have been together for 45 years and I want our time to never end.  I called her family and informed them of her return home and asked them to call later to offer their support.  Love is a funny thing and sometimes you get blessings in forms you don't expect.  Thank you Lord."
