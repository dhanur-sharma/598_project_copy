        "Summarize the following story in first person: Today, my oldest son started kindergarten and his younger brother started pre-k.  They have different start times 5 minutes apart. The problem is that the schools are not 5 minutes away from each other; they are more like 15!  This is such a big day for both of them and I cannot wait to see them off to their first days of the rest of their lives. We are all very excited.  My wife and I had to come up with a plan to get each one to school on time, so they didn't feel out of place arriving late. Actually, we wanted them to arrive early to their classes.  So this was the plan. We would all wake up early in the morning and cook breakfast and have a family breakfast together.  It was decided that I would take the oldest son to his first day of kindergarten and see him off, and my wife would take the youngest to Pre-K. That way every one was on time and each child got the specialized attention they deserved. The plan was set, we explained to each of the boys what we were planning and they happily agreed. After breakfast, we each got to say our good byes to the boys and even the boys said goodbye to each other. It was rather emotional for everyone. We loaded our vehicles up and away we went.  As my oldest son and I arrived to the building, I could see the anticipation in his eyes.  He was very excited. As we entered the school, his excitement quickly turned to anxiety. He didn't want to go to the classroom.  I told him everything was going to be okay and I would see him after school.  I said \"Look at the friends you are going to make.\" After a few minutes, he calmed down and saw all the other children already playing with the toys.  Out of the window, he could see the playground.  He soon became fearless and very excited and went in to hang his backpack.  I stayed for a few short minutes so I could remember this day forever. It is and always will be a very special day in my heart."

I arrived just in time to see my youngest son happily playing with the other children.  He looked up and saw me and ran to the fence and gave me a big hug.  He was so happy to see me.  I was so happy to see him too.  After our hug, he went back to playing with the other children.  I watched him for a few minutes and then it was time to leave.  I said my goodbyes and headed back home.  "
