        "Summarize the following story in first person: A month ago I was supposed to be settling into a new home in a different city. I was set to begin as a student teacher at a school district, which is part of my credentialing program. I found a place I really liked. I was very excited to be starting out on a new adventure! However, my advisor, who is new, made a mistake. She neglected to tell me crucial information that I needed regarding placement deadlines. She was very unapologetic. Very proud and arrogant. I finally had to contact her boss since she was unwilling to admit she'd made a mistake. She would not answer my questions. She was condescending. It was so stressful, and I was honestly adrift for awhile. In the end, it turned out ok for me. I was able to move back to where I'd been before and get my old job back. I requested placement in the spring. If she can handle that, we'll see."
