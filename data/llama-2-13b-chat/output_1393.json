        "Summarize the following story in first person: About a year and a half ago, i gave birth to my last son. I have decided to not have any more children since then. However, that day was a day that truly changed my life forever. I remember that the night before i had gone to the hospital for having contractions. They told me i was in active labor and that they were going to admit me. Then, about an hour later, the contractions had slowed, so they decided to let me go home for the night. I thought that was ridiculous, but i left. While i was at home, i was not able to sleep or even stand comfortably. The next morning, I was still awake from the night before, crying due to the contractions. I was rushed to the hospital when i absolutely couldn't bare the pain anymore. Once i was there, my son was born no more than an hour and a half later. It was the first birth where i had my family with me. My other two sons were born out of state. It was very memorable and exciting to have all the love and support in the room. A day i will never ever forget."
