        "Summarize the following story in first person: My wife and I both have birthdays in June, so I scheduled some time off early in the month to celebrate. On the last day of work before the vacation, my father was in a severe car accident, another driver drifted into his lane and hit him in a head-on collision. The entire left side of his body was crushed. I went to see him in the hospital the next day when he was stabilized and had a unique conversation with him. On my way home, I told my wife \"I just had a conversation that people in movies have with someone before they die\". He told me that he loved me, he was proud of me, he loved my wife and son, and how important we are to him. That was the last conversation I had with him, at least where he was coherent. His condition went up and down like rolling waves, some days screaming in pain and other days completely unconscious, but never able to even answer basic questions like who he was, where he was, or who was president. I spoke with him and he described to me about how I was covered in slime, but not to worry, that he knew a bunch of rats that could clean me off. Hand restraints had to be put on him to prevent him from ripping out his IV's and other medical equipment. After being in the hospital for nine days, he was due to be discharged to a physical therapy rehab facility the next day. He had recovered enough that they could remove his restraints, and I told him once he was out of the hospital, I would bring him a cheesesteak from our favorite restaurant. I told him I loved him and I would see him the next day after work, as my vacation was ending. I go in to work the next day and within four minutes of arrival, I received a call from the hospital that he had died. The following week leading up to his burial was one of the most challenging weeks of my life for several reasons. My father and I were the only members of our family who maintained the familial religious beliefs, and part of my obligation to him as his son (the only son capable of doing so) I dressed him in certain religious clothing before the funeral home placed him in his casket. The idea of dressing my fathers corpse kept me up and night and gave me nightmares, but it was actually a very cathartic experience. He had an autopsy performed, so his body was in a plastic suit to prevent leakage from the incisions. While it sounds traumatic, it was a tender experience and a service I was glad to perform for him, as he had no one else able to do it."
