        "Summarize the following story in first person: People have always made fun of my eyes and how they look crooked. Growing up other kids would call me \"Crooked Eyes\" and tease me endlessly. Thinking back, I guess I struggled socially because of the way I was treated through school. Now that I have health insurance, I decided to get my eyes checked and see if there was anything that could be done. The eye doctor I visited told me that I could have surgery to have my eyes realigned. He reassured me that it was a safe procedure and would greatly improve the appearance. I didn't really need much time to think it over, and I immediately signed up for an appointment scheduled for three months later. I could barely sit still during those three months because I was overcome with joy and anxiousness. Despite not being able to see on the day following my surgery, I was so thrilled to finally have this procedure done. And once everything finally healed it was absolutely unbelievable! The doctor did a fabulous job! My eyes look normal for the first time in my life. Now I do not have to be so self conscious about the way I look. All those years of being teased are gone! I can't wait to go to my 10 year high school reunion and see everyone's faces!"
