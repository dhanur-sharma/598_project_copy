        "Summarize the following story in first person: My Grandmother is 94 years old and has always been a very mentally healthy and independent person. Recently, however, her health has been failing and she is in and out of the hospital every few weeks for one thing or another. She is very weak and needs constant attention and help. My uncle and his family are living with her to help take care of her and give her the attention she needs. As a child, I would spend at least one week of every summer break staying at her house to visit and we both always looked forward to it. So, in early June I decided to do that again, thinking it may be my last chance to do spend that much time with my Grandmother and to also help give my uncle and his family a bit of a break from taking care of her. The day before I was to travel, I was given the news that my Grandmother was again in the hospital with pneumonia and that she wasn't \"like herself.\" I decided to visit anyway. When I got there, it was late, but I made my way into her room and she was asleep so I sat in a chair that was in the corner and slept until morning. In the morning, I said, \"Hey! Grandma!\"But while her eyes were open and she pivoted them towards me, they were distant. She mumbled something when I hugged her which I took to be recognition that she knew who I was and was glad to see me. Over the course of the next few days, she was very weak and completely out of it. But then, suddenly, she started to regain her faculties and started to be able to talk and think more clearly like how I had remembered her. On the last day I was there, she was so strong and cogent that in a totally impromptu moment during a conversation about how she should write a poem about her situation to help cope, she made up an entire poem in her head. She wasn't strong enough to write, so she had me transcribe it and it was amazing. She had returned to how I remembered her in mind and spirit and we were able to really have a nice last day together before I had left. She's had issues since then however and I don't think she's been as good as that day and so I'm pretty protective and thankful for that moment/day I got to share with her."
