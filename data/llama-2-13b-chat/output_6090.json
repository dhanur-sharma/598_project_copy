        "Summarize the following story in first person: The cat was orange and white, I think they call these tabby cats but I am not too sure. The cat was huge and had big cheeks on his face. His eyes were a emerald green. When I felt him on my lap, I jumped and screamed so high I thought I might have made a hole in the roof of my car. The cat started to put and rub its body against my arm as if it already knew it. After I calmed down, the cat laid down next to me. I thought it was the strangest thing. I checked the cat for a collar and it had none. I did see it had some bald spots as if it had been in previous fights with other cats. I reached my hand out to touch it and it stretched and let me pet it. I wasn't too familiar with cats so I didn't know what to do but it was apparent to me that this cat chose me. After several minutes of petting, I decided to take the cat home with me. I was worried about what my husband would say but knew he wouldn't totally oppose to the idea. I came home and let my husband know what happened. The cat looked weak and tired so we decided to take it to the nearest vet to check its health. The cat was weak and dehydrated as I had speculated. Since we or I decided to keep it, the vet gave the car a round of shots and gave us a few tips on caring for a feral cat. It was definitely a stressful day but I hope it doesn't get too tough from here on out."
