        "Summarize the following story in first person: About four months ago I had a trip to Seychelles in Africa. I had always wanted to visit Africa and see the cultures and lifestyle. I enjoyed my stay there but one evening I was out hiking and took some weird fruit I wasn't accustomed to but was assured that  it was good by the locals. Because I am an adventurous person I decided to try it,which I did and in about an hour I had a bloated stomach and was belching. I could literally see my stomach getting bigger, and we were high climbing. I felt I had to use the ladies room, I ended up purging in the bushes. It was quite embarassing and fun at the same time but it was a night I will never forget. I took some of the fruit back home with me to show my mum. I vividly remember all the details like it was yesterday. For the very first time I rode an elephant and saw a 75 year old turtle. The local guide rubbed something on my stomach and in an instance I was normal again. The island was one of the best I have visited. The people are of Indian natives. It was also the first time I saw people worshipping snakes. They had Shrines and priests."
