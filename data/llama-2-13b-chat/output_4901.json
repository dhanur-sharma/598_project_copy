        "Summarize the following story in first person: Oh, yes. This was about my relationship with my ex and how it turned out poorly and led to some bad self doubt. My ex and I started out fantastically as friends and unfortunately that is where it should have stayed. We began well enough, having stayed up night after night chatting with one another and gaming with one another. We were young, love struck and despite some flawed starts of jealousy from both sides, we did well at first. Then after the relationship became official it became a nightmare to even survive within. This was after my previous relationship where I royally messed up in the emotional support department and let somebody nice down, so I was more than prepared to endure here as a, I guess, makeup for the last. However, that kindness was taken advantage of and I was manipulated, lost friends and stopped talking to people I once contacted daily. Likewise my personal hobbies deteriorated and I was more or less told to spend every waking moment with them. I cannot personally state all the things that went on, or the ways I was kept in the relationship because I feel like those are too personal, but needless to say I basically hated it. I had to wait for her to get bored of me, find another person to obsess over and let her dump me for things to be peaceful. So I exited that as a mess, both relationship wise and mentally. Hated them in general for the longest time and wondered if I did things wrong. Kind of hard to believe the person I met turned out to be like that, so I blamed myself for it at times. However, over time I learned that it wasn't my fault, I let it go and moved on. There's no easy way to do it, but you just have to take the blow, accept the time lost and stop letting more time slip away due to it. Thankfully I met somebody who would help me with that and she has been amazing. I really wish I could say all the ways she is, but I only have three thousand characters here! So I will say this. She's stubborn, dependable, cocky at times and had humor that matches mine. She's flawed, yet perfect if that makes sense. I didn't make her out to be unrealistic in my mind and she never required it either, so I'm happy to be with her. With this one I can move on without worry and know that even if something happens, it's not the end of the world."
