        "Summarize the following story in first person: Four months ago it was my 42nd birthday. I decided not to remind my family of my birthday coming up this year because I wanted to see if they would remember on their own. Usually I have to remind them, so this year I wanted to see what would happen if I didn't say anything. On the days leading up to my birthday, nobody brought it up at all. On my actual birthday I woke up and I was sad because nobody had done anything for me yet, and I really felt like everyone had forgotten about me. I was so upset that I told my family I was going out to do some errands but I ended up just driving to the target parking lot and sitting in my car and crying for a good thirty minutes. When I finally gathered myself together enough to drive back home, it was already dark outside. I pulled into my garage and didn't even notice all the cars that were parked outside my house. When I walked in the back door, at least twenty people jumped out of nowhere and yelled \"SURPRISE!\". I was so shocked that I started crying again. I thought that everyone had forgotten about me, but my daughter had secretly been planning me a surprise party all along. We ended up having a nice potluck dinner with everyone and had cake and my favorite flavor of ice cream. I was so thrilled that my daughter had taken the time to arrange all of this. I can't believe how silly it was that I was crying in my car just moments beforehand. I will not remind my family of my birthday again next year and see what happens. I can't wait to see what else my family will do for me."
