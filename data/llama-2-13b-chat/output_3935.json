        "Summarize the following story in first person: 14 weeks ago, we flew to Alaska to commence our trip.   I wasn't expecting much, as this wasn't my trip idea, but merely a concession to go with my friends.  At the helm of the floating idea was Diane, whom chose her dream location, Alaska.   She couldn't help herself either.  Stories of buildup of how amazing the trip will be was shared with the group, and she made no attempts to reserve expectations, and her reputation was now at a risk. After arriving, we relaxed for a day in the hotel, simply sharing stories and enjoying the restaurants nearby.  However, the day I will remember for a long time came the next day.  Diane was not exaggerating. The day started off on a cruise through the Alaskan waters.   On the cruise was the most fantastic sushi which made me feel regret that it was contained only on the ship.   Afterwards, noticing the pool empty in this cold climate, we took a swim, with a delightful contrast of the cold of the air compared to the warmth of the heated pool.   With some more time to spare before arriving at the grand finale, we enjoyed a game of putt putt, to which I ended with a +35 score due to a mixture of incompetence and alcohol.     Finally, we reached the grand finale, a large shelf of ice which calved before our eyes.   On the way back, we were even treated to the unadvertised sight of passing whales. We flew back the next day.  We will not soon forget our trip to Alaska."
