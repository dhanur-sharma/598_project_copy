        "Summarize the following story in first person: This story from life is about a conference I was invited to participate in as one of the speakers.  It has been a long time for such a conference to be planned about this subject which deals with the crystal skulls, were were a key part of the plot shown in the last Indiana Jones film that came out in 2008.  I had hoped to have the ability to help the conference coordinator with the planning of the conference. This advice would help to make it the best it could be for the attendees.  You see, I have helped to organize several such conferences in my past. However, my offer of such assistance was totally rejected. Therefore, I had to step back and let my friend, the coordinator, do the conference as she saw fit.  This was very hard for me to do but I released it. I knew closer to the time when the conference was to take place, I then would do my best to prepare a very informative and entertaining presentation to offer. Plus, I would have many interesting things at my booth to share and sell.  It should be noted, at the time this diary entry is being written - the conference did already take place.  And in some ways it happened in a form much better than I thought it would occur. It was personally successful for myself on all levels. Let me give some examples of what I proposed for the conference that was shot down.. #1 I thought we should have a panel discussion, which has worked at other conferences.  #2 - I have written a song on the subject of the conference to play.  #3 - I wanted to help to make sure all the speakers coming - got along with each other.  Anyway, it was a great conference and I was honored to be a key part."
