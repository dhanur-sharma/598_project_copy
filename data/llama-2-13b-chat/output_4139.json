        "Summarize the following story in first person: I hX thought that once I got over the feeling of being thirty that I would live my life like always. Little did I know that I was going to to be in for a whirlwind of a transition from my twenties to my thirties. After a few weeks passed I was able to finally feel like myself and not focus so much on the age I turned but more on how I felt. To why at that point I felt great , like was twenty two, but life threw me a surprise. It was a cold morning when I started to feel a little weird, I thought it was just fatigue so I pressed on. Midday I started to feel a bit weak and faint so I got off of work early to rest at home since I thought I was coming down with a cold. So I rested at home for the rest of the day and feel asleep. A few hours later I woke up soaked in my own sweat and feeling worse. I knew it was time to call my mother for her to check on me and when she did she told me I was running a high fever. I went to go get checked out and it turns out I had a.broncial infection that was risky. I has to take medication and a long time off of work to recover. The worst thing was that I had this for a while and I keep trying to get over it the holistic way but it didn't work which lead me. to believe that my body wasn't as it was. I felt horrible the first few days and I didn't have any rest. It was the first time in my life that I remember being that sick. Everything felt like it was a different reality since I was passed out most of the time. I never felt as bad as I did and it was a horrible feeling. After some time I started to get better and I finally was able to fully recover. It was a tough learning lesson for me to not take my health for granted and to thank God that I survived."
