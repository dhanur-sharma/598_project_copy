        "Summarize the following story in first person: It's been so long since I have been able to write. It has been a busy and emotional 2 weeks. So to get right into it, those deliquent kids in the apartment above mine were left alone again. They were playing with matches and wouldn't you know it they started a fire. It was bad for me but way worse for them. I can deal with water and smoke damage but they lost pretty much everything. Now there is a giant hole in the roof above my apartment. I am lucky in the sense that they were able to put me in a temporary apartment and that I will be fully covered by my renters insurance. My neighbors weren't so lucky. They decided to let their renters insurance lapse and they also lost so much. I don't understand why anyone wouldn't have renters insurance. Especially when you have little hellians living in the same building as you. The day after they let us into the area to gather some things and I over heard them laughing about the destruction they caused. Hearing those kids and just their lack of guilt makes me never want to have kids. I can only hope that they get the help they need or they could end up in prision or alot worse. Well thats all for now, I hope not wait so long before the next update."
