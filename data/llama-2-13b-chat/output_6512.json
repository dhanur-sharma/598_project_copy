        "Summarize the following story in first person: This year, jut a few months ago, both of my sister-in-laws became pregnant just a few weeks apart. The first sister-in-law, S, already has 4 children, and this will be her 5th. The second sister-in-law, T, is now several months into her 3rd pregnancy. I was very happy for them both, especially because T struggled with miscarriages and infertility before she was able to have her second child. This third baby was a welcome surprise for T. However, this is a touchy subject for me because it is possible that I may be physically unable to have children due to PCOS. Therefore, upon their announcement at a family gathering, I congratulated them and then had to excuse myself because I could not hold in my emotions. I went to the bathroom so I could privately cry and relieve some of the pain their announcement brought up. The rest of the get-together was rough and I had to work very hard to keep myself from showing my painful emotions. I do not think I was very successful because I was asked several times if I was okay. Each announcement through the years has been difficult, but this was the hardest of them all. Although I will love my new nieces and nephews when they get here, and I will attend their showers, it will not be easy to be around the celebrations without a feeling of emptiness and failure on my end. I have always wanted to be a mother. The experience of pregnancy is very, very important to me. I don't expect my sister-in-laws to take my feelings and fears into account, and I don't know how to express this situation to them."
