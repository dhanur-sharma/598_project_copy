        "Summarize the following story in first person: Dear Journal,When it happens, we're usually drinking. It starts out innocent enough, and the night usually begins with us having fun. Somewhere along the line someone says something that rubs one of us the wrong way. Last night, it was probably him. Or maybe it was me. I don't even know what triggered the fight, and it was our first physical fight in a very long time. Stress seems to get things going even more. It's just hard, because I feel like I have no one to talk to but a damn notebook. These pages are my only peace. All day every day, I'm cooking and cleaning and chasing Jane around the house. Don't get me wrong, I love my Jane. She was my fate, and something I wanted for so long. But it's hard having a toddler again, and it's hard having teenagers when Sam is never home. When he is home he drinks or sits on the couch all day watching Netflix or other dumb movies. He doesn't try to interact unless he's drinking, and when he's drinking there's only a brief moment in time where he's fun and not angry or annoying or ... everything else. Don't get me wrong, I love him. But the fight last night makes me feel as if staying with him for all these years was bad on my kids. Is it going to be bad on Jane too? Did we fuck up our children by making things work despite all the fights they've seen and the mean words we've said to each other. Last night made me feel as if I should leave...but I can't. I have no where to go. I sacrificed everything, my whole life for this family. I had to...someone had to...and yet now I'm stuck."
