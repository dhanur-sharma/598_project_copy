        "Summarize the following story in first person: On October 1 2019 I held my last remaining  Aunt's body as she died.  She may have been gone completely when I got there but I tried to find a pulse and detect respiration. I was afraid to even attempt CPR considering how frail she was.  I kept doing that until the ambulance arrived and took her outside and loaded her.  They spend 15 minutes trying to bring her back before leaving for the hospital. I followed the ambulance to the hospital calling my wife and telling her to go home to her mother in laws and stay there as I thought correctly that no good news were coming.  Just a few days before my aunt had celebrated her 90th birthday.  My mother who is turning 81 this November and their sole remaining cousin who had turned 100 a few weeks prior both attended.  It was beautiful to see all three of the oldest members of the family together, not knowing it would be the last for one of them. When I arrived at the hospital I walked to the ER and waited for news.  Eventually the Dr in attendance called for family members.  Me and her caretaker walked in to the room where my Aunts body was covered in a white sheet.  The Dr explained that she may have choked but according to her caretaker she collapsed while sitting at the kitchen table, we think massive heart attack.  What really stayed in my mind was the Drs words regarding the medications that were administered to her \"it was like we were using water. no response.\"I stayed there with her body for 3 hours until my cousin who lives 120 miles away arrived."

I feel guilt for not being able to save her.  I feel I will never forget the look on her caretakers face as she held her hand and said goodbye.  I wish I could turn back time.  I will never forget the sound of the machines beeping as she lay there lifeless.  I will never forget the smell of the hospital.  I will never forget the look of her body as I identified it.  I will never forget the pain I felt and still feel.  I know I did all I could but it wasn't enough.  I will never forget the last time I held her and she was still warm.  I will never forget the sound of her last breath.  I will never forget.\n\n"
