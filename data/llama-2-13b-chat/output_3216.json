        "Summarize the following story in first person: I remember tournament season like it was yesterday. I always thought of chess as something of a \u201cnerd sport\u201d; less of a sport and more of an assignment .. like homework. It wasn\u2019t until experiencing the play-through of chess and learning the significance of each piece that I began to take interest in it . Cut to a few months after my first game that I thought it would be an excellent idea to join the chess club, and eventually we found ourselves in a few tournaments; Everyone in my school that takes part in the tournament takes it very seriously. This isn\u2019t like a game of connect four, where you go, \u201cAww, man,\u201d and laugh when you\u2019re defeated. When you lose, it means(at least to us, and the other teams taking part) that you have lost something more than a game. Although deep down we all know that this is just a game; We also love how dignified it all seems. How much respect we all have for the game is what brings us all together I think. We had put together a team that was relatively well-rounded or so we thought, until we were knee deep in losses and on our last game, which of course is very stressful, even for someone who doesn\u2019t take it as seriously as us. We knew we would have to figure out a new strategy for next year and establish some new players. This would mean some players of the team would not be happy. But we probably would be. I knew that out of all the players, I wouldn\u2019t be one of the ones being cut. I was one of the best players we had. I felt bad for what we would have to. Ultimately though, I knew the members would understand. We would absolutely need to balance out the teams weaknesses with more seasoned players. There was no doubt about that."

As the tournament season progressed, we had become like family. We would meet up outside of school and go over strategies. I was learning more about my teammates than I ever had before. They were good people. And they were all better than me. I knew I would have to step up my game if I wanted to stay on the team. But it wasn\u2019t just about winning. It was about the journey. The journey of learning and growing with my teammates. The journey of becoming better players and better people. The journey of discovering the true meaning of sportsmanship and camaraderie. And so, as the tournament season came to a close, I knew that I would always treasure the memories of this experience. The thrill of victory, the agony of defeat, the bonds of friendship, and the lessons of sportsmanship. I had found something more valuable than a trophy or a medal. I had found a sense of belonging, a sense of purpose, and a sense of"
