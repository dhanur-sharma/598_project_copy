        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was shopping one day with my friend. We had decided to go shopping and get out of the house since she had just gotten cheated on by her ex. I wanted to get her to take her mind off him anyway, but we both needed a new dress as well. It was a perfect excuse! We went to the mall and went into some of the store. She really didn't see anything she liked for a wedding. I told her it probably was because she wasn't in the mood for love type things right now. My friend said that right now she's not even thinking about spending  money on someone's wedding, she just hated the idea of love. Someone walking by heard us talking and stopped us and told us that we shouldn't lose hope on love. My friend told her that she was just cheated on by her long time boyfriend and for right now men are scum. I started laughing and told the woman to ignore her, she's upset. The woman told us it was understandable, but to not take his actions out on all men. She made a good point about our friend's marriage and how she must have found a great man that wouldn't cheat if she's willing to celebrate her love with everyone else. I was like \"She's got a point!\" My friend said, \"Ok, ok! You got me! We'll go and look for a dress now and I'll be a little less bitter about men...tomorrow!\" and we all laughed and the woman said to go to the dress shop down near Macy's. She said they had great dresses and they were reasonably priced and if we didn't mind dresses that had been worn before, they had great cheap dresses and the owner would probably give us a deal if we liked something but it was out of our price range. I was like \"I don't mind preowned, most of my shopping is thrifted anyway.\" So we go to the dress place, it has so many good dresses and we tried on and liked so many of them. We were helped by the clerk and decided on 3 dresses we loved each and since the prices were great, we were getting all 3 of them. I joked with the clerk that we were told the manager would cut us a deal because some random woman told us about this place. The clerk called to the back and asked if she could give us a deal and the stranger that talked to us came out and said \"Yea, you should cut them a deal. Ring up the cheapest dress and ring them up for that one and let them have the other dresses for free.\" I was shocked but thankful! We've sent a lot of people looking for dresses there!"
