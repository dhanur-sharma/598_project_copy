        "Summarize the following story in first person: This day was a great day.  My parents live with us in the basement and they went to visit my sister in another state.  We decided while they were gone we were going to do a whole bunch of fun things we would normally not be able to do while they were here and we had to take care of them.  On this day we bought ice cream, chips and made cookies.  We made a list of all the 80's and 90's movies that we wanted to see.  We made a \"bed\" on the living room floor and got all of our junk food out.  We watch video's and ate junk food all day long.  We would go from one movie to another and only stop if we needed the bathroom or more junk food.  After part of the day was over we changed TV's and moved to a real bed as even with all the pillows and blankets we were starting to feel the floor digging in.  My son was so excited about this day.  Some of the movies he loved and some he was not that impressed with.  My husband was really relaxed and happy.  It was a day of no one having to say no or argue with our pre-teen that he would not be allowed to do something.  We would love to do this day again.  We are waiting for summer when the next opportunity will be to do movie marathon day again."
