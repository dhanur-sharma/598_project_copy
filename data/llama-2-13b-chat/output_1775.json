        "Summarize the following story in first person: 2 months ago, one of the worst things I could think of almost happened to me. My mom was going into surgery, she had a weak heart--Pulmonary Edema. I was extremely concerned, but I had assuaged those fears by believing in the skill of the doctors working with her. I guess that wasn't enough, though. People make mistakes. The surgery went wrong, and my mom was put into a coma in order for doctors to go from extending her lifespan to saving her life. She was in it for a few days, and I was in pieces. My mother was dying, and there was nothing I could do about it. I waited by her side for days. I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep, I just wanted her to be ok. My dad was worse, though. He couldn't even come in without bawling. He was a strong man, and this was the first time I'd ever seen him just lose it. He was crying so much, I just wanted to hug him and tell him everything would be ok. I was more convincing myself though. Eventually she pulled through, and it was the happiest I ever was. I'm going to make sure she knows how much we love her from now on."
