        "Summarize the following story in first person: Dear Diary,I'm so sorry it's taken me so long to write about this, but I've been so busy lately that I haven't had time to write. I'm still amazed at what happened two weeks ago, and have to tell you about it! You know how I did that DNA test a while ago? Well I got the results back, and there was actually a cousin I never knew I had who lived just a mile away in our little senior community! From what I understand, she's a cousin on my father's side, the daughter of his sister. I guess there was some bad blood between her and her parents when she was young, and so she ran away. I'm not sure if my crazy aunt (she really is a piece of work) ever tried to look for her or filed a missing person's report or anything, but this missing cousin ended up right near me after all these years! It took me a few days, Diary, to get up the courage to try to contact her. Finally, I looked her up on the internet and found a number for her. I dialed, said who I was and what the DNA test had revealed, and, surprisingly, she was so thrilled to hear from me! We made a date for coffee at the little shop that's part of our community. When I walked in, I could spot her right away. I could see the family resemblance right away! We must have talked for three hours! Turns out after she left, she got in with a bad crowd, but turned her life around after she got pregnant. She raised her kid the best she could (he turned out great and such a handsome young man!) and worked her way up to head buyer for her company. What's even more amazing is that she's a horror movie fan, just like me! I'm looking forward to hanging out with her more, and to meeting her son as well. Gotta go, Diary. So much work to do, but I wanted to share this with you! Millie"
