        "Summarize the following story in first person: I had been in a serious relationship for about 5 years. I met him in high school and eventually ended up dating. We started a family together and I thought this was it, we would be together forever. I was completely in love with him. We had just decided I would quit my job to stay home and take care of our son, daycare was just too expensive for us. I quit my job and the very next day he tells me he doesn't want to be with me. He told me he didn't love me anymore and he didn't think he ever would. My broke into a million pieces. You hear that saying often but now I actually understand what it means. I was suddenly a single mother, jobless, homeless and heartbroken. I ended up staying with my father and step mother, who helped me more then they probably realized. They were there for me and kept me up until I could get back on my feet again. They helped me heal and get back out there. I never thought I would feel okay again, but after some soul searching and healing even me and my ex have become friends again. I realized during this time that even when things seem like they could never possibly get better, they always will. It will not always be easy, and it will not always happen fast."
