        "Summarize the following story in first person: Lately I have been having some ongoing problems related to the infection I developed.  The infection went septic and I am having ongoing problems related to Kidneys, and neurological deficits, that have affected the way I live and work.  Hopefully this will start to clear up, as I have been on the antibiotics since the infection and will have to be on the antibiotics for at least another 6 months.  I feel tired and fatigued all of the time and the antibiotics are causing problems in my intestinal systems.  I wish that I had decided to live with the pain from my spinal problems rather than having the surgery.  Sometimes the cure is worse than the sickness.  I continue to see so many different doctors related to these problems.  I see the surgeon every three months, so that he can check on the healing.  I see a cardiologist every 3 months so that he can monitor any heart issues which may have been aggravated by the infection.  I see a Kidney specialist every 3 months to monitor kidney functions that have been impaired by the infection.  I see an infectious disease specialist to monitor the infection and its abatement.  I see a specialist for my arteries every 6 months to monitor any affects that may be going on with my arteries.  I see my primary care doctor every 3 months to coordinate everything going on with the other doctors.  To say the least this is rather monotonous going back and forth to all of these doctors.  It has also become expensive as each of the visits to the specialists carry a $45 copay under my insurance.  All in all this experience has been a pain in more ways than one."
