So I went near him and asked him whether he was okay or not, he said yes and I told him to get up and go. But he did not get up, instead he was just looking at me with anger. I felt very bad and I ran away from there as fast as I could. I am still thinking about that incident and I am feeling very bad. But I know that I did nothing wrong and I just helped the person who was in need. I hope that they will understand me and forgive me.\n\n"
