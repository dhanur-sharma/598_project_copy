        "Summarize the following story in first person: This story takes place about three months ago. It was the end of May, and it was a beautiful day in my home town. A group of old high school friends and current best friends decided to get together for a psychedelic adventure at a buddy's house. One friend watched over us all sober as a safety precaution. The other three took high doses of psychedelics. I myself only took a very small threshold dose, as I was not in a mental state for a full one. It was awesome hanging out with my bros like were were young again. I hadn't seen Andy in over a decade, and he has been so depressed, on that day he was as giddy as could be. My friend George had a very rough time and did not have fun, while Chad took care of him. Bob took the most of all, and was having a blast in his own world. I decided to retreat to the shed, for some quiet and meditate, as everyone else was busy. It was fantastic, I was able to work out many of my anxiety and panic issues on that day, or at least identify why they are happening better. It was incredibly therapeutic. More so than any traditional therapy by far. The drug allowed me to look at my thoughts from a new perspective, and I was able to see things so clearly I could not at all before within my mind and how it functions. I am a much better person for it, and feel more mentally sound than I have in years. The day ended slowly without much commotion, but we all had a blast. The funniest part was when Andy saw a ton of ants in the yard and said \"They out here.\" The timing was just so hilarious, but you had to be there to understand. I am so happy that I decided to take part, it will be one of my life long memories, as where I started to finally heal from my mental issues, and reconnected with long lost best friends from high school. I hope we can do it again some day, it was better than any vacation I've taken as far as stress relief goes by far. The names in this story have been changed for anonymity."
