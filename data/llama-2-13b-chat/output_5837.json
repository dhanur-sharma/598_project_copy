        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was 4 months ago and it surely seems like life was completely meaningless before I met Natasha.  It was funny really, because at first we hated each other.  Always screaming at one another and almost getting physical on more than one occasion, Natasha and I somehow found a common ground on which to truly connect and bond.  Next, we fell in love.  I never would have thought that I could actually be someone who got lucky enough to meet my soul mate.  Boy was I wrong.  We had already gotten into numerous altercations at this point, nonetheless, it was a beautiful rainy day. That's right, rainy.  I love the rain and so does she.  We are antiheroes of sorts and so it was in the rain as the thunder boomed and the lightning lit up our faces on the back patio of our mutual friend Cole's Home buying anniversary celebration.  It felt as if time itself stopped and we entered into another dimension.  A realm of bliss and magic where all of our dreams and desires were fulfilled dancing in the pools of light that were our own pupils.  Since then, things have been, well, just exponentially better as time passes.  I certainly can see myself growing old with Natasha and I cannot wait to tell our grandchildren the tales of our beautiful journeys together.  I have to add in however, that it is vital not to just take for granted the people that we are brought together with.  It most likely is for a purpose and it can be easy to burn bridges beyond repair."
