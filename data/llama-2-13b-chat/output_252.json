I was very depressed. I found comfort in the fact that they are going to be well taken care of. Plus one of the cats were adopted to a girl i know personally so I'm able to check on him. She send me pictures and videos. My other cat was adopted a few weeks ago. I knew she wasn't going to last at the shelter. She is very friendly  and out going so I knew she was gonna charm someone . I wish it did not go this way . I try to the positive In everything . I doubt i will every own another pet though. I still look at old pics. I cant take the heartache. I still love cats. I follow pages online. I maybe foster. I also maybe volunteer. Or open up a shelter"
