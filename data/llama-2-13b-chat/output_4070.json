Exactly three months ago today, our little girl was born! We named her Kate and she is the absolute sweetest baby! We have decided that she will probably be our last baby! It's a little bittersweet thinking of that concept but I mean, our oldest child is in college! Speaking of, our oldest child, Will, gave us quite the news this weekend! He is getting married to his long time girlfriend Stacy AND they are pregnant, due in March! AHHH! We couldn't believe it! I am so excited for him but at the same time I kinda wish they had waited on the baby until they had gotten married. Anyways, I want to be supportive and I really am elated for them. I can't wait to be a grandma in March! Yikes I really should stop having babies especially now that I'm a grandma! Wow, I feel old! Anyways, that's what has been happening recently. I'll update you in a bit!"
