        "Summarize the following story in first person: One of my favorite bands was touring, and I actually had a chance to see them in my state on this tour, on a day I would be able to go.  Traveling on the highways makes me nervous because of all the unexpected stresses that can happen but I set that aside and bought the tickets.  In anticipation of some stresses I tried to mitigate that by purchasing the special up close and determined parking, and a fast pass so I wouldn't have to wait in line.  I even surprised myself by driving the whole way to the city.  I drove to the otherskirts of the city to a place we planned to eat.  From there things got stressful because parking was difficult, and it was a busy pedestrian area.  The parking meters wouldn't work and the person I was with was aggravated that I didn't just want to park there anyway.  I was worried about being towed in a city that wasn't mine, shortly before this thing I wanted to do.  We ended up getting a new parking spot but that was strike one.  After that we found out way to the venue okay and parked relatively easily.  It was a pleasant day, not too hot, and it was nice to find the fast pass line to be not very long.  Then when we arrived for the outdoor concert we were given nice little lawn chairs to sit in.  We sat our chairs directly behind the back railing of the front standing room area.  We had a good view and the closest area you could sit on with the lawn chairs.  I started to feel more relaxed and ventured off on my own to buy a t-shirt while my partner saved our spot.  Unbeknownst to me, my partner was very uncomfortable in the little chairs and started to have negative feelings about the situation they found themselves in.  When I returned and mentioned I saw they were selling beers, my partner snapped at me in front of other people, why I hadn't gotten them one, then got up in a huff to go do it themselves.  I had to try to ignore that comment for the sake of appearances and to try not to ruin my night as I was essentially stuck here.  The rest of the evening proceeded find until the band came one and almost immediately what one would call an obnoxious frat boy took up the space directly in front of me, and the people next to me.  He was annoying for 90% of the concert.  The concert itself, was great.  The band put on an absolutely great show, the evening was pleasant, it was an outdoor venue, and it wasn't too hot.  When leaving on the way home, we got lost because I wanted to listen to the radar detector, which was actually wrong.  So it made for even more tense moments.  I decided at that point I was done with concert travel for a while."
