        "Summarize the following story in first person: Recently I took a trip to Las Vegas. This trip was all for my brother's birthday who at the time was officially of drinking age. What I experienced was pretty weird and very strange. Being a night person I woke up around 1:00 pm that day. It was day two of our Vegas trip and we just made some money playing small stakes on some slots that day. At least I did my brother wasn't as lucky and was down some money. We made our way back to our room because my brother was pretty drunk at that time and was already pretty upset about losing so much money. Sitting on the bed though I still couldn't sleep probably due to the fact of my time clock. I decided to go back down to play some slots and told my brother I was going. After getting down there I felt an urge to go to the roulette wheel instead of slots. This would turn out to be a huge mistake later. It wasn't even the real roulette it was automated. I lost the money I had won previously and decided to get some more money. I betted on my usual numbers and the wheel would land 8 greens in a row depleting me of my bank balance and the rest of the money I had for the trip. I made my way back to my room sad and upset I would not play roulette for a long long time. It made me despise the game and I decided I would rather stick to slots. All in all it was a learning experience for me."
