        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was starting to hate my jeep, because it kept taking forever to have it repaired, it was deeply concerning so I tried to get it fixed again. i was at the repair shop and someone that i didn't really know offered me a car that they didn't want to use anymore. so they gave it to me, and i accepted it because it was in better shape than my jeep was and it was a great time. I'm very grateful for this opportunity to have a newer car. that is in better shape and i no longer have to worry about my jeep breaking down, it will cost me less in the long run with this new car to. it'll be really great so i can't wait to start using it. it'll be certainly fun to use this over and over again. I really appreciate the random person who gave this to me. it was really a good time i suppose. This happened about a week ago. i was just getting my jeep fixed and a random person called me and offered up a new vehicle that they weren't using anymore, it was really great and i appreciate it.  This will change my life for good because it will give me the opportunity to live stress free regarding my vehicle and i wont have to spend more money on it. I hope that someone else will get the same fortune. This person was great. I really appreciated what they did for me."
