        "Summarize the following story in first person: I am going to write about my miracle baby's firsthand preschool. She was born 13 years after my oldest and 9 years after my middle daughter. She and I have been together for 4 years while the others were in school, and now it was her turn. We got up early and wen t to the \"senior walk\" of my oldest for her senior year. On the way back to her school, she decided that she do not want me to walk her in. She simply wanted to hop out and go in her self. She hopped out and got hugs from all of the teachers. I cried watching my independent, confident and happy kid strutting her stuff into the school. I cried. I ugly cried all the way home. I didn't know what to do with myaelf, alone during the day. I didn't want to go to the grocery store alone. I was proud of her being this way and happy, but I was anxious and alone. She is doing amazing. I am surviving and started long solo runs."
