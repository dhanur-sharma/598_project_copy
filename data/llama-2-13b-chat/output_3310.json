        "Summarize the following story in first person: I am by all definition a typical sports mom. When my daughter started playing softball two years ago I got very involved in the organization. I am at every practice and game and know every girl on the team as well as their parents by name. We all hang out and the parents as well as the players have become very close. We all cheer on every kid on the team and celebrate every victory as well as feel every loss. My daughter has been on undefeated teams the past two years which puts  lot of pressure on the girls. This year they were invited to play in a very tough tournament which involved a big time commitment from the players and parents. The first weekend of the tournament was tough with a lot of cheering and yelling and nail biting. The girls won all three games that first weekend putting them in the championship the following weekend. We played the first game and won then lost to a tough team the second game which forced us to play a third game against another team. We won that game at this point everyone was exhausted. We had an hour to get the girls fed and ready for the last game of the tournament against the team that beat us. This would determine who would be champion. We stated the game and it was back and forth hit for hit play for play. Both teams were good! The last inning we start to pull ahead and it starts raining. We had to decide to play or call a hold on the game. Everyone agreed to keep going and the girl played their exhausted hearts out while we cheered and screamed and held our breath on every play. Our last girl was up to bat and she brought two runs in WE WIN!! Every player and parent rushed to the field soaking wet in the middle of the rain cheering and snapping pictures while the girls shook hands with the other team. I was so excited to see them receive their championship trophies and make memories that would last a lifetime."
