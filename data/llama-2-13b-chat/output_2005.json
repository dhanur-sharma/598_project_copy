        "Summarize the following story in first person: It still feels surreal. I recently got married to the love of my life. The planning might not have gone very smoothly but we both agreed on one thing - we wanted a small, intimate wedding. We decided that 50 guests is ideal for the wedding we both envisioned. The challenging part is choosing who among our family and friends are included in that list. That list is pretty tight! Well, we first made our own list. We decided that each of us get to choose 25 people each to include in the list. After that, we both discussed if we're okay with it. It was a very long discussion for such a short list. It was of course because of the fact that certain people might feel left out if we didn't invite them. However, that was how we wanted it so that's how it was going to be. It is our wedding after all. Anyway, after the tedious decision on who are invited, everything else went smoothly. Even the weather was on our side during the wedding day. It was drizzling the day before and the sky looked a bit gloomy all week before our wedding day. The weather forecast even said that it is going to rain. However, on the day, the weather was on our side. We got married by the coast and the sky and ocean was very nice at that time. It was a very intimate, solemn and amazing celebration. A day we both surely will not forget."
