        "Summarize the following story in first person: Today I had a party for my 25th birthday.  It was a surprise party that my friends had planned out without me knowing.  They told me later that they had been working on this thing for weeks!  I do recall them asking me weird questions here and there, like if I was close with certain people or if I liked certain colors.  At the time, I didn't think anything of it.  One of my friends and I went out for lunch just so she could be the one to drive me back home and alert everyone when they could yell \"SURPRISE!\"  And that isn't even the biggest surprise for me at the party.  The past few months I have been telling my friends about a guy at work.  I kind of have a crush on him and talk him up constantly.  Somehow, they got his number and invited him to the party.  They may have even told him about my crush because it was the craziest thing.  After I had blew out my candles and things were calming down, he came over to talk to me.  He had a huge smile on his face and told me he was having a great time with all my friends.  I told him that they were great people.  He then proceeded to tell me that he always wanted to hang out with me but was too shy to ask me.  I blushed so hard!  But I told him that I felt the same way and we both agreed to go out on a date.  It was like a fairytale ending to the perfect story!  I couldn't believe that all it took for an in was a surprise birthday!"
