        "Summarize the following story in first person: Two months ago, I went to visit Sedona in Arizona. I was in need of healing, both physically and mentally. This was because I was going through a rough patch in my life. Arizona is one of my favorite places, so I decided to go there. I wanted to see if the vortexes there could provide me with any sort of healing or wellness. These are centers of energy there that I believe are good for healing the soul. The most surprising thing there was when i ran into an old friend that I hadn't seen in years from school. I believed this was a sign of fate. We both spent hours meditating there. It was a serene and uplifting experience. The views were gorgeous, and it was good to get the fresh air. There's a reason why it's one of my favorite places. I wish I could have stayed there longer. It definitely helped improve my frame of mind. After that, I felt more relax and at ease with myself."
