        "Summarize the following story in first person: so6 month ago i moved from north florida to south florida .it was a pretty scary experience as i have a home full of stuff. it was scary moving all my valuables treasures and all the other stuff me and my girlfriend have worked hard to obtain. frist we had to find a place to stay so we looked it was stressful until we found a place. finally we were ready for the move. my girlfriends parents helped us. her parents and myself dont always see eye to eye. i have loaded up moving trucks and moved before so i had an idea of how i wanted it done.  we started by moving the heavier of ll the items into the trailer. they wanted to stack everything their way and i didnt feel as if it was safe. we talked about it and they got on my nerves quite a bit. we finally got it all loaded up i wasnt very satisfied with how it was all loaded up. we got about 10 mins down the road and the fridge her parents loaded up shifted and fell on a bookcase. i was very mad because i knew they had no intention of replacing the bookcase. i was very very mad. the 4 hour drive we had ahead of ourselves was very tense and very enjoyable. when we got to the house and saw all the damage i was devastated. I learned my lesson about trusting them with such a job. my bookcase is still busted i havent replaced it becuse i dont have the money. the whole ordeal was very messy."
