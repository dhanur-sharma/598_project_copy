        "Summarize the following story in first person: This has been some year for me. When I was a teenager I dreamed of my own family one day. The same dream I've had most of my life. But now that dream has died. I have never been someone woman desire or like. I thought I could overcome that obstacle and have my dream family one day. But it all came crashing down this year. I waited to long and gave to little effort to my dream. Now my health is slowly worsening and no one wants to be with me. It hurts so much when I think of all the years wasted instead of following my dream. When I look at the rest of my life. I will spend the rest of my days regretting my choices and the chances not taken. It's hard to believe but my life is a sad country song. All I can do now is get through each day. Try to make what time I have left have some meaning."
