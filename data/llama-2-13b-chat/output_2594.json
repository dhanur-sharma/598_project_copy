        "Summarize the following story in first person: Around 3 months ago, I had this amazing experience involving a trip overseas that has change my perspective on things. What started out as a fun trip for my world history class ended up helping my decide what I want to do with my life. During this trip, I met people and saw things that I had seen in textbook but never in person. It was a sort of transcendent experience for me; I never wanted it to stop. It was this trip that I really started focusing on my life beyond school. For my trip overseas, we as a class was offered the chance to go to Italy. the main point of the trip was to absorbs the art and culture of the region where great artists Davinci and Michelangelo. During this trip, me and a group of classmates were able to enter one of the churches, and what I saw inside changed me. We were surrounded by rich, striking art depicting angles, man, God, and animals. I felt a deep, deep sense of peace and relaxation as I walked around the church, letting all this art and culture wash over me like a tsunami. After leaving the church, which was very hard for me to do, I knew what I wanted to do with my directionless life. I really wanted to pick up art after that trip. I changed my major from undeclared to art immediately after coming back from the trip. I talked to my friends about the art teachers they had in prior semester to get a sense of what the classes were like, and I went to the art department to talk to the professors directly. I started my life as an art student this semester, and the experience so far has been all that I imagines and more. I have never felt more fulfilled as I am now, and I have never enjoyed going to school as I am enjoying doing so now."
