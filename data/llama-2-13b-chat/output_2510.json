        "Summarize the following story in first person: We had waited so long for this day. It was finally here with us. The most important day for my Cousin Brian who was finally getting married to his long time Girlfriend Alicia. Alicia had been well known in our family as this humble down to earth Lady, graduated and working as a Nurse in a local Hospital. She had been engaged to Brian for as long as three years. Preparations had been made and the day was set. Everything was in place. The wedding gown was designed by Brian's High school deskmate Florence who had gone into designing. She loved designing since her days in high school.   Brian's parents were the happiest as he was going to wed on her Mothers' Birthday. It was to be held at the Park where his parents held their Jubilee Celebration. It was looked upon to be one of the colourful weddings held in the family.  Brian was enthusiastic and Happy as well. The most important day of his life was just a day away. We were all seated, quiet as the nice music played. Every body waiting for the time The bride and the Bridegroom were to take their vows. Whe the Preacher stood and read the scripture, every one was wating to hear the vows being taken. Brian took his place and took the Oath of life. It was Alicia's time and instead of ''I do'' Brian closed his eyes in pain. She instead said, ''NO I DON'T'' When he openened his eyes, the Bride was gone, gone forever."
