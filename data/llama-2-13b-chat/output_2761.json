        "Summarize the following story in first person: The significance of my story is one of redeeming yourself, and that you can sometimes turn back the clock, and correct the course you're on. For years after high school, I attended college with the intent of being the first in my family to walk away with a degree. I also wanted to be involved in college, and I got so wrapped up in Greek life, I paid no attention to my physical health. I went about 3 years being a glutton and a drinker, although never becoming an alcoholic. My ties were eventually broken with my fraternity, and I went completely down south, and gained quite a bit of weight. To this day I'm trying to finish my degree, but this story is about making change and maintaining discipline. About 6 months ago I decided enough is enough, and that I want to recapture my athleticism, my original form. Now, this didn't come easy, as I knew that if I were to stray any farther, that I may never get any better. This process was no easy task, and was less about obtaining a certain weight, as with all great things come with discipline and practice. I needed to get my diet straight, and to stop binge eating, and to take multiple small meals as opposed to one big one. More than that, I need an intense training regimen that would target a fat burning heartbeat, alongside High Intensity Interval Training. It was painful. But as Eric Thomas once said, \"You're already hurt, get a reward for it.\" I fought, I fell, I got back up again, and I won. 6 months from when I first started, I have last 60 lbs and continue to lose more. My journey isn't at an end, but I have forever changed my lifestyle. I do fully intend to finish off my degree and become a teacher, and my my new endurance and overall self respect has given me newfound ambition."
