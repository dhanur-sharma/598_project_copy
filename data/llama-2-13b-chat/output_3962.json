        "Summarize the following story in first person: My daughter moved far away from home.  When she met and got engaged to a Canadian who was working here in the US, I hoped he would try to get residency here and they would stay.  But it's hard to get legal status nowadays, even for married couples, so they decided to move to Montreal, where he is from.   She has already started the process for residency there.  I miss her so much!  She's been gone for about 4 months now and I still can't get used to not seeing her every few days.  I was spoiled because we did spend a good amount of time together. I miss watching 90 Day Fiancee with her and talking about it (she can't get it in Canada!) and having Sunday dinners with them.  We do message almost every day and talk a few times a week but I miss her SOOOO much.  I am touched that even though she has her own grown up life now that she still sends me a meme or a note every day and keeps me updated on what's going on in her life.  I plan to go visit her in the Spring but that's still a long time away.  I'm trying to convince her to come for Christmas.  I can't imagine the holidays without here.  Some days I feel like a piece of my heart is missing.  She is an adult but she will always be my little girl."
