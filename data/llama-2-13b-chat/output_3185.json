        "Summarize the following story in first person: I have been working as a head custodian at a University student center for the past five years. The job was a step down in pay for me, but it worked at the time. When I was hired I was promised that my boss would be retiring soon and I could advance. I took the job with the understanding that I could quickly take a management position. A year went by and I was still stuck in the same place. My supervisor keeps saying he will retire but in the end pushes it off for another six months. Five years later I am still in the same place and keep hearing the same promises. I was finally to the point of looking for a new job when I got the word that my boss had submitted his retirement paperwork. I got a call from the director to meet him in the office to discuss my future. He said that he had been impressed with my dedication and work ethic. He had decided that they did not need to look outside to fill the position and that I would be be taking over the position effective immediately.  This new position carried with it a large raise and a lot more responsibilities.  I was thrilled because I have worked for this for a long time and my hard work and patience had finally paid off. With the extra money I can finally get a house for my family and pay off some of our debts which will be as huge relief. It goes to show me that hard work is rewarded in the end."
