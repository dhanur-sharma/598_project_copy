        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was the first summer in my new house and I was excited to build some new memories in the new house. Upon moving in the house, I knew the house had heat but no central ac unit. I expected there to be some minor issues with the heat during the summer but the house became to hot without no ac. To remedy the matter, I decided to buy two AC units for the house, one for upstairs and one for downstairs. The units worked fine all summer without no complications and cooled the house down perfectly. After some time, I noticed there was water leakage near the downstairs unit but did not think much of it. As I recall as well, the units seemed as though they were not exuding as much cool air as before as well. As a few weeks went by, the leak became worse and then the unit upstairs began to leak. Once I noticed the water by the second unit, I surmised the units were the cause but thought they were minor issues. After a week a so and the water began to increase, I decided I had to find a solution. I did not have the money to send both units in for repair so I decided to look up information if I could correct the issues myself. I researched the issue on YouTube on seen the instructions for properly cleaning the units to clear the blockage that causes the leakage. I decided to work on each unit one week at a time and cleaned out the debris that filled the units. I followed the instructions from the videos to the letter and once completed, the units were working as new. I also found the information to clean the filters and restore them and now the leaks have stopped and the units are back to normal."
