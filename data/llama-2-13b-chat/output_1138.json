        "Summarize the following story in first person: Three months ago my brother died in a car wreck. He was hit by a drunk driver whose four wheel drive pickup smashed into the driver's side of my brother's small, Toyota Yaris, killing my brother instantly. My brother was only 20 years old, still studying at college and had only begun to live his life. My youngest brother was the baby of the family being the youngest of 5. He was the only brother so was especially cherished by his 4 older sisters. He was studious, giving, caring and tried to do the right thing at all times. He volunteered at the homeless shelter in his college town. He attended mass every week. He took time to keep in touch with out parents and with all of our sisters. My family is devastated. This is our first loss in our family and none of us are quite sure how to deal with the hurt. We are close, all live in the same town and have each other but that doesn't seem to assuage any of the hurt or loss in our hearts. My mother has turned to the church, talking to our priest, praying and attending functions. My father has turned inward, trying to heal himself. My sisters and I have tried to help our parents but as we are suffering as well it has been a botched job at best. My sisters and I can help each other though, lending a sympathetic ear at least. We are still muddling through this and I don't know that my family will ever completely get over the loss of our baby brother. My little brother was an avid outdoors person who loved to hike, canoe and camp. Because of this my sisters and I are thinking of creating a sort of memorial along one of his favorite hiking trails in our town. The trail has a program where you can plant a tree and/or pay for a bench along the trail which helps fund the trail. I want to do both, plant a tree which will shade the bench as it grows, with a plaque showing it was donated in my brother's name. I think this would be a wonderful way to memorialize my little brother as he loved being outside hiking while always having his old Pentax film camera along with him. As I write this I find I have made the decision, I will do this for sure, plant a tree for my brother and provide a place for weary hikers to sit in memorial to him."
