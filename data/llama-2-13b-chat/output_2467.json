        "Summarize the following story in first person: My husbands birthday is on the forth of July and this year both of our girls came to our house to have a birthday party. They both brought their husbands and our oldest brought our grandson. On of the son-in-laws brought his grill and he cooked hamburgers and hot dogs on the grill. My youngest brought a yummy apple pie and my oldest brought cupcakes for his birthday cake. Instead of candles, which we forgot to get we put sparklers in the cupcakes for the candles. This was probably the most surprising thing of the afternoon, trying to get the happy birthday song sang before the sparkler ruined his cupcake. We then let off a ton of fireworks in the patio area. They were all safe and fun and my grandson had a wonderful time. After we had food we all gathered up and went down town for the forth of July parade. There were military marchers. There was many emergency trucks and even some clowns and horses too. The parade was actually long for a small town. We thought about going to the fair grounds to watch the fireworks, but it was late and we were tired. We came home and the girls played some games on the switch. My grandson showed me a game that he was creating on the switch. We cleaned up the kitchen and put everything away. My husband opened his presents and he seemed to have a wonderful day. It was a great birthday."
