        "Summarize the following story in first person: I needed a break from the usual January to December busy work life so I fixed 12 days leave for the end of the year. I work in Vancouver and I have an exciting relative in the US who have always wanted me to come around. He told me a lot about New York where he stays and I have since then been wanting to have a view of the big city. So six months ago, after receiving my paid leave, I planned for my New York trip. I packed more than enough clothes as I can't be so sure which one I will feel like wearing. I had another suitcase for my shoes. I needed to show the world I can be very fashionable than that nerd they see on suit. In it was all sort of shoe type; sneakers, brogue, slip on, vans, boot. I booked a flight for New York and I printed the online invoice. Gave my dog to the neighbor for safe keeping till I'm back. Fast forward to New York, I had a nice stay there; the food, the city lights, the busy streets and all made it so much an enjoyable experience. I didn't know it was about to turn sour when on the day I was to leave for the airport and fly home, there was a heavy gridlock. The traffic was so locked that I silently prayed it should be free. I arrived at the airport some 10 minutes after the schedule time. I knew I have missed my flight to Vancouver. I walked up to the receptionist and explained my ordeal to her. She keyed into my plight as she understood it might cost me my job as I stayed a day to my resumption. She fixed me up to the next flight which wasn't a direct flight but will still take me to Vancouver. I was happy that such people still exist. She said \"You today, Me tomorrow\". That line will stick with me forever."
