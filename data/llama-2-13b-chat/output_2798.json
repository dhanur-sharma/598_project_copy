        "Summarize the following story in first person: Moving a long distance is a very stressful process, especially when you are moving away from home. It's hard not only physically, with having to sort and pack and sell your things. It's hard emotionally too - leaving behind family and friends. I left behind all of my family and most of my friends - minus a few that live in Colorado already. It was sad to drive away but I was glad to have my dad with me. We saw a lot of interesting sights on our travels, including a family of moose. They were tall and elegant and beautiful but also scary to watch from the road. One of the highlights of the trip was the food we got to eat. I made sure to have a lot of BBQ and Cajun before we left Louisiana. I would not be able to have it again until I came back for Christmas in a few months. My dad and I enjoyed the time to relax from the road and also eat good food together. We ate a lot and then would be super full getting back into the car for the long drive ahead. One of the worst things that happened on our trip was a flat tire that happened in Texas. We were far away from other people and had to wait hours for triple A to come and help us fix it. Even though it was November it was luckily not too cold and we didn't freeze while we waited. I was very glad to have my dad as company or I would have been terrified waiting in the car in the middle of nowhere for that long. It was sad when my dad had to leave to go back home. I was alone in my new apartment and still had a lot of work left to do. I was scared to start my new job. But I knew that I could handle it and my new adventure."
