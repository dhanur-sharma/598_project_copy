        "Summarize the following story in first person: A few months ago, I took a road trip with my 2 and a half year old twins to visit family. My husband and I had recently learned that I was pregnant again and I wanted to tell our families in person and my husband wanted to take time to do some renovations on the house while we were out of town. My husband's grandmother had been visiting so first I drove her back to her hometown, where most of my other in-laws lived as well. We made a stop at my brother-in-law and sister-in-laws house so that we could visit and the cousins could play together. We finished the drive to my in-laws house and spent the weekend with them. The children had a great visit with their grandparents and got to see a lot of family members. We also made a trip to the zoo which they loved! After spending a few days with my in-laws, we drove another 6 hours to visit my mom and family members. My sister in law had her baby that day but unfortunately missed the chance to meet him! Upon arriving to my mothers house, I broke the news to my mom that we were expecting another child. She was very surprised and excited to hear the news that she was getting another grand-baby! We ate dinner with my mom and my aunt that evening. My oldest sister works at an OB/GYN doctors office, so the next morning we all surprised her at work with my children wearing \"big-brother\" and \"big-sister\" shirts and her reaction was priceless that we were expecting again! We live very far away from our families, so it was great to be able to tell our families in person and see their reactions to our news. We were able to spend a whole day with my sister and my niece and nephew and we went to the playground and ate pizza and ice cream. The cousins had such a great time together. We also had the opportunity to go to a nice children's museum and visit with other family members we had not seen in a very long time. After our time in my hometown, my mom and the kids and I drove down to visit my sister and her husband. We had such a great time, but half of us got a stomach bug putting a damper on parts of our weekend. My sister and I were able to get some time together and go to a concert of our favorite band while my mom stayed home with the kids. We visited another children's museum, ate more ice cream, went to a parade and overall had a fantastic few days visiting. Then my mom and I finished the trip back home, she spent the night at our house, and she flew back home the next day."
