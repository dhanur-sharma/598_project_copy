        "Summarize the following story in first person: The type of job that I currently do is data entry. It becomes very mundane and boring looking at the same screen and typing in similar material. 12 weeks ago, a new job opened up that seemed interesting. It is a far cry from what I am doing. There is more interactions and less of the same old thing going on. I was nervous about the interview process because it has been a long time that I have interviewed for anything. I was a little shy, which was strange because these are my co-workers, and a little unsure of myself. However, I carried on the best way I knew how. I tried to sound confident without coming across like a know-it-all. I made mention how much I like to work at the company and how I am ready and willing for a new role and that I will not let them down. This new opportunity has me excited. It comes with a slightly higher pay and new daily tasks that won't end up boring me to tears. Some of the people hinted since I have been with the company for a long time that I will mostly be given a more thorough look at. It is time to start a new chapter in my life and prove to others that I am a Jill of all trades. I am a quick learner and know I can pick up this new role within a couple of days."
