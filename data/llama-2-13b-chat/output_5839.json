        "Summarize the following story in first person: About five months ago, I decided to become a court appointed special advocate. CASA for short. I really love children, and with my background in pediatric nursing, I thought I would do a good job representing the abused and unloved ones in court. Well, as it happens, I did too good a job. My first child to represent was a four year old girl who had been physically abused by her drug addicted parents. My heart went out to this beautiful child, and I just resented her parents so much. I really bonded with her when we were meeting prior to the court date. Even though she is only four, I really could feel her emotional pain and despair from being raised by parents who loved drugs more than her. I spoke for her at the custody trial in which I was attempting to get her away from her parents and into foster care. I guess I really was able to let the judge understand the girl's despair and unending pain she suffers in her home, because the judge did take the child away from her parents. He granted custody to me. The judge said that it was clear the child had emotional and behavioral issues, and also clear that she had formed a strong bond with me. I was to be her foster parent. I was in total shock. I am glad to be an advocate, but honestly just want to focus on my career, and have no intention of having children right now. I guess God has other plans, though, because the girl went home with me that day after court. She and I have been living together for about 3 months now, and I am loving every minute of it. Every day, I feel like I learn something new about being a parent and a friend. I am able to see this child blossom into a beautiful healthy, well adjusted child, and I know I am the reason for that. I have found that I love her more than I thought I could, and she is really the one that has saved me."
