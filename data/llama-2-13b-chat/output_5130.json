        "Summarize the following story in first person: A couple of months ago I tried to date a girl. But it turned out that her parents did not like her son-in-law and over time the girl and I met. We both share good and happy moments. Together that led us to fall in love. When I decided to go to his house to ask for his hand, his father humiliated me for being from a Venezuelan family. Later he sent his daughter to study in another state to get her away from me. I still have contact through social networks but. Unfortunately, your parents will never accept me and I prefer not to cause problems in your life. Since then I have been depressed because that has caused me psychological trauma. I definitely do not wish anyone anything because it makes you feel like the worst of the worst. It makes you feel bad enough. My family has tried to help me and I have gradually overcome the problem. I decided to start studying a career and now I'm doing better. The loss of this love affected me a lot and so far I do not understand why discrimination. I think that should end. Things for migrants should be different. It's time."
