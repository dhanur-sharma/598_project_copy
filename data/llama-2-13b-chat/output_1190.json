        "Summarize the following story in first person: A few weeks ago, I went to dinner with my boyfriend and my best friend.  I'd known my best friend since we were pre teens, and this was the first time they had met.  It went really well! I'd been dating him for nearly a year, and it'd taken quite some time for our schedules to line up. I think this delay in meeting gave me some pent up anxiety about it finally happening. My friend texted me asking if I'd like to get dinner, and I let her know that I was with my boyfriend at the time.  We got burgers and wings at a place nearby.  The food was great, but the company was better.  We ended up seeing a couple people that my friend and I knew.  When we finished eating, we spent some time speaking to them. It was nice to catch up with old friends. Afterwards, we went back to my friends house, where my boyfriend fell in love with her dog. Seeing them interact was adorable, since my dog is a senior and doesn't quite play as much.  It was great to spend time with two people I value and care about, and to see them getting along so well. I'm looking forward to spending more time with the two of them in the future."
