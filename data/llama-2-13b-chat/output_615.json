        "Summarize the following story in first person: I had always wondered if she truly cared when she heard the diagnosis last year.  My mother and brother in law were not close, but the relationship might have been worse than I thought.  I recall my mother talking about doing certain things with my sisters husband when we first heard of the cancer, including going on a long trip together and spending more time together during the holidays.  Her plans with my brother in law gave me the impression that she really wanted to get to know him as a person, and try to relate with him on some level with the time they had left.  I was hoping the soured relationship between my sister and mother would not have interfered wit the plans they had, but that might have been the sole reason for the fall out.\tMy sister was a rebellious child in her teens, which is where the negative tension between her and my mother started.  This tension carried on throughout their lives, and it all came to a head when my sister married Mark.  My brother in law was a good man, however my mother did not agree with his atheist views, as she had been very religious her entire life.  I feel that my mother resented him for influencing my sisters religious views, which had become non existent over the past few years.  She stopped going to church and stopped showing up for family dinners on the holidays, which was something we did normally at least once a month.  The older you get, the more difficult it becomes to release grudges and judgments towards people.  My mother was open minded to listening what Mark believed in and why he did not believe in god, however those intentions faded as Mark\u2019s situation got worse.  After finding out he had cancer, his attitude towards life began to change, and my mother sensed this.  She decided she did not want to be part of the negativity that surrounded my sisters family at the time, and felt it would have impacted her own religious beliefs.  \tI understand why my mother distanced herself from the situation due to her relationship with god, however, life is short and I feel she regrets not visiting my sister and her husband before his death.  My mother put god before her family and has expressed to me she does feel guilty for not visiting Mark, but told me she could not sacrifice her life long commitment to Christianity.  Sometimes in life if we are going to be better people, we have to make sacrifices for others even if they make us feel uncomfortable."
