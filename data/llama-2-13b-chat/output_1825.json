        "Summarize the following story in first person: I had a 14 year old male Chihuahua named Petey. Petey was my best friend. We had been through a lot together, and I loved him with all of my heart. On June 13th I knew it was time to let him go. He had been sick for a number of months; and although I had taken him to the vets numerous times and tried many medications, he was just becoming sicker and weaker. On the morning of June 13th, 2019 Petey and I made our last trip together. Before going to the vet's I gave him something to make him relaxed so he would not be anxious. I did not want him to be afraid. I wanted the end to be as peaceful as possible. When we arrived at the vets Petey was given a shot to make him go into a deep sleep. I held him the entire time and told him how much I loved him and what a great dog he had been. The tears would not stop. The vet came back when Petey was deep in sleep. She administered the shot that would make his heart stop, and I felt that my heart would break from the sheer pain of having to let him go. Although I knew that what was happening was the right thing to do, I could not stop feeling that I could have done more. I knew that Petey was at peace. but the thought of never seeing him again was unbearable for me. I left the office without him and started my long period of mourning."
