        "Summarize the following story in first person: About a month ago, I had a problem with someone I cared for a lot. We were in a relationship, and everything was going great. We decided to go out and have drinks at a bar. We came home to my house, and we continued to drink. Out of nowhere, he became verbally abusive and very loud towards me. This was definitely very surprising, and I didn't expect it. We'd never had an argument even before this. He was just shouting. I was very scared, and I didn't know what to do. It made me feel angry, scared, and anxious. He didn't get physical, but it felt like he might. After a while, he did calm down. Still, I asked him and demanded him to leave. It was very obvious that he had a drinking problem, since this was the first time I've seen him drunk. Shortly after, I broke off the relationship. I just could not believe it."
