        "Summarize the following story in first person: 2 months ago I was awakened by a terrible crashing noise coming from outside the house. I got up out of bed and rushed outside to see what had happened. When I opened the door I saw a blue truck had slammed into the guardrail that is in front of my house. I ran over to see if everyone was alright and as i got there I noticed that the driver was a man holding a beer in his hand. I was kind of shocked. He was just sitting there, kind of in disbelief, I would guess. I yelled over to him if he was okay and he responded \"I think so. My truck is a mess, though.\" I agreed with him and then proceeded to call 911. I told the operator what happened and I waited for the authorities to arrive. The police and ambulance arrived about five minutes after i called them and the driver started to get out of his truck. He stumbled around the front of the truck and lost his footing and slid down the embankment into my front yard. he came to a stop with a beer in in his hand still. The officer looked over at me with a look of disbelief. I couldn't help but let out a giggle. The officer went over and started to do a field sobriety test on the driver. I went back inside and watched as the man failed his sobriety test and the officer handcuffed him and put him in his squad car.  The tow truck came and towed the truck away and by morning, the guardrail was repaired and it was like nothing had ever happened, except the man had finally dropped his beer can and it was laying in my front yard."
