        "Summarize the following story in first person: So about two weeks ago I went to my best friend's house on my birthday,  a few of our other mutual friends were there and can you believe not one of them said happy birthday to me. I really just couldn't believe it, I'm always there for all of them on their birthdays even buying most of them gifts and they couldn't even remember or even shoot me a simple happy birthday, I was just truly crushed. I didn't stay for that long because I'm so annoyed so after about an hour I left, none of them ever remembering still! I started driving home, I drove around for a little while just really annoyed and kind of let down. I stopped and got a coffee and sat in the parking lot with my coffee alone, by the time I got home it was around 8 p.m.. I parked the car Got to the front step of my door  I started the fumble with my purse trying to find my keys. finally I found them and let myself in, first thing I noticed was It was kind of dark, I always leave a lamp on when I leave the house and this time it was off. All of a sudden Lights came on and everybody screamed surprised!!  there must have been about 30 people shove into my apartment, it was a surprise birthday party, and my best friend's didn't forget about my birthday. I was so surprised and so happy at the same time I hugged my girlfriends and made my way around the room to see who was there. it was such a good party, there were balloons and a cake and gifts, lots of gifts. they even had food and my favorite wine. it was a great night, we hung out and danced all night long. after all the guests left my best friend stayed and cleaned up the mess with me. I'm really glad that I never got mad but none of them remembered it was my birthday when I was at her apartment earlier in the day, I had no idea that they were planning all of this, she told me that they were planning it for the last month and I have no idea.  all in all it was a great birthday I could not have been happier. After that day I really learned to appreciate my friends more, no one has ever done anything like that for me. I guess I owe them on their birthdays!!"
