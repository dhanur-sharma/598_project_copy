        "Summarize the following story in first person: A month ago I was let go from my job without a heads up or a warning of any kind. I was so shocked and did absolutely nothing wrong to deserve losing my job. At the time I worked as a customer service representative in a call center for a utility company. I was responsible for taking phone calls and helping customers out by turning on their power, turning off their power, reviewing their bills and answering other questions that they might have about their bill. I also transferred them to other departments if I was not able to help them. I was also considered a supervisor and helped others that needed it on the fly. One day I was working and noticed that people were being called into the office and they did not return. There was a person from human resources boxing up their items from their desks. After lunch I was called into the human resources office. They explained to me that I was being let go but could not tell me why. I refused to sign the paperwork for being fired. They then escorted me outside of the building and handed me a box of my belongings. I talked with others that was fired that same day and day they let everyone go to budget cuts. It was only an assumption but it should not of happened the way that it did- with no explanation!  I went home and ate my emotions away."

I had to go back and sign the paperwork. I was so upset because I did not deserve to be treated like that. I was very good at my job and was well liked by the customers and my co-workers. I was very passionate about my job and did not deserve to be let go without a reason. I am still looking for a job and am very discouraged. I hope that something good comes my way soon."
