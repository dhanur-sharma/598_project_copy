        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last Wednesday, I went to see the band Kero Kero Bonito perform at the Union Transfer concert venue in Philadelphia, PA. During their performance, I found myself singing along to all of their songs and dancing with other members of the crowd. While I did not know anyone else in the crowd, I felt a oneness with them, as we were all fans of the band and knew all of the songs by heart. I had had two beers before the concert, but the euphoria I felt while dancing with other fans was a different sort of intoxication that did not require alcohol at all. We jumped, sang our lungs out, and stepped back and forth frantically. When the singer needed us to clap, stomp, or carry the tune, we obliged. The night passed by in a flash as our adrenaline and sweat flowed like water. It was the most fun I had had in a while. I had sung and shouted so much that my voice was gone the next morning. It made me think about seeing another band at that venue in the near future. This was the closest thing to a religious experience that I had had happen to me. Short of converting to a religion, another event like this was my best shot at feeling it again. I will always remember this night as one where I joined with complete strangers to appreciate our favorite band. As we walked out into the lobby, we lined up to buy band merchandise. While I didn't really need to buy anything, I wanted to get a shirt or a CD to commemorate the night we had. I bought a signed CD and a sweatshirt before walking out into the brisk fall night."
