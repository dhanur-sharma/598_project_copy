        "Summarize the following story in first person: I finished a book I have been reading for the last few days.  It was a western which is outside of my normal book choices.  It was titled \"Lonesome Dove\" and was written by Larry McMurtry.   \"Lonesome Dove\" is the name of a near ghost town in south Texas.  The two main characters are Gus and McCall.  They are aging ex-Texas Rangers that decide to go on one last adventure.  They decide to steal some cattle from Mexico and start a ranch in the northern U.S.  I think it as Montana.  The book had very rich character development.  There were good guys, bad guys, and in-between guys.  On of the major villains is the a really bad guy name \"Blue Duck\".  One of the in-between is a girl/woman named Lori.  She is a \"lady of the night\" but sweet just the same.  Gus and McCall are kind of the good guys.  The scenery and imagery are very rich.  It is very colorful in terms of the language.  You need to remember this book and maybe get other books written by McMurtry.  I really miss this book -- it seemed like an old friend."
