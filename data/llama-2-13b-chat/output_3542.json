        "Summarize the following story in first person: My sweet daughter lost her little girl several months ago. She was 7 months along when the doctor lost the heartbeat. We met her at the hospital  where she was induced. About 4 hours later her little baby was born. It was really hard, we cried and prayed together. Her faith has helped her get through it. She and her husband are being strong for each other and their other two kids. She understands that faith in God makes hard things possible. She wrote us about it and quoted this from one of our church leaders: This is a vivid illustration of the truth expressed by President Russell M. Nelson: \u201cWhen the focus of our lives is on \u2026 Jesus Christ and His gospel, we can feel joy regardless of what is happening\ufeff\u2014or not happening\ufeff\u2014in our lives. Joy comes from and because of Him.\" She has helped us through this as much as we have helped her. She has reminded us that everyone\u2019s situation is different, and the details of each life are unique. Nevertheless, I have learned that there is something that would take away the bitterness that may come into our lives. There is one thing we can do to make life sweeter, more joyful, even glorious. We can be grateful! We are trying to live that way."
