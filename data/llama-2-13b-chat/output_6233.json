        "Summarize the following story in first person: I will write of a recent event that happened last month. The event is about my journey in Colombia, Latin America. It involved me directly since I was the one who traveled. The event was emotional and touching because it involved the beautiful landscape and wonderful people of Colombia. The event was memorable because it was a personal challenge for me. My journey was marking because it was a milestone for me. It also was striking because I would never forget the challenges of my journey. The journey was long and involved. It took many hours of flying to Colombia. It involved airport transfers and long delays. The layovers were also long. The journey included traveling by plane and buses. The roads I have travelled were not in a good shape. The schedules between the busses were not convenient.  And the bus travel time was very long between the bus stops. But the natural beauty of Colombian landscape made up for a lot of challenges on the way. It was rewarding to arrive in a strange destination."

The food was delicious and the people were very friendly. They were eager to help and show me around. The language barrier was a bit challenging. But I managed to communicate with the locals. I learned some basic Spanish phrases to help me get around. I saw many beautiful places in Colombia. I visited the famous coffee plantations and the historic city of Cartagena. The beaches were stunning. The city was vibrant and full of life. The people were full of energy and passion. The music and dance were infectious. I was moved by the beauty of the place and the warmth of the people. I was glad I overcame my fears and took the journey. The challenges I faced were worth it. The experience was life-changing. I would definitely go back to Colombia again."
