        "Summarize the following story in first person: My girlfriend and I moved recently. We had been dealing with financial difficulties in our previous house. We were always pretty poor; I had a low paying job and she was unemployed, but it wasn't a problem before. The biggest issue was that we always had roommates before, but then they moved out. We could have potentially gotten replacements, but the house was so old and run down that nobody seemed very interested. The landlord wasn't very responsive and to make things worse, some squatters had been nextdoor for several months already. At a certain point, I no longer had enough money for rent payments. It was a very stressful time in both of our lives. Through some stroke of luck, one of the members of my girlfriend's church was looking for new roommates; someone that was friendly and we could trust. Thankfully, they trusted us as well, since we still didn't have the income to pay rent, but were looking for work. We started packing and got ready to leave that old house behind. I still hurt when I think about that old place; we had a big back yard with a beautiful garden and it was fairly peaceful until the squatters were there, but those times are lost to the past now. It took nearly a month to get everything out of there; we had made our lives there together for about 3 years and I had lived there for 6 years before; most of my adult life. Thankfully we were able to get help moving boxes. I don't know how we managed to get everything stored away here, but somehow my girlfriend found a way. She can do anything when she puts her mind to it. We've been here for 3 months now and it's starting to feel like home, but there's still things to get used to. We live with 2 other people and have to share a bathroom, which is pretty annoying, but I guess it's okay. It almost feels like I'm going through a haze, still, but we keep on going. My girlfriend has a job now and I'm bringing in small amounts, still. Sometimes it feels like we're struggling to make ends meet, but I guess that's life."
