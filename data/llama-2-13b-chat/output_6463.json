        "Summarize the following story in first person: Two months ago, I was really struggling financially. I am the sole provider in my household. I do not make all that much money. My job is about an hour and a half away in walking distance. For the entire year, I walked to and from the workplace because taxis would eliminate all of my profits from that day. I wanted to pick up extra shifts, but the walking destroyed my energy. I started to save up for a car. I was quickly beginning to realize that I was unable to save any decent amount of money up because too many bills kept piling up. I then got the flu and I had to miss an entire week of work, which only made matters worse. After I got better, I returned to work, but I was already way behind on my finances. There was no overtime available to me, either. I asked my stepfather for help looking for a car back in June of this year. He agreed to do so, but I told him that I was on a really tight budget. He then contacted me and told me that he had found a car. The memorable moment was this: He gave me the car for free! I did not expect it. He told me that he had seen how hard I was trying and he just wanted to help me out. I am forever thankful to him and I even offered to repay him, which he refused to accept."
