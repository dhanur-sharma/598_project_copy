        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last month I ws offered a new job with an amazing salary.  This was memorable to me because I had been looking for a long time.  About one whole year to be exact.  I was not happy with the salary at the job I was working the last two years and just decided to finally do something about it.  I started applying and interviewing heavily looking for that perfect opportunity. I reached out and worked with recruiters and headhunters.  I wasnt shy about waht I wanted and I was offered many jobs over the course of the year but held out for the perfect offer.  It finally came and I was ecstatic. It was everythig I hoped for ande even a little bit more.  It only had one downside and that was that we would have to relocate away from our friends.  I feel like this is okay though because we have family in that area and will have supprt when we need it.  I am excited to start which will be in this upcoming week.  We are so happy and ready to begin our new chapter in our life.  The kids are happy,  The wife is happy.  I am happy.  We should all thrive in this new environment."
