        "Summarize the following story in first person: I still can't quite believe it! A week ago I completed my Master's in Accounting. After so many years of work beginning with my Bachelor's it finally happened. When I began this journey I had no idea how much work it would take and perhaps if I had known I may have followed another path, so I'm thankful that I didn't because it feels great to have made this accomplishment. I felt so proud when I received my diploma. It was such a thrill! I couldn't stop smiling. One thing I have to admit is I have been taken aback a bit by a feeling of almost loss. This...struggle has become almost a part of my identity and after finishing all this I feel almost as if I have lost a piece of myself. I find myself wondering what to do next. Having that single-minded focus for such a long time creates such a tunnel vision as to what comes after it has been a bit of an unexpected challenge emotionally. I'm trying to give myself time though. It's only been a week after all! That's not to say that I don't feel any sense of excitement about the future. Surely many opportunities have opened up to me with this achievement so I look forward to seeing what the next chapter of my life will be. I guess I go back and forth between these two feelings - loss and excitement. It's a little weird I guess."
