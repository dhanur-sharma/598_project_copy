        "Summarize the following story in first person: I saw my 15 year-old niece with my brother and his wife during the last Labor Day weekend.  She had finished her first year of high school, and was starting her second.  She had changed quite a bit since I had last seen her earlier in the year.  She stood up straighter when she walked, and was more serious, in her face and the way she talked.  She seemed much more like a young adult than the child I had known for so many years.  She had her cellphone, and used it adeptly, like it was never difficult to learn.  She spoke more slowly and more eloquently, and I was able to have conversations about more serious topics with her.  As I talked to her that day, I wondered what she would be like as a 25 year-old adult in 10 years.  I wondered what her career would be, and if she would be married by that age.  I had always liked her as I watched her grow up and change, but this time was different.  For the first time, she was someone I could talk to as a young friend, not just a silly little girl with a short attention span.  I looked forward to hearing her stories about high school and college in the years to come.  I didn't just feel the love that I always felt, but this time I felt respect for the young woman growing up before my eyes.  I also wondered how she perceived me, this middle-aged man that she saw every few months, without really knowing much about him.  Unfortunately, there was also an unexpected change that I did not see coming, one that bothered me and made me uncomfortable.  For the first time, maybe because of my height and deep voice, I sensed that she was afraid of me, something that I never wanted to happen."
