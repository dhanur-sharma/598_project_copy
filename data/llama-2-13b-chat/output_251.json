She was later adopted. The other was given to a friend. Today I still don\u2019t know what became of the one was adopted. The other is in a happy home with a friend. Oh Christmas night she posted a video of home. He looks fat and happy as ever. It\u2019s bitter sweet . I miss them gravely. I\u2019m also happy that they are in good hands with a family that will love , shelter , and but it\u2019s them. Like I stated earlier I really think I\u2019m done with animals. I can\u2019t deal with the heartbreak anymore . I will still love them. But only from afar. I hope I ceobvyed my feelings . This was hard  very hard."
