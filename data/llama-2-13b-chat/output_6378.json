        "Summarize the following story in first person: My mother in law seems determined to totally immerse herself in my business. It didn't happen in stages, but all at once. She's overwhelming me with her attention. I sometimes wonder if she has anything else to do or am I not just the number one item on her agenda, but maybe the only thing on her agenda. Her latest invasion into my life was cupcakes. What could be more innocuous than a cupcake, you ask? Well, in the hands of my mother in law, a cupcake is just another weapon in her arsenal. Last week, I made the mistake of complimenting her on a batch of cupcakes she brought to a family gathering. And she responded by promising to make me some and to show me how they were made. Sounds innocent enough, doesn't it?  Well, not in the hands of a woman who seems determined to show me that she's Super Woman!  Or maybe more like Wonder Woman? Anyway, we got together a few times last week and baked a few batches together. All right so far, right? And then on the final day of practice, when we were going to bake a final batch, she 'surprised' me by presenting me with cupcakes she had baked and decorated on her own. The batch was covered with glitter and sparkles and looked nothing like the cupcakes we had practiced making. They looked, to me, gaudy and not very appetizing. I have no idea what the entire exercise was about. Is she trying to be my best friend? Or, more probably likely, is she out to compete with me on any level she can find, even to the extent of 'outcupcaking' me?? Stay tuned. More MIL stories to follow, of that I'm sure!"
