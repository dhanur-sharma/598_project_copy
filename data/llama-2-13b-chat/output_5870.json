        "Summarize the following story in first person: My friend was passed 2 months ago. I don't know what was the cause of death but what i found out was that he died in his sleep and his mother and father found out and called the school and his close friends. I will miss very much and all i can remember is him smiling whenever i did something stupid. I saw him smile when he was with his girlfriend. I just remember him being one of the happiest people when he talked about his girlfriend,if something great happened to his family or him. Now it is just not one of those times and myself, his family, and so many others will miss him. From surprising him and reuniting with him after all those years. I'm just thankful that even though our friendship was largely online , he didn't care for distance or boarders. Once i was his friend i would always be his friend. Adaptability is one of those things that humans can be good at. It will be hard , but i know that you will adapt. Kinda feels like our friendship was too good to be true. I feel like the world is all wrong without him in it. We have talked about death and we have accepted that no one can live forever. But i did not expect that it would happen so soon. We have talked about getting old together, that our friendship will be as strong as ever. Fly high man, you won't be forgotten for all the amazing times everyone had with you."
