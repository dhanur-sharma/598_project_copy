        "Summarize the following story in first person: A recent memory of mine that was very memorable was me losing my dog. I lost him about 3 months ago. I have had him since I was 11 years old and I am 23 years old now. He was my best friend. So without getting into too many details he got into an accident with another dog. He seemed to by okay after it. We cleaned him up and checked for any bites that needed to be taken care of. Nothing major was found by my family and even my oldest brother who happens to be a veterinarian technician. But to make sure he gets better my brother gives us a list of medications to buy. We go get the medication the next day and begin giving it to. He still seems relatively ok at this point in time. We thought maybe he was just a bit tired which was thought to have been because of the accident. We knew it would take a couple of days so we wait. A couple of days later we see he isn't getting better. And his symptoms are getting worse. We take him to the vet and we get the news. He is really not doing well even with the medicine. The infection was getting worse. And because of his age our really option is to put him to sleep. We end up doing that and I watch as my best friend passes away. I still miss him and wished it never happened. I felt he still had a good couple of years of love to give me and my family."
