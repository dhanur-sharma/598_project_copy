        "Summarize the following story in first person: 1 month ago, I had one of the happiest days of my life knowing I will be a father soon. My wife finally revealed to me that she\u2019s pregnant with our first baby by giving me a pregnancy test that proves she\u2019s positive. How she did it? She asked me to take her out for dinner on a fancy restaurant and then she gave me a gift box with a bow on top of it and when I opened it, there\u2019s the pt! I\u2019m planning to surprise her with maternity dresses and baby stuff. As a soon to be \u201cdad\u201d I did a research about healthy pregnancy and parenting. After that day, we decided to tell our families that we are having a baby soon. Me and my wife started to think of baby names. Just because it\u2019s our first baby, I made a design plan for our baby\u2019s room. That is like the last piece of the puzzle I think because that little bundle of joy just completed not only me but our family. I enjoy the first month of my wife\u2019s pregnancy because I give her extra care that she needs. We go to her doctor and buy her everything her body needs. Even if she has mood swings, I still enjoy it because I know it\u2019s the baby. I love being a husband and a dad. I feel like I can\u2019t wait for what\u2019s ahead.                  -happened 1 month ago"
