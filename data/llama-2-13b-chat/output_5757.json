        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was driving to work. I was tired from working two jobs and going to school.  Out  of no where a train hit me and caused my car to wreck. I do not remember much except being ejected and people yelling where is the body. I sat there stunned but really unhurt. I went to work that night because i work in a hospital trauma facility. I was glad to be alive. it made me think I need to never take life for granted. i was always looking ahead. It is true what they say. If you don't stop and look around once in a while you will miss it.  This was a changing point in my life. No longer will I take this for granted. I will spend time with family. I will volunteer and make a difference.  Life is a gift and is short. i should not have lived. My car was totaled the seats bent in half. Anyone else would have been dead on impact. I am here for a reason. That is for sure. I do not know what that is but I will figure it out and use this time as a gift because  it is. Most people would consider it lucky to be alive. I consider it a wake up call to get my life moving and I will do that."
