        "Summarize the following story in first person: Jenni and DJ bought a house together, so Jenni put her house up for sale. That meant I had to move. It was very difficult to find a new place to live. I had a very limited budget, and also have a dog.  Rentals are very expensive in the city I live in.  I ended up finding a basement apartment to move into, with room mates living upstairs. I really didn't want room mates, but had to take what I could afford. It has turned out to be ok, even though I do not want room mates. They allowed me to have my dog, and that was very, very important to me.  I was able to find enough people to help me move all of my stuff. It only took about 3 hours to move all of the boxes into the apartment, and a couple days to unpack. It was nice to have a space that has more room than my old space. There is a great yard for my dog, and she loves it. My favorite thing is having my own kitchen, finally. It's nice to be able to cook what I want, whenever I want."
