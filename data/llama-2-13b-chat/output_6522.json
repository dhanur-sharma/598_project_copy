        "Summarize the following story in first person: Boston Fan ExpoAbout two weeks ago I visited Boston to go to the Fan Expo. I love Anime and marvel and DC comics and movies. I have never been to a Fan Expo before and this was my first time. I went with my girlfriend and some of her family. This was a memorable event because this was the first time I had ever been to Boston as well as going to an event like this. Everybody there was dressed up as their favorite characters it was amazing. I even saw someone Dressed up as the Hulk buster iron man uniform. This uniform was big like the actual Hulk buster armor from the movie. I tried to get a picture with him and he told me in a deep voice \u201cexcuse me sir but a little girl was standing in line waiting for a picture. I looked around and didn't even see her at first. I look down and its this tiny little girl there dressed as wonder woman. So I apologize to the little girl and she says its OK say sir you probably couldn\u2019t see me down here. I felt like that was a good thing that he did standing up and letting me know she was in line I felt like it something a real super hero would do.  This event stuck with me even to this day and it was very emotional to me because the girl resembled and even sounded like my little sister who passed away 3 years ago because she got hit by a drunk driver.  Just seeing that little girl brought so many good memories back of my sister."
