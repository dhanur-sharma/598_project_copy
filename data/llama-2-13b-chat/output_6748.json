I decided to cook the sausages in the microwave. I toasted the English muffins in the toaster. I cooked the eggs in my egg cooker. We had an assortment of Grape and Strawberry Jams. Everyone enjoyed the breakfast sandwiches. I also had a cup of coffee.  After breakfast we decided to relax for a moment and catch up. Later that morning we sat down and watched a move. After the movie we will all decide on what to do next. We called my older daughter in California. We spoke to our grand daughter with great enthusiasm. Now I will decide how long to spend om my computer today. After spending some time on MTURK."
