        "Summarize the following story in first person: I hate my roommates so much. Let me tell you what these idiots did this week. We have a small kitchen, like really tiny, and all I ask is that Mary takes care of that room. She has to clean it, make sure dishes are away, etc. I have the bathroom. James has all the other rooms minus the bedrooms. So Mary is sitting on the couch, the kitchen is a mess. I asked if she had seen the kitchen and she said \"Yes.\" I stare at her and said \"WELL?\" she gets pissed off at me for telling her the kitchen looked like shit. Well, it did look like shit! She needed to clean it. She huffs and puffs about it and then gets up and tells me \"If people would help me out every so often, it wouldn't be this bad.\" Are you KIDDING me? She had the nerve to say that! Like this was my fault that the kitchen was a mess? Like it wasn't her responsibility to make sure it is always clean? I had to walk away. Mary always blames people for what she should be doing. It's so childish. Just step up!"
