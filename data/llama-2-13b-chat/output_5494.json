        "Summarize the following story in first person: I am joyfully working about on my day to day job surrounded by friendly people. It is a great place to work as there is opportunity to improve and learn many new computer skills.  However, as I am first starting to learn some new ones I become pretty frustrated since I don't know enough to find a starting place. Then I finally begin just clicking here, clicking there to see what are in the menus and what I can see that it does.  I continue to do this until a few things start to click and make sense. Wow, I am able to make a first accomplishment and create what the program does. I continue to learn new computer programs and expand my learning. Then suddenly one day my department is asked to help write some pages for a website. No one wants to do it so I say, \"I will take on this task.\" Then I needed to learn what I was writing about before I could actually write it. I'm now learning another new skill.  Supervisors are pleased with the work. I continue to create pages and loved the progress. Then I think why couldn't I do this and get paid for it. I'm on to my next venture of creating a few websites for people that never had one so they are pleased to finally be joining the web. There is more learning experiences following this as now I learn to keep writing about subjects I know nothing about."
