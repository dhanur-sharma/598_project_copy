        "Summarize the following story in first person: I spend most of the time at the Island of Bali. I retired last year.  I find winters to be too cold for me in the United States.  After I arrived in Bali, I got a call from my daughter.  She was going to have a baby a few weeks earlier than expected.  I just arrived in Bali the previous month and I had to turn around to be with my daughter.  When I arrived at the Dallas airport, I got a text message from my son-in-law.  It was accompanied by a picture of my granddaughter.  She was my first grandchild.   I was excited but was sad that I was not there when the baby was born.  It was a joy to see the baby.  She was healthy considering she was born earlier than expected.  I felt so blessed.  I felt like I was the luckiest person in the entire world.  I cried and laughed all day long."
