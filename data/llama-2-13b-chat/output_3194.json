        "Summarize the following story in first person: One Sunday this past August, I was taking my dog out to use the bathroom.  I walked him down the stairs to the grass area.  He did his business then I head back up the stairs with him.  As I placed my foot on the top step, my dog suddenly decided he was not finished using the restroom.  I turned around to head back down the stairs but my foot slipped out the top level and I fell sideways on my left arm.  I landed with a thud directly on my arm and wrist.  I lay there for a while stunned and in pain.  My dog looked at me to make sure I was okay.  All I could do was look up at the four steps that I had just fallen down.  I tried to get up and that is when I knew something was wrong.  As soon as I sat up, I felt nauseous and dizzy.  My arm began to hurt tremendously.  I yelled for my husband who was inside eating breakfast but he did not hear me.  I yelled once more and still no response.  After my attempts to get him to come outside, he finally appeared at the door.  He came out and saw me still lying on the hard concrete bleeding from the arm and hand.  I told him to take the dog inside and I delicately made my way to my feet.  I went inside hoping that I had just cut my arm and maybe just pulled a muscle or something.  I tried to deny the fact that my arm needed attention for several hours.  However, when I looked in the mirror I noticed my left arm was bent and I was unable to straighten it.  I could no longer lift in myself.  I had to pick my arm up with my right hand to get it to move.  I told my husband that I thought I needed to got the urgent care.  He took me there and after a short wait and several x-rays, I was told my arm was in fact broken in three places.  What a way to spend a Sunday."
