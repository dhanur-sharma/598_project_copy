        "Summarize the following story in first person: So I met a woman on Tinder about 6 months ago that I just wanted to hang out with; maybe have some sexual relations, but that was about all. We ended up going out to dinner one night and started talking about everything in life. Though the conversation was just casual, I truly felt like the woman was amazing. She knew what she wanted in life and didn't seem like she would stray from her goals. She said that she didn't really want a serious relationship but I could tell as the conversation went on longer that she would be open to a long term relationship. Every time she would speak my heart would start beating harder and harder because everything about her was so attractive. As the night went on I finally asked her about her relationship goals. She let me know that she didn't really want anything long term but being that our evening was going so well, I might be changing her mind. I smiled and continue to talk to her throughout our dinner session. Once we left the restaurant we to a local bar to have a drink and that's when things really got good. She told me that just from spending some time with me that she wanted to be with me. She said she never felt that way after a few hours with someone. I told her that I felt the same way and that maybe we should pursue a relationship. She agreed and we've been together every since. We plan to get married in the next coming year."
