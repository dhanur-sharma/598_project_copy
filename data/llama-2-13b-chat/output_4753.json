        "Summarize the following story in first person: Over a year ago I started having pains in my knee. Not like oh my knee is sore pain, but ouch I don't know if I can walk pain. I tried to tough it out for a few days but it was no use, I had to have it looked at. Getting in to see the doctor was the usual trouble, call to book an appointment, nothing open for a while but finally I did. After a brief examination the diagnosis was clear: I had a knee injury and would need surgery. After a few more doctor visits for examinations, meeting the surgeon, discussing the procedure, the day finally came for the surgery. I went in for knee surgery in January. After being admitted and put in a gown and bed, the last meeting with the doctors took place. At the end of it the anesthesiologist asked a series of questions just as final confirmation. \"Are you allergic to any medications?\" No I replied. \"Do you have sleep apnea or any breathing disorders.\" No I don't I said, thinking that I had already wrote this all in a questionnaire. \"Is there any possibility that you could be pregnant?\" No I am not pregnant I said. \"This is very important though, is there ANY possibility that you could be pregnant?\" Hmm I thought. I didn't feel pregnant, but then again I had never been before, how would I know? So I said \"yes, it's possible I suppose, what does that mean?\" I'll tell you what it means. It means that your knee surgery gets postponed while they administer a pregnancy test. It means they have to do a second test, and then a third one to confirm. It means I went for a simple surgery and instead found out I was 5 months pregnant. It turns out that they couldn't do the surgery when I was pregnant, the danger to the fetus was too great. My surgery was cancelled. After a closer examination of my knee they decided the problem with my knee could wait a few months for surgery, or may even resolve on its own with physiotherapy. But there was one complication of my knee problem that none of us ever expected: I gave birth to my son in May."
