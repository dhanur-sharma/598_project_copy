        "Summarize the following story in first person: Three months ago, myself and two friends were coming home after dinner and drinks at our favorite restaurant. We were driving down the road through the the wooded area when we saw bright lights off in the distance. These lights were so blinding that we had to pull over. We got out to investigate because there are no buildings or facilities in that part of town. Just when we got out we saw a disc shaped object lift off from where the lights were shining. We couldn't believe what we saw and quickly took out our phones to capture the moment. The object kicked up wind as it took to the air but their was an eerie silence emitting from it. It hovered in the air for about thirty seconds before jetting off over the horizon at speeds that don't seem possible. The wind died back down as the UFO left our sight. We all just stood in disbelieve at what we witnessed. We uploaded the video to social media and my friend managed to stream a bit of the ship live on Instagram. The footage garnered so much attention and views from people all around the world. Many people in the comments thought it was a hoax but we told them that it was all real. Eventually the videos were all taken down from all of our pages. It seems some people don't want the truth to come out just yet."
