But all of a sudden it changed. And it felt at if it was going to rain. I was at the left side just in front of a tall building. There was four cars approaching at the junction of the T-road instead of three. Because the junction can only allow three cars intersect at a time. The fourth car was trying to overtake another car. There was a serious chaos among all the cars."
