        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 6 months ago the most important day of my life took place. The man I love proposed to me. We were on a vacation to the Bahamas, we were relaxing under the summer heat, me getting my tanning hours in. The months before had been marked with the stress of family and work, and I just couldn't handle it anymore. I needed a break, and he knew it. But he decided to spice it up a little. As we were sitting in our families' small beachhouse, he got on one knee and proposed to me with the biggest diamond I had ever seen in my life. I almost cried, I couldn't believe this was real. Our wedding is set for September, and I can't wait. When I think about that day, I still get butterflies in my stomach. He had topped a miserable year and redeemed it all in once sentence. I can't wait to spend the rest of our lives together. I'm lucky to have him. I have work to do in terms of wedding planning, though, now. That's very stressful! So It's not all great, but it is worth it."
