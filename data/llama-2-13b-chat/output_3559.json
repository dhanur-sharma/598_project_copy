        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was my best friends birthday party. We both turned 22 and we wanted to celebrate together. He invited all his friends and I brought some of my close friends and we all partied. That night I drank a ton of alcohol. I remember chugging a four loko and drinking a bottle of Hennessy by myself. After that I felt really drunk and was all over the place. I was definitely drunk because I remember being in the bathroom with my friends over the toilet trying to throw up. My girlfriend walked in gave me some bread to eat and I reluctantly accepted. After I ate the bread I threw up in the toilet and couldn't stop after that. I just kept going and going. After I cleaned myself up and went back out to keep partying. My friends were all super drunk and messed up but we all had a good time. I remember getting kicked out my friend's ex girlfriend because my friend was ready to knock out. We were on the street with a couple of my other friends. Before I could leave, I threw up one more time in a trash bag. It was really fun and even though I felt really bad the next morning I would love to do it again."
