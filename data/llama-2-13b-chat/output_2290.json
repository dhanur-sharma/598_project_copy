        "Summarize the following story in first person: As I recall, the most exciting part of that month was the Inkarceration Festival in Ohio. I found myself again at Mansfield, after many years of struggling. Perhaps it was the location, or the people. Perhaps I was just getting over my breakup. All I know is, something wonderful happened there. The music we had practiced over and over this time put me in some sort of introspective trance. I felt like a different person. And that everything was going to be brighter in the future. I suppose everyone has these moments in life. These realizations where they feel that the road has just taken a turn for the better. The guys were there, doing what they normally do: rough housing, talking crap, lighting up to play cards in the back after the concert, or sometimes scouting the crowd for the easiest fan-girl. However, on this trip I felt more connected to them. I felt as though they were beginning to really understand me. Sometimes it would be just a look in the eye, or a nod here and there. Somehow I felt a part of the fold. That festival will always be a highlight of my new road. A masterfully crafted cobblestone compared to the briar-riddled swamp I was trudging through before."
