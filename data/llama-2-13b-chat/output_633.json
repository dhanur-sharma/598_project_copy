        "Summarize the following story in first person: 6 months ago i visited Times Square with my friend saffron. So many things has been changed since then. we both decided to go out on a tour which has a the destinations such as Las Vegas, Texas and Times Square. even though times square was last in our list we decided to go there first as it was somewhat close from our city but have not gone there before. Our trip was set to last for six days by staying two days in each destinations. When we reached Times Square i was completely surprised, stunned or you can even say shocked to see the tall buildings which is ignited with lights. The crowd in Times Square was really amazing everyone one was friendly and caring. We reached times square by 7:45 pm as it was bright I wanted to check out most of the stores in Times Square but Saffron was already tired of travelling so we decided to take a rest that night and start exploring Times Square the next day. We stayed at a small hotel in times Square which we have already booked before the trip. On the very next we both got up early and started to check out all places and didn't even go to the other two destinations as planned. WE spent the entire 6 days on times square where saffron also found her love of her life but only when we were about to leave. When we both came back to home towns our life was completely changed. My friend saffron got married after a month of our trip and settled in New York. Even though i am happy about her its slightly a pain when you are ignored by the very best friend of yours. I always hope she will remember me one day and call but its almost 4 months now i haven't heard from her."
