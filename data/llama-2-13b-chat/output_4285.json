        "Summarize the following story in first person: A couple monthss ago my brother in law and sister in law came down from KY to see us in FL.  We had a great time together.  We went out on our boat and spent the day at the beach and island near our home, enjoying the sun and doing a lot of fishing. At night we went to a local seafood restaurant, and had a great time drinking and listening to music. When we were done with that, we took the kids to the local playground. We played tennis and then played a game of flag football. The last day they were with us, we went out on the boat again. It was really hot - summer in Florida is like that - and the kids wanted to go the the \"sand bar\", a place that boats gather at low tide. There were probably about 100 boats out there that day. Everyone is having a great time, partying and swimming and playing music and just having a great time. The kids were doing dives off of the boat, and then we played football in the water with other people. We sat out on floats and talked about family and old times. It was so fun, hot and relaxing. We had lunch on the boat and the kids continues to swim and play. They really had a lot of fun and are now thinking of buying a boat and keeping it at our house, so they can come down whenever they want and get on the water.  My nieces are going to be graduating soon. When they do, they will sell their house in KY and move to FL. I look forward to having them here. It was a lot of fun having them there and I look forward to them coming back really soon."
