        "Summarize the following story in first person: A few months ago, my life changed forever. It was like any other day at work. We had already spent 8 hours that day preparing and loading everything we needed for the event that night, at a hotel in downtown Dallas, and I remember that afternoon being hot, as usual, but the traffic was unusually heavy. We were in a moving truck, but this one was a rental that none of us had ever used. We arrived about 45 minutes later, through the traffic and construction, to downtown Dallas, and all three of the truck docks were taken, nothing new there. If we didn't arrive half an hour before our load-in time, it was bound to happen, so I convinced a security guard to let us use a side-dock on a street they normally didn't use. The dock was adjacent to a street that was on an incline, and we had about 5 hours to unload everything, move it into place, clean it, and get out before people started pouring in. A few hours passed, so far so good. Then we got to the walls. Our company makes these pre-fab walls that we set-up, drill together and weigh-down with sandbags, and I had installed these a thousand times. My co-worker and I started rolling the cart loaded with about 1,500 lbs of walls to the liftgate, and we accounted for the slope, very cautious as usual. I was between the cart of walls and the street as my co-worker started to lower the liftgate, and as the liftgate reached the ground and I was about to roll the cart off, I felt the cart start to tip. The next thing I knew, everything was on top of me and I felt a sudden flash of pain and adrenaline. I thought I was dead. In what seemed like just a second, the cart tipped over on me, knocked me back, and was lifted off by two of my co-workers. The liftgate on the rental truck we decided to use for the evening had and extra little incline on the end, and paired with incline of the hill we decided to unload on, the extra little five inches of ramp sent the cart over the tipping point. I couldn't move my foot. I looked down and saw it laying unnaturally flat against the pavement and I later found out that the cart had dislocated my foot from my leg and broken two bones. It seemed like forever before the ambulance arrived. All I could think about was my girlfirend since we had a baby on the way and I was the only one working. How would we pay the bills? When the paramedics finally arrived, I was taken to the hospital, and ended up enduring the most excruatiating night of my life. As they set my foot back into place, I was in tears, and even though heavily medicated, could feel it all. I ended up needing three surgeries, complete with metal pins, a giant foot brace, and crutches. The doctors told me I wouldn't be able to walk for at least a year, and that I will probably never fully be able to work again, at least not physical labor."
