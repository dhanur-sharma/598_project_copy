        "Summarize the following story in first person: So three weeks ago, my 18th birthday came and went, just like all my other birthdays. My mom took me out for pizza and gave me a $20 gift card to Ulta. While we were at dinner she kept complaining about Dad and that he doesn't care about me but my heart is telling me differently. She said he doesn't give us any money and that he ran off with some younger women who is like half his age. I know she doesn't make a lot of money and she tries her best to get things for me but we're lucky if we actually have food in the house lately. She has to get her car fixed so she could get to work and that pretty much tapped her out for the next three months. She is a waitress so she said she'll pick up some extra shifts to get more tips to pay things off. I know she is trying her best and I can see why she is mad at Dad because he is supposed to be paying us for support. I just finally had the chance to sit down and write my thoughts as it's been crazy. Well, last week Dad called me and wanted to meet but he didn't want me to tell Mom. So he picked me up after school and we went for some ice cream. I was so nervous and scared as Mom always said mean things about him I didn't know what to expect. The only memory I have of him was when I was like three and he would take me for walks. I haven't seen him since then. He looked differently then I remember and he tried to give me a hug when he picked me up but that made me feel weird. Well, I wanted to write down and remember this day because I got a whole new perspective on my life. Dad sat me down with a chocolate sundae and opened up. He told me he had to leave mom because they were arguing all the time and they just fell out of love. He actually started crying and I felt really bad for him. I really want him back in my life so I gave him a big hug and told him I love him. He said we will work out a way to see each other and he will talk to mom. Since I am 18 Mom doesn't have much say about my life because I am an adult and if I want to see Dad then I will.  I'm feeling so much better about my life right now."
