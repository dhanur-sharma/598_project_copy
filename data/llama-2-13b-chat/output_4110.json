        "Summarize the following story in first person: I couldn't believe what I heard over the phone. I was in utter shock. My friend, who was currently dealing with his own serious issues, could tell something was wrong and asked me \"Everything okay?\". Not wanting to worry him, I told him \"Yeah. Everything's fine.\" I tried to shake off my disbelief and continue being strong from my friend, but my mind began to wander. I quickly thought about every time my girlfriend was dishonest with me. I thought to myself about all the times she seemed to be distant and distracted; either on her phone or staring off in to space. I began to think if I had done something wrong. I couldn't think of anything I had done to make her not want to be with me. I also thought if I were the other man or if her fiance was the other man. I had told my friend prior to taking him to the hospital that I vehemently believed that this woman would be the one for me; my soulmate. I had even picked out a ring for her and had even planned to ask her to marry me this weekend in front of her family. Everything I knew about love and loyalty vanished in front of my eyes as soon as I heard the other voice on the end of the phone tell me this was her fiance. As my mind wandered, my friend read my face and stated \"I know you talked to her.\" I simply nodded and agreed. He said \"I guess it didn't go so well did it?\" I nodded my head and told him what happened. Even in his state, broken leg and all, he consoled me and spoke to me about his own experiences with relationships. He was generally a very reserved person when it came to these matters, so hearing his struggles helped me realize I wasn't alone. It was at this moment, that I realized that my love for this woman had made me blind to so many red flags as well as realize that this friend would be there for me no matter what happened in our lives."
