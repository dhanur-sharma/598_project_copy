        "Summarize the following story in first person: My best friend decided to get married and his wedding was about three months ago, back in May. I never thought he would have got married but I guess I was wrong about that one. I went to get my tux but still couldn't believe the reason I was getting a tux. I just could have never imagined it. The wedding day came and it was one of the most beautiful setups I had ever seen. There were so many combinations of colors and decorations everywhere and his and his wife seemed so happy. The wedding ceremony went as planned and we made our way to the cars to go to the reception. At the reception he asked me to speak, which I did because I know he would do the same for me. I told a few jokes, everyone laughed and we all ate and had good conversations. At the end of the day my best friend and I talked for a while in private and I told him I was proud of him. He motivated me to want to do the same thing one day. I handed him some money and told him to make sure he spends it wisely. He smiled, nodded, and agreed to do so. We went back to the reception (from speaking in private) and helped clean up a little bit. It was a very good day from not only him, but me too."
