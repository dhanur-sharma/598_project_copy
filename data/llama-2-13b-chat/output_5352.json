        "Summarize the following story in first person: A little more than two months ago, my now-girlfriend confessed she was interested in me - it was June 20th, the day before the solstice so an easy date to remember, and not long before her birthday. That makes her zodiac sign the crab and mine the ram, not meant to get along without a lot of work, but we get along fantastic - so much for that. She speaks quite directly, and it's very relaxing and reassuring. Wasn't so direct about that crush for a few months, though. I'd first started talking to her because I admired her art, and she admired my writing - not that you'd know it from this kind of diary entry. Bit more comfortable with fiction I suppose. Anyway, we'd spent a few months chatting online, flirting a bit but ambiguously so, you know, like you could read more or less into it, whichever way you liked. Anyway, we'd both developed massive crushed on each other of the course of chatting - though she's told me since that she'd been pining a bit even before we started talking, that was cute - so it was nice to finally have that stated. Feelings mutual. And it's only been a couple months, and it's a long distance thing, but it's been working unbelievably well since then. All the little things, waking up to texted good-mornings and listening to her voice saying good night every night, chatting while we watch shows together, sorting out travel plans. Really quite remarkable given that she's ridiculously out of my league. Talented, thoughtful, gorgeous, ambitious, much smarter than I am - she's incredible. And somehow she's enjoying spending time with me. Go figure."
