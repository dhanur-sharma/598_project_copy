        "Summarize the following story in first person: Me and my husband woke up one day to an email on his phone that had said \"You have been working hard this past week, I will give you a slight raise on your paycheck.\" It was his boss. When we looked at how much money we had, we had a lot of extra money. We both thought that this was intentional so we decided that the next day we will plan a surprise trip to Las Vegas. We were only going to spend two days there, though I wished it could have been longer. The next day we got there and we checked in to our room at a really nice hotel. We placed our bags down and went off to the strip to go explore. We went into a lot of hotels and gambled for hours. Later that night we tried to gamble more but I could not find any of our money. We had spent it all on gambling all day. We just went back to the room and decided to go to sleep. When we woke up I had remembered I left some extra money in the bags. It was only twenty dollars but it was enough for some good breakfast. After breakfast we had five dollars to spare so we decided to just put it in a slot machine. We thought all hope was gone when we put that money in that we were expecting to lose. But just then we saw all the pictures lining up and we won over a thousand dollars. We were very exited and went to cash it in. We stayed an extra night and got some gourmet food for breakfast lunch and dinner!"
