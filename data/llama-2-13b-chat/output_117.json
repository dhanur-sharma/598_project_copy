        "Summarize the following story in first person: Tonight is March 17th 2019, one of the most worst days of my life. As I was sitting in my room, I happened to glance outside to the parking lot of my building. I looked in the spot where my car was parked and noticed something odd. It looked like someone was in my car. I got up to take a closer look and sure enough, two people were sitting in my car, rummaging through my belongs. Anger took over me, and without thinking, I ran downstairs to confront them. \"Hey, what the hell are you doing in my car? You know I'm a federal officer, and you just broke into my car??\" I said. One of the men replied, \"so?\" I didn't say anything else, I just turned around to walk back to my apartment so I could call the cops. As I'm coming up the stairs, my roommate is coming downstairs. She had seen everything from the bedroom window and came down to see what was going on. I rushed passed her, heading up the stairs, as I ran past her I told her they just broke into my car and I was calling the police. While I'm running up the stairs, I can hear my roommate trash talking the suspects. Telling them to get a job and things like that. I live on the third floor and by the time I got to the bottom of the third floor stairs I heard my roommate yell out \"he just tried to hit me with a bat\" I hurried as fast as I could to get to my apartment. I grabbed the closest weapon I could find, a knife, and headed back downstairs to help my roommate. I ran up to the guys with the bat and one proceeded to swing at me several times. I put my arm up as he tried to swing for my head, and he broke my arm. Eventually the suspects were arrested. I will never forget this day and how much fear and anger I felt, and still feel to this day. I could have lost my life that night but I'm grateful I didn't."
