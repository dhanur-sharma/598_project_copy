        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was dating a widower for 18 months.  He was so great, smart, funny and we had great chemistry.  We did so many fun things and had so many common interests.  There were a few huge problems I had to put up with that were hurting me emotionally and really annoying.  I didn't realize how annoying until we broke up and I didn't have to put up with it anymore.    He was obsessed with his dead wife.  He still had her ashes in the house and posted huge Facebook tributes to her.    He also had a 26 year old daughter that has the maturity of a 12 year old and was constantly calling and texting non stop with a constant barrage of problems and drama.  He catered to her every call and text, and when she knew we were going to go do something together (usually he pretended he was by himself), she would purposely call to ruin it.  She would call and be fake bawling, and I do mean over the top bawling, saying \"I miss mom!!!!\"  and wailing.  It would ruin him and it was like attending an event with a zombie after that because she messed with his head.   She was a theatre major, so I really doubt it was real crying, the mother died 4 years ago.   When she would come to town to visit, he wouldn't even tell me the date she was leaving, text me, see me, call me or even acknowledge my existence.  It was an absolute insult and ridiculous.    I deserve better treatment than that. He would also lie and be secretive about so many things big and small, I got to the point where I couldn't trust anything he was saying because I had know he was lying so many times before.  It was so emotionally hard on me having to be around all that.  I'd give him all the support and positivity I could, but you can only watch someone wallow for so long."
