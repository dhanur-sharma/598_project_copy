        "Summarize the following story in first person: It went really well and you could tell the low income people were really happy here. A lot of them were just really intrigued by the whole process of growing a garden. I really have to say it intrigued me too. I think its nice to come together with people who you assume are different than you are, and realize that no, its not that way at all. You also find out you like similar things. They are low income people, and I even hate that term now, they are just people to me now, and I am just glad we were able to help them. I think it was just something that needed to happen for me to wake up a little bit. Now I really want to do as much as I can to help people, either similar to me or just not in a good spot, like I am for now. This also let me know that I might not always be in good spot, and that there are people out there who could and want to help me. Besides the important thing of helping people who needed it, the whole garden part about it was really nice as well. Now that I know more about that, and how it can bring people together, I am really intrigued by it. Its something that is a process, but at the same time it is also peaceful. I think that is a hobby when it comes to gardening that is something I am going to look into. It made those people happy, and it did me as well.  This was something that I am just glad I got to experience with people who really ended up making me happy in the end as well. I look forward to helping more when I can."
