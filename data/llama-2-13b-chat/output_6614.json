        "Summarize the following story in first person: As the beautiful sky happily accompany with sun rays shining through the football field where the ceremony of my graduation took place. Someone above must have known it was my graduation day and blessed me with a beautiful day. I was so excited that the night before the graduation I could not sleep at all. I tossed and turned all night, thinking about the graduation. I waited this moment for four long years in high school.             Graduation is one of the memorable days of my life. On my graduation, I was filled with butterfly in my stomach. I was like an ant in the crowd waiting to be crushed. The place filled with students and staffs and conversation was excitedly exchange from one friend to another. I wondered around the place looking for my friends who are already laughing excitedly with each other. After searching through the haystack of people, I finally found them. I sneaked on them and suddenly without warning I tapped on one of my friends shoulder and yelled out \"HEY.\" He jumped as if the earthquake has occurred. He turned around and said, \"You scare the hell out of me, man.\" We were all laughing and the conversation began once more. \"So what do we do afterward?\" I said. We started to discuss whether we went out to eat later or we go our separate way. My friends Cong asked me, \"what do you think? Where should we go after?\" I turned to my female friend named Phuong and asked, \"Do you have any plan after this? If not, we should go out and celebrate, what do you think?\" She answered me with no words but a shake of a head, and then she nodded for the two questions I asked. \"Then it's settle, we will go out and celebrate later.\" I yelled \"YEAH.\" Suddenly, everyone started to ran toward the field like lab mice ran back to its cage. We were like an army of bees brushed out of our hive with the common goal. We headed to what we called hogs back an old swimming hole that had a rope tied to a tree. We would swing out and jump into the freezing cold water. It was so memorable because we knew this was our last time together as a group. Nothing in our lives would be the same. Where we go or we meet was undecided but at that moment we had one last chance to have fun as kids."
