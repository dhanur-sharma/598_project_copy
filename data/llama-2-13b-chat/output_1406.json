        "Summarize the following story in first person: About a 3 months ago I had to put my dog of 15 years down because of medical issues.  My dog Tucker was always full of life and one of the happiest dogs you would ever meet - he was sweet, affectionate, and loyal.  This event took place in June during the late evening at my house.  I came home from work and noticed that I wasn't greeted by my trusty companion and knew something was wrong.  I walked around the house searching for him and calling his name but couldn't find him anywhere.  Finally, I looked under the bed and there he was, just laying there, staring at me with a sad face.  I eventually got him out from under the bed and tried to get him to play but he wasn't interested.  I then tried to feed him (normally he's crazy for dinner) but he wasn't the least bit interested in the food.  Tucker was still very affectionate and wanted me to pet him and give him a hug, but he still wasn't himself.  We laid down on the couch and he sat on my lap and watched tv with me for awhile.  Tucker then got up and went into the living room and started making coughing noises.  I came in and saw that he vomited and that there was blood in it.  After that, things escalated rather quickly, and now Tucker was vomiting everywhere and was in severe discomfort.  I decided to take him to an emergency vet that was open 24 hours near my home.  I found out that he has stomach cancer and there wasn't much I could do for him.  After hours of crying and laying in the room with him, the vet gave him some pain medicine to help him be comfortable.  I kissed him and told him he was a good boy and made the decision to end his pain that day."
