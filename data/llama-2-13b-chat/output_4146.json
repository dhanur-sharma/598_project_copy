        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last month I engaged in a project competition at my workplace. The competition had been arranged by the board of directors. The winner was to receive an unknown prize. We were all anxious to see the prize. I was so excited because I had done my research  well. My colleagues and I made a presentation to the board of directors. We were then evaluated and amazingly, my presentation was selected as the best. I was so happy remembering when one of the directors asked a challenging question that I had not expected. I got a promotion from the top rating. I got so excited and happy that I managed to beat all my competitors. I called my family and broke the news. They were all excited and happy for me. My mother arranged a party to celebrate. I invited my friends too. I had fun and everyday I dedicate the promotion to myself and my mum who helped me research.  I am still excited on getting a promotion  because I never expected one."
