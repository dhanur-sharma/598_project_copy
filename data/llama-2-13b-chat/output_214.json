        "Summarize the following story in first person: To start off, I think I completely failed my geometry quiz, which I know I should\u2019ve studied more for...my dad\u2019s not gonna be happy about that. :( Then, we had a pop quiz in history on the reading homework from last night, and I completely forgot most of what I read, which made me even more upset because I actually did the reading! But what really made me mad was the note that Sarah slipped into my locker during passing period. She said she was sad that I\u2019ve been hanging out with Jane more lately and thinks that I don\u2019t want to be her friend anymore. I can\u2019t believe she thinks that, especially after talking with her on the phone for hours and hours last month while she was going through her breakup with Nick! Just because I\u2019ve been hanging out with Jane a little more than usual doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not her friend anymore. She completely blew me off at lunch, and when I told Jane, she thought that Sarah was being a \u201cdrama queen.\u201dThis is just what I need! My parents are getting on my case about doing more extracurricular activities, I have a huge paper due for AP English soon, and I can\u2019t understand a thing in advanced Spanish! The last thing I need is for my best friend to think I hate her and barely text me back anymore.  Uggh! I can\u2019t concentrate on anything right now because of it. I hope she gets over it!!!Sorry I didn\u2019t get to write last night! It was such a busy day, and I was too tired to write anything...I was right about Sarah not being okay. Yesterday, she barely spoke to me, and anything she did say was a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answer.  I tried so hard to get her to cheer up, but of course she just kept saying, \u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Uggh! I wish she would just be honest with me! I\u2019m always honest with her! It\u2019s not fair!Jane also seemed mad all day because she could tell that Sarah was being fake nice to her. I hate being in the middle of all of this. What am I supposed to do? Sarah\u2019s been my friend since forever, and Jane is my new friend, and I don\u2019t want to hurt anyone\u2019s feelings! But I think that Jane is right about Sarah. I think Sarah sometimes gets too dramatic about things. She\u2019s being kind of a brat about all of this, but I don\u2019t want to tell her that to her face, she\u2019d never forgive me."
