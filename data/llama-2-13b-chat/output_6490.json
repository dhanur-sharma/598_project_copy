        "Summarize the following story in first person: I had a memorable experience about two months ago when I got married. I had been looking forward to getting married for a while, as we had been together four years by the time we finally got married. It was enjoyable because I got to share the experience with my family and friends, and it was a beautiful sunny day. I was emotional during the ceremony and was so happy that I could barely stand it. I felt nervous leading up to walking down the isle, but as soon as I got up there and was standing in front of my fiance, I was happy and all of the nervousness left my body. Although some things got messed up throughout the day, there were still more good things than bad. There was a lot of good food to eat and a lot of snacks. It ended up raining not too long after we got done taking pictures, but it only lasted about 10 minutes. It was nice that it rained for a brief period of time because I had heard that it brings good luck, and it also cooled it off a bit. The wedding was outside during the summer, so the break in hot temperatures was refreshing. People ended up staying into the late evening, and I got to talk to family that I don't see that often. I also got to meet more of my husband's family, including his grandmother. She is a nice woman that I enjoyed talking to and getting to know. At the end of the day, I got to relax with my husband and enjoy our first married night together. We both had a great time and I will remember the day for the rest of my life."
