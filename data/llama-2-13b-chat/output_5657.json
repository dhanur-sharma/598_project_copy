        "Summarize the following story in first person: Three things I did this summer are very interesting. I have the opportunity to go to England with the band. The other thing I did was that I joined the Milwaukee Pro Golf Tournament GMO (Milwaukee). I think this is wonderful. The last thing that really stood out in my summer was that I met new people from other countries of the world including Wisconsin and the UK and Germany. First I ran away to England. This is the most exciting experience I have ever experienced. Last summer I wrote a journal travel diary to Europe and after a year I visited these diary entries again. Please remember the ups and downs of trains and planes through Spain and Italy while drinking coffee with important people. I am on the other side of this creature fence, but I know that my expecting wife wants to review pregnancy and learn from the first regression. From various foods to various emotions and triggers of various physical symptoms, by attaching a specific pregnancy diary, the burden can be reduced because the term passed. ter completing my Yellowstone work contract in late September, I drove the spectacular BearTooth Highway and went from there to the Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument. Then from Custer\u2019s Last Stand it was on to Custer, S.D. where I saw the annual Buffalo Roundup. Then I headed to Estes Park, Colorado to see friends I worked with last summer. I finished up at White Sands National Monument in New Mexico and enjoyed sledding down the snow white dunes. Everyone has something to contribute whether it\u2019s with their people skills or just their willingness to do what is needed. But yet, it is not for everyone. It is spending lengths of time away from family and being out of their \u201ccomfort zone\u201d that bothers some people. I am used to living \u201coutside the box\u201d so no TV, spotty or no cell service is not an issue for me. I am blessed to also be in healthy shape to be able to do this and for that I am extremely grateful."
