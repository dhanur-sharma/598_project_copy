        "Summarize the following story in first person: We found a beautiful colonial right in the heart of town. Kids got enrolled in one of the states most prestigious school districts and my spouse landed a much better paying salary working in the same field. Things couldn\u2019t have worked out better for us but I do think about my classic car. It was a sacrifice to exchange for security for my family. We had so many memories with that car being passed down three generations.  although our basic family sedan we own now could never compare to a classic it\u2019s more reliable and I don\u2019t have to worry about expensive body work or repairs. On our 25th wedding anniversary the kids surprised us with the exact model. With the kids out of the house it\u2019s been great spending time customizing it. Now we have the money and time to really enjoy a classic car and not have to worry about upkeep. We take her to road shows and have a special garage made just to showcase. This time around we plan to take as many pictures and have already included her in two family weddings and countless birthdays. It\u2019s important to celebrate what you have when you have it but also know their order of importance in life. People first, places next THEN things. Things come and go. Sometimes for better and never for worse."
