        "Summarize the following story in first person: Three months ago, after deciding he was fed up with the slew of roach/mice issues, run down appliances, and poor communication from the property owners, my boyfriend decided to break the lease for his studio apartment and search for a different apartment in the city. I had long since stopped spending time here - the first sign of bugs was enough for me - and I had to admit the strain of only hanging out at my place (we were not living together) was beginning to wear on us both. His landlord insisted the issues would be brought under control, and he did hire pest control and repairmen; however, it was too little, too late, and my boyfriend broke his lease. He asked for my help one day with looking for a new place. I was happy to oblige, having moved around the city a number of times in the last few years. \"Are you looking for another studio apartment, or do you want to upgrade to a one bedroom?\" I'd asked. He told me it depended. \"On what?\" I asked. \"On you,\" he said, smiling. He asked me to move in with him, the next big step in our relationship. Immediately, I felt a wave of mixed emotions. I was happy and in love, and my mind immediately flashed to happy images of us living together - cooking fancy dinners together, snuggling on the couch, picking out ways to decorate the place. But I was also hesitant - I'd never lived with a significant other before; and on top of that, my sibling had just gone through a horrendous breakup where they had to move out of the apartment they and their partner were sharing, so that was definitely fresh in my mind. What if the same happened to us? We seemed to be building a life that would be near impossible to untangle. I suppose my emotions showed on my face. \"I want us to move to the next step. Isn't that what you want?\" my boyfriend asked me. I told him of course it was, and that I loved him with all my heart; but I wanted to be honest with my feelings, so I also told him I was a little nervous to take such a big step. \"It's what I want too,\" I told him. \"I am scared but I think it just means I care and I'm invested in our relationship.\" We ended up finding a beautiful one bedroom apartment in a historic area of the city. I've never regretted my choice, despite that first flicker of fear. After all, life would be horribly boring without the need to take any risks."
