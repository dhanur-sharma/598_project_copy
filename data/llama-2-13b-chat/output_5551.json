        "Summarize the following story in first person: Going to college was a new and stressful time for me. It was the first time I was on my own, really on my own and I had to make friends and interact with a lot of people which makes me nervous. I've always wanted to just do my own thing while in school, I never liked doing group projects or having to get up and make a speech. In college, all of these issues I have in school, I would have to be doing in order to pass my classes and in order to graduate. The first few years in college were so stressful and hard that I thought about quitting a lot. Luckily, I made some friends and they helped me get through these difficult moments. I wouldn't participate in group projects and would pretend sick all the time and I would never volunteer to make a speech in front of my class or raise my hand to answer questions. I always sat in the back and focused on myself and my own work. The last few years my friends and my family came to my aid many times and without their help, I wouldn't have been able to work in group projects or raise my hand in class. With my friends and my family helping me through the years, they taught me to get passed my fears and go all in. That's exactly what I did, I made myself do uncomfortable things that could get me through my public fears. My friends and family helped me work hard and even tutored me throughout the years. I really didn't think I would be able to conquer these fears I had in college. I felt like they overrun my life and that I would have to seek professional help in order to get through them, which I didn't have the money for. I even told my friends and family how I felt and I told them not to help because there is no way I would get over these fears and I probably wouldn't graduate because these fears held me back. My friends and family eventually talked me into letting them try to help. I didn't think they were helping at first but as the years went on, they never gave up on me and I made sure, since they were taking their time to help me, I would put all my effort into letting them help me and not to give up. I never gave up and they never gave up on me and I was finally able to graduate school because of the help they gave me."
