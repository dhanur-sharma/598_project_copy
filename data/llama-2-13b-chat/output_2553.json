        "Summarize the following story in first person: A few years ago I had found my husband dead hanging from deployment and seven years of therapy and couseling. It was a very bad thing to experience but after many years of being with him for years having to witness some of things that were going on. 3 months ago I was finally able to start finding strategies to cope with PTSD so that I can raise my child in peace and be the mother she deserves. I've been trying to keep a straight head and a clean diet. I feel that helps me understand my self better. I was able to get some counseling in which I think my counselor understand my very well. They knew exactly what me and my husband had went through. So it was easy to speak with them about somethings regarding the situation. We were able to establish communication system one that had me initiate most of the conversations so I would feel more comfortable. Sometimes I would bring my child with me to sessions just to get a boost and feel more confident in what I was doing. My counselor to me to get outside more and that was something I wanted to do everyday. My daughter loved going outside as well so it was a good idea overall. Presently I am doing a lot better than I was a few months ago. I am more level headed and I see a bit more clearly how I can keep things going in the right direction. For me my daughter and my husband."
