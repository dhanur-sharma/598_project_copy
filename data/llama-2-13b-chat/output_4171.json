        "Summarize the following story in first person: We started off our trip with a 9 Hour Drive to Los Angeles from Southeastern Arizona. They say getting there is half the fun, and we definitely try to make this half the fun on this trip. We stopped and saw a few sites, and national parks on the way, and it was beautiful. We had a fun time getting there. We spent the first night at a hotel near Los Angeles. The next morning we got up early and made it to Universal Studios Hollywood. We spent the day in this theme park and it was a lot of fun. My grandkids especially loved all of the Harry Potter stuff. Another highlight was getting to go on the studio tour. Everyone seemed to like getting to see where movies and television were filmed, and experiencing that awesome tram ride. We spent the rest of the day at the park going on all the different rides and all the different lands. My son-in-law really liked going through the walking dead maze. All in all it was really fun that day. Another highlight was after dark when the Harry Potter castle lit up, and they had a show in which the dark forces tried to take it over. It was a really fun day. We spent the next day doing much the same thing in Universal Studios, before driving to Oceanside where we spend another ten days at the beach. The remainder of the trip included a whale watching tour, many days lounging at the beach, and lots of fun with family and friends just enjoying the ocean."
