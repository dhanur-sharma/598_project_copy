        "Summarize the following story in first person: Five months ago, I went one on the best trips I can remember.  I couldn't wait, it was the first time going to Bogota, Colombia.  Before leaving the airport, I had been staying at my Dad's place getting ready for my trip.  His place is closest to the airport so it made the most sense to stay there.  For the next three months, I stayed at a friend of the family's house in Bogota.  Since I was there for three months, I had enough time to visit all the tourist spots.  I went to one of churches right by the house.  The inside of the church was beautiful and the statues took my breath away.  What really blew my mind was the food.  Everything tasted so fresh and the food was amazing.  I went to the local market and they had fresh fish right from the rivers. It was unbelievable.  That night I went home and had fresh grilled fish.  I connected with some friends there and they showed me the non tourist spots. It was really fun I felt like I had a peek into their daily life and wasn't an outsider.  As my trip was winding down and I was due back home, I felt a bit sad to be going back.  However, just as I was leaving I got a notification from one of my friends that showed a collage of pictures from the trip that they posted.  It made me feel much better."
