        "Summarize the following story in first person: An event that was memorable for me within the last 3 months or so was taking a licensing exam for my profession. The test was a multi-day event and had very tight security. It was nerve-wracking studying the day of the exam for the test and in addition getting through security for the exam was annoying. After I got through security I had to wait in a huge room with several hundred other test takers for the exam to start. The proctors read pages and pages of instructions for the exam which was very nerve-wracking as I didn't want to make a simple mistake that could mess up my score on the exam before I even started. Eventually, after what seemed like forever, the exam finally started. The questions were incredibly complicated but I kept going and kept trying my hardest on the exam.  The exam went for several sessions over two days. So before each session I had to listen to many of the same security instructions before each part of the exam. But it slowly got less nerve-wracking as I got used to the exam instructions. During each session though the questions were still incredibly hard. But at the end of each session I was happy because I felt like I had completed another big part of the exam. After the last session of the exam I felt so happy. I actually finished the last session a little early and was able to get out of the exam before a massive crush of everyone else finishing up the exam. It was so liberating to be done with the exam and have more time to do things other than studying and worrying about the exam. I felt great to be done with it."
