        "Summarize the following story in first person: After being together for 7 years David finally proposed to my sister Amber. He knows some of us are skeptical of him and that he is going to have to prove himself. After what happened to Ashley after Tim picked up and left her after all those years, we are all looking out for one another more than before. Amber has the tendency to have her head in the clouds. I know its not nice to say but it is the truth. Sometimes we think David is up to no good and it seems like he might be cheating. They have already been together for a while of course, but they got together very young and people change. I truly wonder if it will work out and I worry for my sister.  That being said, when he proposed he promised endless love.  It sounded genuine and for the first time I actually believed the guy.  It has been a whirlwind lately and I hope what I saw is true.  If it works out for them I will be so happy for my sister.  I think it might be the real deal and the entire message by him was so sweet. I should give him the benefit of the doubt. My sister seems really happy."
