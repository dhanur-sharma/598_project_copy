        "Summarize the following story in first person: I started a company within the past six months and it was a really rewarding experience. It was also difficult and stressful. The most surprising part was that I stuck with it, even with the challenges. I was happy that I was able to stick with my plans in spite of the challenges. Overcoming challenges made the event more memorable to me. I was not able to eat, sleep or have fun, but when I finally succeeded I had a feeling of joy. I was excited that I was able to create something from nothing. I also had a feeling of hope, and I believe that the company will succeed. I also developed a feeling of pride in what I had accomplished. I basically told everyone that I came into contact with about my company, and I had genuine passion for it. I worked extremely hard to accomplish my goal and stayed disciplined. Starting my company was one of the best things that has happened to me in my young life. I believe that starting my own company in spite of the challenges could be inspirational for others. I also believe that the service I provide can help make the world a better place. I have a great sense of accomplishment from what I have been able to do. In the future, I do want to share my background and story with other people."
