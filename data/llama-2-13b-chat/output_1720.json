        "Summarize the following story in first person: We were homeless not too long ago , didn\u2019t have anywhere to go. Went from house to house , shelter , car & outta state. Being out of state was depressing and lonely. But that\u2019s where we had a roof on our heads. Still didn\u2019t have a place to call home though. Recently.. literally like 3 weeks ago we moved back to our home town. We found a house within that first week. We moved in this past Monday and it\u2019s been the happiest we\u2019ve ever been. Only thing is now we have the roof over our heads and no money to take care of everything. I\u2019m hoping everything continues to go good from here and on out we only deserve the best. It\u2019s been a long journey. Scary, sad, happy, confusing and much more. We\u2019ve been through a lot. Hell and back literally. This is our time to shine."
