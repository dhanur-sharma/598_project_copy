        "Summarize the following story in first person: The meaningful event that happened to us in the last six months may seem somewhat strange.  We lost our son when we were pregnant and found out at 21 weeks.  We had no idea prior to that that anything was wrong.  It was the most horrible event that we've been through on so many levels.  It was terrifying and sad.  But, in the aftermath, we were witnesses to a great level of grace that was incredibly meaningful, and continues to be.  We had friends and family take care of us in a way that we'd never experienced before.  We had extended family tell us ways that they grieved through the process, and that helped us feel supported.  We began looking for rainbows after the rain, both literally and figuratively.  Those rainbows are a reminder of color in the dark times of life.  Whenever I see one I feel at peace.  We've been able to talk to and support other people through similar events.  We can't ever understand why we went through what we went through, but we have been blessed to feel so much stronger as a couple and as people because of it. Our faith grew.  We will always carry the gift we will were given."
