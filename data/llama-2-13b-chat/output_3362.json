        "Summarize the following story in first person: I learned this past year the meaning of humanity and kindness in it's truest form. Usually when people say they will be there for you...it's just words.  My current girlfriend who is also my best friend came through in a way no one else ever has. She showed me so much. I was facing a terrible time with an injury. It came out of nowhere. We had only been dating for a short time. She lived out of state and would fly in to visit. In February we planned an outing to celebrate both our birthdays. We made arrangements and had this great week of nature and adventuring planned. Unfortunately due to an emergency medical situation, that all changed. I would have expected her to be upset but she was so understanding. She showed me so much compassion and love. She was so supportive in every way imaginable. Not only did she care for me but she also took care of my dogs after I had emergency surgery. I don't know what I would have done without her in this situation."
