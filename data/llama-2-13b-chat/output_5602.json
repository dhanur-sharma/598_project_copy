        "Summarize the following story in first person: Ever since I went to Ashleys wedding two months ago I have been thinking about marriage. She is 10 years younger than me and married. I am starting to feel like I will be single forever. I mean, marriage has never been important to me. However, ever since I turned 35 it feels like I have no plan for the future. If I don't get married how will I ever afford to buy a house. How will I ever retire. When about when I am old and can't take care of myself and need someone to help me get dressed in the morning. I will wish I had a husband then I am sure. I just can't seem to make any relationships last very long. And I am kind of running out of time to have kids. I am almost at that age where youre considered too old to have healthy children. Some days this is all I think about, and other days I am so happy that I am single and have no one to have to be responsible for. My mother thinks I should stop meeting people off of dating apps and try meeting someone in real life. She thinks that is how I am going to find \"the one\". My problem is I don't even know if I believe that \"the one\" exists. I don't think marriages can ever really work out. I feel like they are more a matter of convenience, to have someone to help pay the bills and raise the children and stuff. I don't know, I think I am really happy being single. I am just afraid I might be single forever."
