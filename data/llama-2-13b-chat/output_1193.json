        "Summarize the following story in first person: A month ago I had to help by babysitting my brother's kids for him and his wife while they were taking care of issues at their business for 2 weeks. Normally one of them is usually home with the kids, but because work required them both to be gone for almost 12 hours a day, I agreed to help them out. I have babysat before for them, so I already was pretty familiar with the kids, who are 3 and 5. They can be busy, but are fun and usually fairly well behaved. I was on winter break from college so my schedule wasn't really too impacted by having to spend every day with my niece and nephew. My girlfriend was able to come over some of the time so that was pretty cool and made it easier. We played a lot of games with the kids, took them to the park often, and found ways to keep busy. I mostly enjoyed the time with the kids, and felt like I got to know them better than I did before. There was one incident where I got a little concerned. Melissa, the 3 year old, was playing with some toys when I heard her brother call from the other room. I went in the room pretty quickly and found him sitting on the floor holding his arm. He had tripped and fallen and landed pretty bad on the arm, and I could see some swelling and bruising already forming. I looked at it more closely and saw he could still move it, but wasn't sure if he needed to go the urgent care. I put some ice on it and got him some Motrin, and called his dad. If I had called is mom she would have gotten more upset I think. My brother told me to send him a picture and then he talked to Brian (his son). We ended up going to the urgent aid as a precaution, but everything turned out just fine thankfully. I learned how to make a few meals in during this time as well. My girlfriend and I experimented with making a few dishes from the recipes my brother and his wife had in their kitchen. I actually enjoyed it a lot, even if some of the meals weren't exactly 5-star. I made some chicken ricotta, pasta salads, salmon, soups, sandwiches, tacos, and more. My girlfriend enjoyed it too, and we talked about our future imagining what living together might be like. Over all, it was a good experience and I was glad to have been able to help out my brother and his wife."
