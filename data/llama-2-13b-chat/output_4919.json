        "Summarize the following story in first person: One nice evening a few weeks ago, my spouse and I went for a walk in land nearby that has trails on it.  We walked through tall grass and along more used pathways underneath trees.  We walked along an avenue of trees that probably used to be a road in the horse and carriage days.  The trees, an unknown type to us, were in full bloom.  The flowers smelled wonderful, and the air was full of buzzing as bees and wasps were busy in the trees.  In a little meadow, there were dragonflies everywhere!  We'd never seen so many dragonflies.  We also saw some ravens playing with a stick in a tree.  While we were watching the ravens, we saw movement, and noticed a deer being very quiet in the brush.  It was a white-tailed deer; a doe.  We were so close to the deer, but since it knew we were no threat, it stayed.  We enjoyed service berries on our walk.  Since it had been such a wet summer, the berry bushes were quite full.  On the way back, a dragonfly landed on my spouse's shoulder, holding a wasp! We really enjoyed the walk in nature, enjoying the animals, scents, and fresh air. It was a really fun time."
