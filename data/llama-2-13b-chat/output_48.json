        "Summarize the following story in first person: All of my years in college have finally been paying off for me, and I feel like I am on course to have a fulfilling career. Throughout all of the hard work and effort, I knew that there would come a time when I would finally be able to have some sort of payoff and be able to enjoy the fruits of my labors, if indirectly. I have always enjoyed spring break and have had a great time, when I could actually take my mind of of coursework and appreciate it for what it was. However, nothing compares to the fantastic concert I attended two months ago, after classes had wrapped up. Me and several of my friends pooled our money together to make it to a music festival that was taking place on a Caribbean island, not far off the coast of Florida. It was simply an incredible time, one of the best memories of my entire life. The quality of the light when you are closer to the equator is just sublime, and the thing that sticks in my mind more than anything else is the sight of the sunrise and sunset during those few days we were there. It felt like stepping into a new world, and I had actually never been anywhere like that even on vacation with my family as a kid. The actual music festival was of course very special, but most of our time was spent on other things. We stayed at a rented place that we pooled our money together for, and it was not all that expensive since there were a few of us in each room. The fishing trip we went on on the second day of our visit was probably the most activity I got the entire time. I didn't feel like working up much of a sweat when I was already soaked in it just the moment I stepped out the front door of our accommodations. The climax of the music festival was something that made me feel like I had goosebumps. One of my favorite electronic musicians was performing and the view of the sunset over the beach as the music built up was just otherworldly. It was not something that I would soon forget, and I think that there will probably be few chances to ever have an experience like this again in the future. One thing I can say is that I met a couple who were very interesting, and we exchanged contact details. So there is a significant chance we may do something together in the future, which is exciting. It is very cool just to talk to random new people you run into in an unfamiliar place."
