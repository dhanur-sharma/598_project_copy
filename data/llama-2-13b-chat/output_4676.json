        "Summarize the following story in first person: This was a birthday party that was supposed to be somewhat of a surprise though I had my suspicions beforehand due to the number of text messages I received from different friends. It was not only the messages themselves that gave it away but the volume of the messages were unusual. I distinctly remember walking in to the door and noticing my chairs being out of place. I knew what was coming but still tried to act surprised as everyone greeted me. I very clearly remember everyone's faces at that instant as they welcomed me to the party. Overall, my friend Steve helped quite a bit in organizing the party. Aside from my family, my childhood friends Raymond and Wei was also there at the party. We had some drinks, snacks and a very delicious fruit cake. I received some very nice gifts and was completely flattered. There was quite a bit of chatter and some catching up with friends that I see less often. Eventually we moved onto playing some games in groups. However, I had a long day at work and was very tired. I could not enjoy that portion of the birthday party to the fullest. Eventually people had to go and I thanked them for coming. I had a very nice long rest after everything."
