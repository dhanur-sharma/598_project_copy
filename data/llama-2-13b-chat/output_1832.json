        "Summarize the following story in first person: Three weeks ago I received a callback about a job offered from a company I anticipated working for. The salary started off at 65,000 within a year, included a raise and promotion included. I was excited about the deal and over the moon about getting. hired. I made sure to prepare myself to raise the chance of acceptance to the company. I've done mock interviews with friends, including recording myself to obverse how I came across. I had nervousness just like anyone else but there were a hint of excitement to keep me afloat.  The day of the interview I went in with confidence  and believed I checked all the right boxes the interviewer is looking for. The person told me they will shortly contact me. I called once a week and there was not a update. I spent almost a month waiting until I finally received a response. I was thanked for my time and my resume was impressive but exactly wasn't who they were seeking. I was bummed out because I met the qualification and beyond for the job.  Ironically I found who got hired and it was a acquaintance I knew who applied around the time I did. Now not only I am bummed out but upset because the person who is now hired was very incompetent and lacked most of the skills. Then I realized they knew the person who referred him to the company. Let's say he got the \"hook up\" on it.  Management said they had hundreds of applicants but only five people they considered. Although it is been weeks, I still wish it could've been me.  Maybe I need to open my mind up of the possibility of landing a better job who hires people with great work ethic and the required skills. it sucks knowing it is not what you know, it is who you know."
