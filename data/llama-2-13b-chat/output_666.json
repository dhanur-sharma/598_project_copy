        "Summarize the following story in first person: I have been trying to have a baby for 5 years.  I have had 2 miscarriages in those 5 years.  I can't explain how devastating it is to think that you will be having a bundle of joy to then lose it.  Going through the process of trying to have a baby after 2 loses is discouraging.  I started thinking that there was something wrong with  me. I started thinking that maybe it would never happen to me.  I started thinking maybe I should just adopt.  After all there are children out there who need parents.  What does it matter if they are my biological children?  I can give my love to a child who needs me.  Then as I as contemplating that scenario I found out I was pregnant!  How excited I was.  I had a uneventful pregnancy and delivery and am now a happy mother to a baby girl.   I know that motherhood brings joy and sometimes worry but I would not change it for the world.  As I am now in the heart of being a mom I realize that it would not have mattered if  I had adopted."
