        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was so excited. It was finally going to happen. After years of marriage, and kids, and bills, and stress, my spouse and I were finally going to be able to just take a week and do whatever we wanted. We hired the babysitter. We took the vacation time off of work. We made all the plans and deposits and everything we needed to have the most fun vacation of all time. And vacation we did. Our destination was cliche, but we went to California, and we went to the beach. Not just one beach, beaches all along the state. We even went as far as the border between California and Oregon. It was beautiful to see such a sight. Some of the beaches were dirty, unkempt, and even downright trashy. But most of the ones we went to were simply beautiful. We collected seashells, took millions of pictures, laid out in the sun, got ice cream, and just did all the fun things we've wanted to do for so many years. I will never forget our California vacation."
