        "Summarize the following story in first person: A few weeks ago, I had dinner with two of my close friends from high school, Victoria and Tammy. We get together about four times a year to catch up and see how we are all doing. Tammy's life is always full of drama and crazy events because of her relationship with her boyfriend Anthony. She caught us up about all of their fighting, issues, and his crazy family. As usual I gave her my opnion on her horrible situation and I explained to her why they are so toxic to each other. After we were done hanging out, Tammy gave Victoria a ride home. On the way, Tammy made comments to Victoria that she hated my input and that is why she did not tell me anything. Fast forward to a few weeks later, I get a call in the middle of the night. It was Tammy and I let it go to voicemail 3 times before finally answering. Anthony got arrested and she needed bail money or the title to my car. In that moment I realized how toxic she is. I began to question so many things about our friendship and her situation. How can someone not want to hear your advice and opnion but still call you for bail money? How does one get into a sitaution where they do not have $500 in their savings? I realized that Tammy is not the type of person I want in my life. If someone is not making your life better then it is better to just go seperate ways."
