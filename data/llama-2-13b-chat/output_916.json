I have worked hard and long for this and finally I can start making head ways! My had started the week after I got the promotion.  I couldn't be happier! I even got to move into a new office. Bye bye, little cubicle! It was weird in a way because I really thought R was next in line for the promotion... but who am I to complain? I couldn't wait to tell my parents! They were happy for me and I can start paying them back as well. That should make them happy even more. I know they don't even expect it and that makes me sweeter. This is just a first step toward my future. I am sure I will stay with this company for some time. At last, things are looking up. Thank you God!"
