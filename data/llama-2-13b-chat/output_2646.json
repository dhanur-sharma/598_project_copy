        "Summarize the following story in first person: This summer I went to San Diego with my friends to celebrate a birthday.  We out to downtown and went out to eat then we went to a couple of bars and we had an amazing time.  We were all pretty drunk but we were still respectful of others and was just having fun.  We are all kind of old to be staying too late and we were all pretty beat so we decided to hit back to our hotel even though the clock hadn't struck midnight yet.  All 8 of us cramped into the hotel elevator including another man in a suit.  Just as the elevator door was beginning to close my drunk friend decided to stick his finger out at the very last moment.  Not surprisingly, the elevator was jammed and we were stuck in there.  The man in the suit yells at my friend for being an idiot and now we were going to spend the rest of New Years Eve stuck in an elevator. We were all miserable.  30 minutes goes by and still no signs of help yet.  Suddenly, I really had to pee, so did another one of my friend.     We couldn't hold it any longer so we decided we had to go but just as we were unzipping our pants, the man in the suit offered a flask with a jalapeno symbol on it for us to pee in, that made us all laugh and it broke the ice.   The firemen eventually shows up and gets us out of there.  The man in the suit turns out to be the owner of the roof club at the top of the hotel so he invited us to come for free and bought us all shots.  It was one of the most memorable experiences because we all as a group turned a situation around.  It could have been a depressing sad night but we ended making the most of it and had one of the most memorable nights together."
