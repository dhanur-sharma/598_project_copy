        "Summarize the following story in first person: The past two months have seemed like a blur, but in the past two weeks, everything seemed to go in slow motion. Leading up to our graduation, every day was jam packed with things to do.  We were cramming for exams, touching up final papers, analyzing data for research projects. And that was just for school. We also had to find time to apply for jobs, so many jobs.  And of course we couldn\u2019t neglect each other. We went out every weekend.  We were finally all 21 and didn\u2019t have to worry about fake ids, so we really took advantage of the full range of bar selections across the city. We felt like we were finally growing up and finally ready to enter the real world. Graduation day two weeks ago was the culmination of all of that.  We partied like we never had before, and we finally didn\u2019t have to stress about waking on time the next day battling a hangover to get to class. After that, though, the dorms closed.  We all had to leave.   I went back to my family\u2019s house for a while, and the whole world seemed to stop.  As adult as I felt the past few months, I was whisked back to childhood by my parents, controlling my every move once again. I still didn\u2019t have a job, but felt like I was running out of places to apply. My friends from high school mostly weren\u2019t around, either, so days passed so slowly. I have to admit, I enjoyed it at first, finally free of the deadlines, but without the friends and life I\u2019d built in college, all the fun things I wished I could do with my free time just weren\u2019t around to enjoy anymore. This past week has been so hard. I hardly bothered to leave my room much less the house.  But you know what, just when I felt like I needed to resign to this being my life, days of reminiscing for college, I got a call!  Last night, I got an interview for a job at my top choice of firms.  I\u2019m so excited, and it\u2019s really brought my life back into focus. Shopping tomorrow, interview prepping on Wednesday, and if all goes well, my first real job next month!"
