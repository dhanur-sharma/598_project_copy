        "Summarize the following story in first person: When people think of the scariest day of their life they often think of a near death experience or the loss of a loved one.   For me, it was when my wife started having complications while giving birth.  It all happened about 5 months ago when we were about to welcome the birth of our son.  It started off like we expected: my wife went into labor, we waited until the contractions were getting closer and then we headed for the hospital.  I thought everything seemed like it was going as planned but as I quickly learned, complications can happen suddenly.  As we were walking into the hospital my wife suddenly loss consciousness and I happened to catch her just as she was about to fall to the floor.  As the nurses rushed to her aid I was in shock of what was happening.  This couldn't possibly be normal.  Everything seemed to be in slow motion.  She was put on a stretcher, rushed to a room and I followed behind helplessly and numb from what was happening.  After the doctor arrived and several checks were done he explained that my wife was having some sort of complications, her airflow was being restricted and they needed to do emergency surgery to deliver our baby.  After everything was prepared I was allowed to stay by her side and watch as the doctor started the c-section to deliver our baby.  As he was doing the procedure he noticed what the issue was.  According to him, scar tissue from a previous surgery had attached itself to the underside of one side of her lung and the combination of that and the baby putting pressure on her organs had caused her to lose consciousness.  He said he'd never seen something like that happen but was expecting the pressure to be relieved once his procedure was finished.  Several minutes later I was able to hold our baby for the first time and shortly after that my wife woke from the procedure.  Needless to say I counted my blessings that day and our lives have never been the same."
