        "Summarize the following story in first person: So this event actually took place yesterday. I went on a bike ride, a really long bike ride with this girl that I've had a thing for off and on for the last three years. I hadn't been planning to hang out with her yesterday, but she texted me the night before asking if I wanted to join her on the ride. Of course I was going to go. I love hanging out with her. Anyway, we decided we were going to bike to all three towns that make up our area. In all, the ride was going to take about 2.5 hours. We get going and it's just a lot of fun. Beautiful day, earlier in the morning, and we were making good time and progress. It was great talking with her as we rode as well. Anyway, I knew that we would be crossing one of the bridges coming up to get over to the third town. This was the part that was going to bother me because I hate heights and the bike paths on the bridges are not great. I'm super tall and would end up falling over the railing if I messed up. We got to the bridge and I could feel my heart racing. I knew I had to walk my bike across on a path that was only wide enough for one biker at a time. She went on ahead to get over and I started walking. If someone else came up from behind, I would have to move really close to the road to give them room to pass. But surely there would be no one else right? I watched my friend go across as I continued to talk. All of a sudden, I heard a biker behind me. I had to move over. They passed without incident and I felt relived. Once I reached the bottom of the bike path, my heart stilled as well and I was no longer nervous. All in all, a great day on a bike with a great friend who I want to hang out more with."
