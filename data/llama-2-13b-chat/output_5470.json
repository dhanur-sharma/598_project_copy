        "Summarize the following story in first person: Today I drove to Connecticut to interview for a new job opportunity. I am moving to Connecticut with my boyfriend to be closer to work and this is the first job I have applied to. The job is a membership coordinator at a private country club, so it is something I have always said I could be happy doing. It was my second interview and I was feeling pretty nervous and excited. The first interview took place on Tuesday, and I stayed for almost two hours talking with the General Manager. Today, for my second interview, I toured the property with the General Manager and the current membership coordinator. After the tour, we sat down and talked for another hour or so, about two and a half hours in total. I left the interview feeling very confident. Even if I didn't get the job, I knew that I had interviewed well and had made it to the second round of candidates. It was between me and one other girl. That was an accomplishment in itself, because in the past interviews had not been my strong suit and made me very nervous. When I left the interview, my boyfriend called me. He was waiting for me outside of the interview to surprise me and I had driven right past him. That was the most special thing he could have done. I was so surprised and couldn't wait to hug him to calm myself down. We decided to grab some lunch/breakfast at a local diner. It was there during breakfast that I got the call. I had gotten the job! I was so excited. I had been stressed about trying to find a job in Connecticut for months, but I was able to get the first one I applied for. Even though my lease in Rhode Island wasn't up until June 1st, I was moving to Connecticut a few weeks early to start this new opportunity. It was a thrilling day and I still can't believe I have a big girl job now!"
