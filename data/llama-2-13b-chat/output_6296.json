        "Summarize the following story in first person: One of the few things that many people miss out on life is to have a close relationship with a dog. This was the case for me ever since I remember growing up which makes him feel like he is also part of the family too. Me and my dog share many memorable experiences which really mean alot to me for example it can be a really common thing such as spending time at the park. Another good thing we enjoy doing is spending quality time at the store. However if there was anything that meant alot to me it would be an event that happened not too long ago. Me and my dog were hanging out around four and a half months ago having a good time, we we're at the beach. The weather was amazing and hot you could tell the spoiled dog is having abundant fun time. I got him ice cream that day I remember like it was yesterday which is really cool. It reminded me of the other time I got him some at the park when he was with his buddies which was enjoyable to all of them. Another thing is that specific day at the beach I remember looking slightly across the road and he was just there chilling on his own. He seemed to be having a fun time which is something he always does. There really isnt much to it but to see it you should have seen the look on his face. Dogs are really beautiful creatures that we care about. They are the reason for many things to happen because at the end of the day they are still cool. There is no reason for anything bad to come out of this, he was truly enjoying his time. And the more I think about it the more entertaining to story gets to me because of his tongue being out."
