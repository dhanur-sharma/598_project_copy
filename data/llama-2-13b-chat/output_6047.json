        "Summarize the following story in first person: The first time I ever fell in love. She made me feel like there could be no wrong in the world. She was beautiful, she was kind, she would take care of me, bug me until I told her what was on my mind and somehow knew when I should and when I didn't need to talk about something, and then make me feel better afterwards. She knew me like nobody else did. Not my friends, not my family. She would make sure I ate when I was hanging out with her, she would get me a drink even if I had money, and I just...felt safe with her. She was so nice to me. I did nothing to deserve her, I met her by chance because I was sitting on a bench in a bit of a downer and she came over to see what was wrong with me, a complete stranger. It was in Fall, and it was at that sorta perfect time of year where all the gorgeous colors had come out, but barely any of the leaves had fallen from the trees, so it just looked incredible. I hadn't had really any sleep at all that day, and it had gone by really really slowly for me. I met up with her in our usual spot, and she could immediately tell something was up. I could tell by the look on her face that I looked like complete crap, that and the fact that she got up and gave me a hug without saying anything. She walked over with me, and sat down with me, not letting go of me all the while. She looked at me expectantly, and I just sighed and said \"I don't suppose I could get away with not explaining today, could I?\" and she just shook her head, making us both laugh a little. I hugged her again, and everything just started to pour out. I'd explained everything that happened that day that led to why I looked like such crap, and she sat there and listened the entire time, the same as she always did."
