        "Summarize the following story in first person: My most memorable childhood event was last year  the Fourth of July. A big family vacation a barbeque, over night stay and out of town trip to six flags, and I had a blast the night before me, my mom, sisters and brother packed our bags to stay the night over my cousin house in Goodlettsville ,Tennessee. She had the biggest house ever I thought it was a mansion; six bedrooms two an half bath, a swimming pool, a game/movie room with a nice big kitchen. It was something that I was not use, knowing that we stayed in a three bedroom based on an income apartment on the East side of Nashville. Arriving to my cousin house i seen a lot of my family members even the ones that was from out of town A Memorable Experience in Photography To experience photography, one must have a certain style of photographs to really appreciate or admire. Photographs are picturesque images and views thatreally catch the interest of the photographer. For me to experience and admirephotography, it took me only one photographer to really appreciate the power ithas his name is Robert Capa. Robert grew up in Hungary he experienced thepolitical unrest and turmoil. He lived under the oppression of Horthy andknew the kind of anarchy that constitutes war(Images of War 8). His work also had a swift understanding and sympathy for the people who sufferfrom being caught in war. This type of suffering made it impossible for himto ignore the events which affected their lives(Images of War 9). Robert'sbelief on photography is \"If your pictures are not good enough, your not closeenough\"(Photographs Foreword).Robert's breakthrough in the field of photography came during the Spanish CivilWar. His most famous picture was a snapshot of a courageous man in the act offalling(Capa18). His own special talents and course of world happenings, ledhim into a role as a professional photographer of war(Images of War20). Toreally admire and understand Capa, you must have a fascination for dramatic andemotional pictures of war. There probably has been thousands who admire thework he does. Well you can include me in that group of thousands. Capa putsinto perspective in just one photograph, something my grandfather will neverforget. The Bombing of Pearl Harbor. The photograph that brings back thesememories is taken somewhere in Europe during World War II. I"
