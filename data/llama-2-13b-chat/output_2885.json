        "Summarize the following story in first person: After the pain - The healing. After the Urgent Care visit and the pain subsided, I worried it might come back. The whole day I kept ice firmly pressed against the area, trying my best to keep it at bay. The anxiousness and anxiety it caused was not good. It kept me from sleeping or focusing well, and also from working. I worried - will I need to take more pain medicine? Will the infection return? Thankfully, with full rest, mouth rinse, and a positive outlook, the pain was no more. Now, I make sure to rinse daily with this unique mouth wash and so far it's been pretty positive. Also of note, I ended up making up my work and being given reduced hours, which helped me make up the amount of money lost. The doctor at the Urgent Care Center stated it appeared to be an infection resulting from impacted wisdom teeth. Wisdom Teeth come in around 17 years of age, or start to and eventually become impacted. Impaction leads to vision problems, pain, on site infection, and shifting teeth among other things. I have experienced some pain for years over this, but only recently, has it become so bad that it incapacitates me. While I personally do not want to undergo wisdom tooth extraction, I definitely recommend it if you suffer."
