        "Summarize the following story in first person: A couple months ago I had the strangest dream.  For me however, there was nothing strange about it, it's very run of the mill.   For me, the strange part, is that I actually am taking the time to write it down.  The dream started with me laying on my childhood bed.  My mother in the next room started complaining about the noises outside her window and how she was trying to sleep.  I peaked out of my window and looked  towards the neighbors ' house, not much noise coming from there.  I decided to go outside and see what else was going on.  Ahh, this must be what she's barking about, a father showing his son how to use the recycling bins.   \"It's nothing Mom!\"  I yelled as I headed back to the bed room.  In that instant I remember being semi conscious it was a dream and a voice, either my own, or maybe even the father outside made a comment somehow unknowingly on the situation: \"See when you work for 30 years, you earn the money to build a life for you so that you can enjoy your life after.\" Unlike my mother's situation where she lay in bed jobless, complaining.  I went in the living room and noticed drawers full of pink starburst, \"Just like in real life.\"  I thought, knowing I bought a bag about a week ago, having a brief second of knowing that this was all a dream.   Shortly however I was back to being unaware.  I thought about our neighborhood and what it would look like with a lake.   \"We could shoot all kind of game!\" Explained a man who was suddenly in my living room.  I asked \"Do you think they would stock it with bass?\"  Figuring a hunter would know such things.  \"Of course!\" He replied.  I then realized that this was all a daydream.   To which point I thought if I told my mother she would try it and relax for a bit.  It kept going but I think this is a good summary for now!"
