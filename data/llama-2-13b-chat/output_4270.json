        "Summarize the following story in first person: So I am usually a people pleaser.  I also hate to be the cause of conflict. So here I am, at work, feeling queasy from morning sickness (I\u2019m 8 weeks)And I get a message from DH\u2019s Aunt. She asks me if I had anything planned for my birthday which is in about 3 weeks. I figure she\u2019s just organising her families calendar, so I say \u201cnothing as of yet, when I do it might just be low key pizzas at our house\u201d (We are actually organising something so we can announce we are pregnant to his family!)And she writes a spiel about her MLM (I forgot she was involved in) and how she can host a party for me and my friends and it will be loads of fun and we will get loads of freebies and blah blah blah. And I instantly get a cold sweat, I wonder how I can explain to her that I\u2019m fundamentally against supporting MLMs without pissing her off, if it\u2019s less hassle to just let her throw one, while also being irritated that she would even ask.  Every invite I\u2019ve received from her so far on FB, I\u2019ve just ignored, hoping she wouldn\u2019t notice me among all the other women she invited. Then the hormone monster took over for a second, and I  wrote \u201cNo, thank you\u201d and hit send. And she wrote back \u201cOh, OK\u201d And that\u2019s it!  And now I\u2019m sitting here with a stupid grin on my face because I feel relieved that I didn\u2019t do what I normally would do which is stew over it for days, trying to figure out how to tiptoe around the issue, or bean dip, meanwhile stressing myself out.                                                                                                                                                                                 My original instinct was not to \u201cgo on a rant\u201d, it was the feeling of needing to justify my response, and the stress of trying to figure out how to justify my lack of wanting to be involved, without hurting any feelings. I did not say that MLM people are crazy monsters.  I do think the MLM business model is unethical and I hate having friends and family trying to sell me things.  But that wasn\u2019t my point of posting. My point was that I was trying to come up with a good excuse or response and was feeling stressed about it, when all I needed to say was \u201cno\u201d.  I\u2019m very bad at doing that, and it felt good to do so.  I did the same thing throughout my wedding, so I thought I\u2019d share as a reminder that it\u2019s okay to say no."
