        "Summarize the following story in first person: While doing some research on the internet for a car I had seen locally, I finally found the car that I had been wanting for the longest time, since about 2007, a Dodge Charger. It was like the best surprise I could have gotten regarding getting another car. The year and model of the car I wanted wasn't new. It had been really hard to find this kind of car with low miles, for a price I could afford, and in an acceptable color. I was willing to accept anything in the 2007 - 2010 range. People told me it wouldn't be possible to find a car more than 5 years old with low miles. Someone said, \"Good luck with that, those cars aren't made for sitting!\" Well, I came across some good luck. Because I would be making a major purchase and would have to travel a long distance to get this car, I made sure to ask all kinds of details about how the car could be in such good shape for 10 years old.  It just so happened that the car I wanted was part of a fleet of police vehicles, and not just another patrol car. It was being used by a government official and it was not driven very often. The best part of all was that on top of the car being in such good shape and the price being somewhat affordable, when I told my salesman that I didn't have as much money for a down payment as they initially requested, I was able to negotiate the down payment amount and the price of the car. I was able to negotiate the whole deal before and get approved for a loan before I even got to the dealership. I had to travel about 230 miles one way so the salesman worked hard to arrange everything in advance. All I had to do when I got there was take a test drive and sign the paper work. They even game me more money for my old car towards the down payment than I had anticipated.  Everything fell into place for me so well, with the exception of having to make monthly payments, it was unbelievable."
