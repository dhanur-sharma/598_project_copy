        "Summarize the following story in first person: The Hawaiian people are fierce protectors of their nation. Of their land, people, and treasures. The sacred mountain Mauna Kea has been sought after for its precious views. The Hawaiian people, though, see this mountain as one of their greatest treasures. They will not let it be used for scientific purposes. In particular, the scientists of an astrological organization have been attempting to use some of the land to place a telescope. This mountain has the perfect coordinates to see well into space. It would allow for cosmic objects to be observed. However, since the Hawaiian people greatly value this mountain, it has been difficult for the construction of this telescope to occur. It has certain ethical and moral reasons. This has always been the Hawaiian people's land, and the telescope cannot just be built there without their permission. There have been a lot of protests in Hawaii due to the proposed construction of the telescope. After the first attempted construction that led to the death of a Hawaiian after some conflict, there has been a standstill. Neither side has made a move, and the Hawaiians especially are upset with even the proposition of this telescope. Access to the area has been blocked, and the Hawaiian people will do anything to stop them."
