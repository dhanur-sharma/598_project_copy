My father gave her a hug and said everything will be ok. I was scared. I was sad. We went back next week for another test. The test came back positive. We were so happy of this good news. I gave my father a big hug. I gave my mother a bigger hug. We all gave each other a big bear hug. We were so thrilled that she didn't have to go and get surgery. I am thankful that she is healthy. She is very healthy now and I am great that she isn't in pain. She is smiling everyday now."
