        "Summarize the following story in first person: So, out of the blue one day me ex contacted me. It had been a really long time since we spoke. I was pretty sure that I would never hear from her again at this point, so I was quite surprised. We chatted for a while and decided to meet up for something to eat and some drinks. I was pretty nervous to see her again. Honestly I had missed her all these years. The breakup had really hurt me for a long time. She was truly the first person I truly loved. So while I was nervous, I was also very exited. I remember trying on so many different outfits to make a good impression. I finally decided on a nice black button down shirt. I matched with black boots and dark blue jeans. Then the time came to finally meet. I also remember my hair was looking good that day, so that was good! Anyways, I got in my car to go to the restaurant. She looked absolutely stunning! We hugged and sat down together. The conversation was really great, like we never missed a beat. The whole thing felt really natural. Then it was time for us to part, so we walked outside together. We kissed and it felt so damn good! I've been thinking of this moment since then. In a way I wish we continued an affair. But that's not what happened. After that kiss we agreed not to act on those feelings."

So we went our separate ways. It's been a few weeks now and I've been doing okay. I've been reflecting on our relationship and I'm really glad that we had that time together. I miss her but I'm also happy that we can still be friends. I'm just taking things one day at a time now."
