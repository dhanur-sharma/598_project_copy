        "Summarize the following story in first person: I will never forget the day my life changed. My five year son had been acting odd peeing the bed, excessively drinking and eating a ton of food for about two weeks so I decided to take him in to the doctor. I was sitting  in the physician's office waiting on his urine test result when she came in to tell us yes there was glucose in his urine and next we would do a finger stick. The fingerstick reading was 562. We were in utter shock as she told us we needed to rush him to the hospital immediately and could not stop at home to grab clothes. In the ER the antibody tests were run, we were told we would need to stay in the hospital for three days for Type one diabetes training. I stared at my little boy in the hospital bed hooked up to an IV in disbelief. I could not believe that just hours ago I had given him breakfast without a care in the world and now he would need insulin with each meal to even survive. It was so hard to wrap my head around the fact that without insulin my child would die and he would need it for the rest of his life. The next days were filled with holding down a crying five year old giving him shots, him tearfully asking when his diabetes would go away and me sneaking in to the hospital bathroom to cry. It was a time of grieving the life that he would never have, a life without insulin. It was a time of sorting thru the mess and finding hope as well. Seeing the tiny triumphs of him not crying thru his last finger pokes in the hospital and his excitement to leave the hospital behind and just head back to being a child with a few minor adjustments. As much as that time shook me to my core and brought me to my knees with grief I also saw strength and hope in a child that I never imagined I would see. I may be here to raise and protect my son but he is my hero and he saved me by teaching me that there is hope and light in even the darkest of circumstances."
