        "Summarize the following story in first person: Dear Diary,  I recently went through a very emotional time in my life. My grandma in Oregon passed away a couple weeks ago. The process was painful to hear about and it hit me harder than I thought it would. I was very close with my grandma and so was my mom. My mom's siblings put her on Hospice about three weeks ago and within a week she was gone. There was a lot of family drama over the passing of her and I did not agree with with how she was taken care of in the end. I feel she was pushed into the direction of death by being heavily medicated and her family members that were there were not getting her up out of bed anymore. I realize people get old and everyone's time comes but I feel like it wasn't her time yet. But you can't go back in time and she's gone now. I was able to travel with my parents and sister to Oregon to attend her funeral. It was an emotional roller coaster. The hardest day for me was when the day before her funeral I found out that there had been rules put in place by my Uncle that no grand kids were going to be able to go view my grandma and say goodbye. Because of all the drama, he wanted to hurt everyone he could that wasn't on his side. I went to the funeral home with my parents anyway in hopes that I might still get a chance. After arguing with the funeral director, it was decided that I would not be able to go in the room. I was crushed, I was so hurt and upset but I was trying to hold it together for my mom. My mom was able to go in for a while and sit with her mom so I waited outside with other family members. After some time, my mom came outside in a hurry and told me to come quickly. I didn't know what had happened but apparently the funeral director had a change of heart and decided to go against the request of my Uncle and let me go view my Grandma. Walking in that room was so surreal. I couldn't believe my beloved grandma was laying there in her coffin. I never thought it would bother me as much as it did. I couldn't even bring myself to touch her, I guess I was scared or in denial. It was an emotional couple of weeks to say the least."
