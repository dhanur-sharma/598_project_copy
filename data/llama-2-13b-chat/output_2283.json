        "Summarize the following story in first person: It's about my grandmother, mother of my mother.  She has altogether 25 grandchildren and I am probably the only one who grew under care or should I stay I stayed with her the longest duration of all children.  That's probably why she is very connected to me.  She was a robust woman from village in remote Nepal.  She was strong as an ox, never took a pill of a medication in her mouth.  But that one day, must be the fate, her dress got caught in something in the road and she fell.  Passerby in the street took her to the hospital.  Fortunately, the doctor treating her happened to be a friend of my elder sister so we came to know about it and we reached the hospital.  We found out she had a frontal hematoma that couldn't be fixed.  They said they will do everything in their power, but who are we kidding here, they are not god. They are trained professional who will try their best.  So the operation began to drain the blood.  Good thing, they drained it.  Bad thing, it couldn't be completely drained as it kept filling back.  With that complication, she lost her memory and was in a dementia-type state.  When she woke up after the operation, she did not recognize anyone and everyone in the room was crying.  That day, I had a meeting so I was the last one to reach there. When I entered the room, she called me by name and everyone was surprised.  That is the best moment in my life that out of that gloomy limbo and darkness, she still knew who I was.  I hugged her and I sat beside her telling her all the things she missed. The funny thing in that room was after she called out my name, all the other children, my cousins, they were crying not because they were sad about grandmother's state but because they were jealous, she knew only my name.  One week after that, she passed away peacefully in her sleep.  I didn't cry at all not because I didn't want to but because for some reason, I couldn't.  Still to this day, I am trying to find out why but still I think about her everyday but I never feel like crying."
