        "Summarize the following story in first person: After mulling things over for a couple years, I finally decided to sell my house. I decided just before Christmas, but I went into action right after Christmas. One option was to sell as is, which would potentially be quicker. I tried listing it on Craigslist and Facebook. No takers, though plenty were interested. I also tried selling it to one of those \"We Buy Houses\" guys. Waste of time. Simultaneously, I was looking at doing repairs and painting for to either sell myself at a higher price or through a realtor. I could do the work myself, with friends, or by hiring contractors. I preferred the latter. The problem was no one seemed to want the work! Two, maybe three contractors I contacted ghosted me by not showing up to give a bid. Was it the address? Holiday mood? I don't know, but it was frustrating. I had two friends who'd potentially help me knock out the work, but they wouldn't be available for a few weeks. It was stressful juggling all those options and not knowing which would pan out. Most would try one at a time, but I really wanted to get this settled and get out of town. Finally, I found some contractors through my neighbor. Those guys showed up the next Monday, knocked the work out for a low price and did very decent work. I was able to list the house and settled on an offer in 1-2 weeks, getting a decent sale price. Managing all that in a compressed time frame wore me out. I think it was about a three-week journey until the house was cleaned up and listed through a realtor -- a very intense three weeks."
