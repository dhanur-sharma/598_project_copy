        "Summarize the following story in first person: I have an day here in my financial record the time of debt I had from driving an car. Not one car but two, the 98 Ford Mustang the later matching my last name of the Ford expedition. AN tour with an Army unit the first time buyer cost jumped out the roof. My unknown phenomenon was credited to my version of street racing. When Ford Motor all but eliminated passenger cars from its North American lineup earlier this month to concentrate on trucks and S.U.V.s, it turned the page on a long and storied history of now-defunct but once red-hot nameplates: the Model T, the Model A, the Galaxie, the Fairlane, the Thunderbird and the Falcon, to name several. There was one conspicuous survivor: the Mustang.\u201cGet rid of the Mustang?\u201d asked James D. Farley Jr., Ford\u2019s president of global markets, when I asked him this week how the Mustang had survived. \u201cThe Mustang is like Rocky: It survived the 1970s fuel crisis, the glam 1980s, the move to S.U.V.s. It\u2019s made it through every round of cuts.\u201dFor me, the Mustang\u2019s reprieve came as welcome news: I took my driver\u2019s test in my mother\u2019s 1967 turquoise Mustang notchback. On the rare occasions I was allowed to drive it, it conferred instant status and triggered unabashed envy among my high school classmates. Wall Street probably would have been just as happy to see the Mustang go the way of the Fusion, Taurus and Fiesta, current models that Ford said it would phase out and which Mr. Farley dismissed as \u201ccommodity silhouettes.\u201d (Ford says it will continue to make passenger vehicles, but they just won\u2019t be in the shape of today\u2019s sedan. The Focus, for example, will survive, but as a crossover S.U.V.)That\u2019s because in its last earnings report, Ford revealed for the first time that a relatively small number of products, including the hugely popular F-150 pickup truck series, accounted for 150 percent of its earnings before interest and taxes, with profit margins in the midteens. Another group was barely profitable. By contrast, Ford said its \u201clow performing\u201d products lost money, with negative margins of more than 10 percent."

The car has a loyal following among enthusiasts and has inspired countless custom versions and special editions over the years. It also has a strong presence on the racetrack, with Ford\u2019s Mustang GT4 race car winning its class at the 24 Hours of Daytona and the 12 Hours of Sebring endurance races. The Mustang has also been the subject of several Hollywood movies, including the 2000 film \u201cGone in 60 Seconds,\u201d starring Nicolas Cage and Angelina Jolie. \u201cThe Mustang is the soul of the company,\u201d said Mr. Farley, who started his career at Ford as a summer intern in 1989. \u201cThe Mustang is a symbol of American freedom, American innovation and American grit. It\u2019s a brand that\u2019s bigger than just a car.\u201d"
