        "Summarize the following story in first person: Well she left again, my mother. This is not the first time she has left, but it is a painfully familiar. As a child she was always very distant yet always there like a black hole hanging over a galaxy or a unseen pocket in a room, the darkness simultaneously hints the existence of something and nothing. She took care of me as she was suppose to, but she treated these transaction like a job and no real warmth could be felt. My dad was quite the opposite. He was a constant presence and keystone in my existence. He was funny and very perceptive and whenever he was a round I laughed and played, but there was constant arguing in my household. My dad was always  dissatisfied with my mom and when they argued it was very violent and insult filled. One day my mother and father were in an especially terrible argument over the common disagreement subject, money. Money and me were the top agitators. When the fighting begins logic is in the leed, but when one of them begins to lose that's when the insults begin to take center stage. This time my mother was the one losing this battle so she comments on my father's manhood and other inadequacies when compared to other males, particularly the one she has been cheating with behind his back. This is when my father hits my mother which sends her to the floor and out of our lives. She of course did not bring me along, this was a surprise to no one. The following year became really tough. My father was not the happy man he was when my mother was around and he turned into this stressed person. He fought to pay the bills and worked most of the time, I mostly took care of myself. This changed when she returned for health reasons. Things were good for a while,but inconsistent. She eventually left for minnesota for six months to visit family as she states, but I don't think she will be coming back."
