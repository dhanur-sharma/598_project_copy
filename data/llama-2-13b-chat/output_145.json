        "Summarize the following story in first person: One of the most memorable please my life was when I graduated from my graduate school in May 2019. This day which was actually May 16, 2019, was one of the best days of my life for several reasons. Number one, I worked extremely hard to my patient studies to make sure that I graduated in only five years which a lot of people do not do. Because I was able to accomplish this in such a short time, I was extremely proud of myself and I felt that this was one of the greatest accomplishments of my life. I spent many nights in many weekends working extremely hard in the laboratory doing homework\u2019s studying and doing very difficult experiments just to make sure that I had all of the data necessary to graduate. My family and I had to make a lot of sacrifices  during my five years to make sure that I was going to graduate and finish my degree. My family and I knew that this would be a long-term investment so we put all of our resources into it. On that day I feel like I finally had accomplished everything that I want it and I was going to be able to get back to my family. This is why that day was so so significantly memorable for me. I felt that I had to finally achieved one of my major life goals and my family and I were actually together getting this PhD just myself. Today or still remember that day like it was yesterday was a day that I\u2019m going to remember for the rest of my life. It is a day that will live on in our family and something that will actually carry-on to other generations inspire other dinner .I am the first one in my family to obtain an advanced degree and because of this I know that future generations will actually  no that anything is possible. I am looking to inspire future generations of my family and I know that it all starts with my graduation. That PhD degree is going to take me anywhere I want to my career which is why I am so happy that I\u2019ll site able to finish it. I am looking to make a big difference in our world and I know that my degree in my education will allow me to do just that. I don\u2019t see work that\u2019s just work but I want to have a job that I can have fun and make a really big impact in the scientific world. I now have the opportunity because of this day and this is why this is my entry into one of the most memorable moments of my life especially in the last six months."
