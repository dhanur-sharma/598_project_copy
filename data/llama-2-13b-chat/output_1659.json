        "Summarize the following story in first person: The most memorable event that has happened to me in the last 3-6 months was my family (Dad, Mom, and Son) coming to see me at my apartment and taking us on a vacation from Tulsa, OK to around Joplin, Missouri. I haven't been on vacation in years, and my dad decided all four of us should take a vacation, and spend a few nights at the Down Stream Casino on the Oklahoma Missouri border. Being with my closest family member's meant the world to me. We started out at my apartment in Tulsa, OK and we drove about an hour and 15 minutes to our destination. When we first arrived I bought some Ice Cream at the casino's Ice Cream stand for my Son and I. After that we got the keys to our room, and brought all of our luggage there. We shared two rooms, and the rooms were extremely nice, and comfortable to relax and sleep in. I stayed in one room with my son, and my parents stayed in another. I didn't participate in much gambling, instead we watched Ellen DeGeneres Game show, and stayed up late watching TV and having good conversation with my son, and parents. After that we drove to a local restaurant, and had dinner together. Then my dad took me on a tour of the casino, bar, and slot machines. He showed me the machines he likes playing, I played with 20 dollars, and ended up cashing out 40, so I made a nice little profit.  I will always cherish this vacation with my close family member's that I don't always get to see. Their kindness and love will always radiate with me, and I will always remember them choosing to spend time with me, and make my day that much better. I will always remember this trip, and the fun times I had with my family. They will always be in my heart."
