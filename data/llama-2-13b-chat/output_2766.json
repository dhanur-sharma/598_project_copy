        "Summarize the following story in first person: As long as I can remember, my mom has had the dream of a little white fence and a suburban home. This has been all she talked about for years. She's always had dreams of this. We had lived in a small broken down home in the projects all my life. My mom raised us to go after dreams and to do better than she had done. We never took that as just lip service since she was always telling us that but also showed us how to go above our situations. When I was 16, my mom went and got herself a small job in a factory. She needed the money and we took care of the home while she worked. For years, she slowly moved up from being on the \"belt\" to being in HR. She loved what she did and felt accomplished no matter what she was doing. Being able to take pride in any job she had was a lesson that by seeing her work, was something that she taught us. I didn't know that she had been saving for home. On the day her last child moved out, she told us that she had been saving money and wanted us to have it. She selflessly worked to make money to help us. We had all found good work and got out of the projects, we told her to get her dream home with it. She refused. We took the money and ended up coming together and finding her the perfect home. She had done so much for us, we wanted to do something for her. We even furnished the home for her. When we surprised her with it, she cried and begged us to not do this and to take the home back. It took some convincing but she ended up moving into the home. She's been loving it ever since."

She has taught me that no matter where you come from, you can achieve anything if you work hard. She's still the same person who would go to work and then come home and cook for us. She's still the same person who would take us to school and pick us up. She's still the same person who would stay up late and help us with our homework. But now she has a new home and a new sense of pride and accomplishment. She's still my mom, but now she has a new place to call her own."
