        "Summarize the following story in first person: The birth of my first son was in essence the first time I fell in love.The way I know, even though it happened only a month ago, is that for the first time in my life, someone else is more important than me.     I have always lived my life with the question bearing down like a heavy weight: What do I want? How shall I spend my day? Too much freedom is a heavy burden.    Even though I love to sleep, and in the last month I haven't done all that much of it, I have never felt so free. Maybe it would feel different if there were a man around. I am sleep deprived and I should feel overwhelmed, but I guess I don't have time. I mean, this is the first time I have written since the Blessed Event:     I had just finished my work for Maternity Leave (  3 whole months! )I knew all day I felt different, but honestly thought it might have been the Mexican I'd eaten at lunch. But it was a crazy coincidence that after I went to my neighborhood pool after work, swimming in the slow lane, next to a duck of all things (?) I got out of the pool and felt my water break. Like a cork pulled from a bottle of fizzy champagne. ( People have since asked how I knew. Water was already pouring down my legs. I would just tell them \"There is no mistaking a bottle of champagne uncorking between ones legs!\") I got right home, waddling like said Duck from the slow lane. Two slow blocks. I have been living with my Dad and Step-Mother, as you know Diary, and my Dad recalled my Mom's LABORS TO BE FAST, so he ignored my mid-wives reccommendation to call her when the contractions started coming closer together than they were ( 5 minutes, but what did I know? Could be Braxtons I thought. Like the Mexican Food, life can send the wrong message from brain to body, I figured.)     Good thing we listened to the old man, it was 8 hours from start to finish, but it felt like a lot less. Memory blocks pain, I am told, so that's where all those lost minutes that add up to 7 hours went.   By 1:26 A.M. I had a boy. I pushed for an hour, the hour that changed me into a mom more than anything. I now believe I can do anything I have to. And afterwards they handed me this tiny red-headed chicken, and for the first time in my life I knew what it was like to love someone more than myself."
