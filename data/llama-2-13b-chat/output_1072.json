But things just didn't go as planned. I don't think this was my fault. There were things out of my control. I tried to reel us back in as best as  I could. but sometimes expectations exceed reality. We were running a course that I just could not seem to correct. Management wanted us to make changes. We explored those changes in the workgroup. But it seems those changes just are not feesible. We tried coming at it a different way, but this ship was doomed. It was a good reminder to everyone involved that sometimes we need to manage our expectations."
