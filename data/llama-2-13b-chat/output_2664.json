        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 4 months ago I was on Spring Break with some girlfriends.  We had a great day at the beach and then decided to go for a couple of drinks.  The restaurant bar was pretty busy and noisy, but we couldn't help noticing a really cute group of guys sitting at the next table.  After about a half hour one of them came over to ask if we wanted to join them for drinks.  We did.  I found myself seated next to this really cute guy a bit older than me with dark brown hair.   We started talking and it turned out that we had some friends in common.  We also lived in the same neigbourhood.  He seemed really friendly and had a great sense of humour, which is a real plus for me.  After a couple of hours of chatting it was time to leave.  I had my car with me and my friends all seemed to have paired off with the other guys at the table.  I decided to offer this guy a lift home even though it was a bit out of character for me.  He quickly agreed and we walked to my car chatting along the way.  When we were about two blocks from his apartment he turned off the car radio and said he had to ask me something.  I thought that he was going to ask me out.  Instead, he told me that he lived with his girlfriend and that they had been together since high school.  He said that things were good between them, but that he was looking for \"a bit more\".  He asked me if I would consider being his girlfriend \"on the side.\"  I asked him exactly what that meant.  He gave me a cocky smile and said \"you know.\"  I told him that was not my style and pulled up in front of his building.  He told me that he was sorry to hear that I felt that way and had thought we hit it off.  I didn't answer him and he got out of the car.  It's been four months and I often find myself thinking of him and driving past his apartment building.  I wonder if I made a mistake?"
