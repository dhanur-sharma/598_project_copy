        "Summarize the following story in first person: My family and I were travelling in Washington State along I-90 one summer day.  The weather was overcast but warm.  As my wife was driving, I heard a yell, it was my wife.  A large dust cloud had appeared before us, obscuring the roadway.  I had my wife pull over and put on the blinkers immediatly.  There was a Toyota 4 Runner with a smashed front end in the passing lane and a Honda Civic that was just barely half the size it was before.  A leg was sticking out of the driver seat.  All traffic slowed and all of a sudden a lot of people got out of their cars and rushed over to the Honda Civic.  Everyone that looked inside the car immediately looked up and had a white look on their face, like they had seen a ghost.  I assumed everyone knew that the man inside was going to die.  I assume he was mechanically decapitated from the impact as he was parked and the 4-runner was travelling faster than the speed limit as it was.  I heard screaming from behind me, a woman appeared from out of the bushes.  She was stunned, the walking dead, but she appeared to be ok.  My wife had her sit down and just then a State Trooper arrived.  I told him to go to the car.  He was mad at me for directing him but he did so.  He looked in the car and stood up, his face white. The man died later at the hospital and the woman survived, a widow."
