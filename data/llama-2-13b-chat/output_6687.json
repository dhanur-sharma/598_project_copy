        "Summarize the following story in first person: My most memorable trip occurred the early part of this month. I went To Russia with my dad. I went specifically to Moscow. It was a very positive experience for me. I have never been overseas in my whole life. The furthest I have ever been to in my life was Canada.  I saw in Russia so many sights. I saw the Kremlin. I saw the Bolshoi theater and a ballet performance there. I got to taste some good Russian cuisine like beef stroganoff. Napoleon cakes are delicious. I spent immense quality time with my dad in the trip which lasted two and a half weeks. I also made day trips to the Russian countryside. I experienced life in the small villages. Very humble life there. I am literally longing to go back to Russia very soon. I truly miss it. I went to countless museums and Red Square."
