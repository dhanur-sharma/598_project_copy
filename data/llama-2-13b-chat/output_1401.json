        "Summarize the following story in first person: I am a professional photographer and recently reached a big milestone as a photographer. I had my first portrait published in a magazine. This was very exciting and made me very happy! I had been trying for a little while to get a portrait published and when it finally happened I couldn't have been more excited! The portrait that was published was a portrait of my child, which made it even more special. I was so excited when I found out I just kept thanking God, and cried tears of joy! I messaged my husband to tell him the news! He was so excited and happy for me and was very supportive. I also messaged some family members and they were also very happy to hear the news. Everyone was very happy about the news and that was great! I ordered a copy of the magazine and couldn't wait for it to come in. When it came in I was brimming with excitement! I was overjoyed when I opened the magazine and saw my portrait! I couldn't believe how great it looked! I showed it to my child and they were also very excited to see their portrait in the magazine. This was such an exciting time and great milestone as a photographer."
