He was baptized as Herman.  The only mishap was his peeing in the font.  Taking on a godchild is a great blessing for us.  My wife and I do not have children of our own.  This is how we are building our family.  It's a  great responsibility, being responsible for helping in the spiritual development of a child. But it's one we take on with excitement.  His parents have become closer friends.  That is also a blessing.  Our other godchildren do not live nearby.  We were very glad to take on another."
