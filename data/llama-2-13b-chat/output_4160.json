        "Summarize the following story in first person: My family and I were traveling to see our third grandchild for the first time. We arrived safely to out destination that was 35 miles away. I walk with a cane because of bad feet and being out of normal balance. I walked in the door of my young sons house.  My oldest son greeted me with a big smile on his face and a bundle in his arms. I figured that was out baby he was holding. He offered for me to take Baby,  Shona. I wanted too, but due to my terrible awkwardness I turned the idea down.  I needed to sit to hold the newborn. I walked across the room and sat on a nice couch. The moment I settled in he hand me the wrapped up baby.  I opened the blanket to see her.  My first sight was deep blue eyes and light brown skin. We are a very white family.  I immediatly became suspicious of the eyes, the were too blue for a newborn. I looked up to say \"what is this?' They had playfully given me a doll that my oldest granddaughter owned. My daughter in law was holding the real baby and started to giggle. It was her idea to pull a trick on me. It was funny to everyone."
