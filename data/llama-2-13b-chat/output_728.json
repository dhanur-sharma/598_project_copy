        "Summarize the following story in first person: These events occurred between august and September 2019. My family moving away, in this event something I knew was going to happen eventually happened, I'm not a very social person and some of my only friends are my siblings, and on this day they moved away. This was a normal day like any other and I had both of my siblings moving away for college, we had a rather normal day watching tv, namely avatar the last airbender, we watched it like we always do on sunday evenings and it was honestly kind of depressing knowing it was the last time for years we would do it. The day was fast, we all talked and laughed and we cleaned up my sisters room together to get everything we wanted out of it before she left, I remember watching her walk up her stairs and go out the door, and get into her car and leave, it was a little heartbreaking. My brother just left, we had both cleaned his room too and he was ready to go, he had been getting in fights and arguing with my mom a lot, they were both ready for him to go. They had both prepared for college and were going to be leaving soon around 6pm, they were getting ready to go on with their lives, and to live their futures without me. I felt happy for them, I know they were both going to do great things, one was going to art school in new Jersey and the other was going to study Dance in Chicago, both prestigious places. I did feel great sadness though, they were two of my closest friends, two people who really understood me, and they were both leaving, and I had few other people to talk to. I tried to get them involved in everything before they went, I tried mini-golfing,movie watching, mystery shopping and just plane video games and board games, and we did have a blast, but it was depressing knowing they were still going to leave the very next week. I even got them involved in money making schemes like apps and survey programs, but they weren't interested, my best friends they may have been but they still didn't share all my interest. I also tried to get them involved in Overwatch and Minecraft and other online games so we could have things to do and they agreed to play but they unfortunately faded out of them, and they left our group. They still continued to chat every once and while and we watch shows streamed but they get farther and farther away chatting with their own groups and making new friends, I try but its hard to get them interested and they're growing more and more distant, and it hurts. I've purchased tickets to allow my brother to travel to come see me in Lincoln for thanksgiving and I'm excited, he's said he's ready to come back for a bit and come see the family. I'm excited and I'm ready to try to bond with him again and I'm excited to see how he is. My sister is coming back too, so I can't wait to see how she is and see if the events of the day she left have any effects on how our personality's have developed."
