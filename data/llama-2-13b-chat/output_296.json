        "Summarize the following story in first person: We went gem mining up in the mountains. Or rather, we went panning. It was a lot of fun. We'd originally gone to do a highland games festival, but couldn't make it. Since we were up there anyways, and had children with out group (as well as myself, the resident mental child haha,) we looked for other things to do. We wound up walking around a tourist trap attached to our camp ground, though the gem experience we wanted to do there was closed. One of the kids, the only girl, announced that her dad had promised her this last year that he'd take her gem mining. So I looked online and found something just down the road. We hopped in a minivan, one person sitting on the floor, and scooted across the road to this one nearest to us. We only spent $75 for 8 of us, which was pretty good for well over an hours entertainment. We all ended up with at least three precious gems. Most of us had more. My husband and I had the fewest, mostly due to the kids realizing I know rocks and asking me for lots of help. The little girl found a geode in one of our buckets as well. The kids later crushed it with a rock. They couldn't wait for us to find a hammer to crack it for them. It was cute, how excited they were. And that way, every kid got a piece. My favorite find was a nice sapphire, as well as a few emeralds that are cutting quality. It was a fantastic experience, and one I plant to make my husband take me on again."
