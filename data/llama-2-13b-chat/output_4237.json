        "Summarize the following story in first person: The event that I thought about first was visiting my parents for Mother's Day. I don't get much time to visit my parents so anytime that I am able to I very much appreciated. Unfortunately, due to time constraints and how far away it is something that I can only do 1-2 times a year. Therefore when an opportunity came to travel to home Mother's Day weekend I decided it was something that I needed to do. Thankfully I was able to request the weekend off from work and thus started to make plans. I then thought about some meaningful gifts that my mom might enjoy. When the work day finally ended on Friday I quickly went home and gathered up the items that I thought I would need for the weekend. It seemed like it took forever to do, but in reality probably only took a few minutes. I then drove several hours to my parent's place and arrived later that night. I was determined to make it in good time so only stopped once for gas along the way. However, it was late at that point we just talked for a bit before everyone went to bed. The next couple days though we went out and did some activities in town. We visited a couple new restaurants as well as one of the local parks.  It was neat to see how much my hometown had changed since I had grown up. The weekend went much too quick, but overall was very enjoyable and memorable."
