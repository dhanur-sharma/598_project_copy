I couldn't finish it and as I was walking around downtown heading to my car, a man was convinced that I was the lead singer of the sexdolls who played the night before. \"I wish! I said laughing.\" He said I looked just like him and that they put on a good show. It appeared we both were heading the same direction after that and I was very surprised when he said he wasn't convinced I'm telling him the truth - thats how much alike I must look to the lead singer of the sexdolls. I took it as a compliment even though I've no idea who they are or if they're even good. That's all I have to write.. I hope these shapes stop flashing soon. Perhaps I should give details. It was very hot outside and I hadn't showered that day, so my hair was not as poofy as I like it. This did not stop the man who was stricken with surprise. We had some nice small talk as well. I hope he's alright. Gonna give this three more sentences. Okay? Okay."
