        "Summarize the following story in first person: The beach was so nice.  I was dreading going because I have so much preparations to do in order to pack my family.  Going to the beach is not easy as my children wanted to vacation while we were there too.  This meant packing sand toys, blow up rafts, etc.  I always have to do all of my family's packing.  It is a challenge.  I ended up loving my time in Florida.  The wedding was gorgeous.  The bride and groom looked phenomenal.  We had great family time and saw family that live so far from us, we hardly ever get together.  It was like a big family reunion!  One night I just really wanted to get out and have some fun.  It had been all family time and with the children.  I just needed a break from the kids.  I talked my sister and several of my female cousins into going out on the town for the night.  We left our husbands and kids behind and bar hopped several places.  We drank more than we should and danced inappropriately, but hey!  Everyone needs to get out at some point.  This was my night.  It was the best time I had had in awhile, and I realized that I need to take more time for \"me\"."
