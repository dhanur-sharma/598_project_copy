        "Summarize the following story in first person: One of my more prouder and memorable moments I've experienced the last few months was when all three of my children went off to school for the first time this past September. My children are 10, 7, and 3 and they are entering the 5th, 2nd, and preschool grades. There was something that made my 'inner mom' proud to see my children growing and getting to that next step of not needing me anymore and wanting their independence instead. But at the same time, I felt like there was a sense of emptiness as they all eagerly skipped off to their bus. My older school-aged children was excited to see their friends after not really seeing them the entire summer and swapping stories on what they did and showing off their new clothes/school supplies. I was very happy for them and even secretly relived for them to get out of the house for a little bit. I was even more excited to hear about their day, their classrooms, their teacher, and the new friends they might have made! It was very cool to watch them grow up and I couldn't be more excited for them. However, the child that really made my heart sad was my three year old as he was starting school for the very first time. I most definitely took it a lot harder than he has as he did not even stop to say goodbye. Just watching that interaction made me realize that he is in such a hurry to move forward in his life and I am trying to hold back the leash, so to speak. I had a tough time letting go of the toddler stage and letting him go onto the preschool stage. It really was tough to see him SO happy to leave me while I stood back and watched him explore his classroom. Of course it was kind of tough not to take it very personal - I was hoping he was secretly wanting to stay with me... but he didn't. And then I realized that this is his first step towards independence and the very first steps towards the rest of his life. As he goes through different stages, he will always need me even if he doesn't show it. The last child is tough because that is 'your baby.' I will admit, however, having a few free hours to myself was amazing. After school was over, I picked him up and he was all smiles and he couldn't wait to do it again. It was then where I realized I did a great job raising a happy and secure child."
