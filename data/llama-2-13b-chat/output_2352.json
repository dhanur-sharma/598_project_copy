        "Summarize the following story in first person: The event that was memorable to me that had emotional markings was the death of my beloved pet. My one pet had died a few months earlier and since her death, I think my other pet just got lonely and depressed and sort of gave up on living. Her breed of dog had health issues, which she had, but she was managing. She was nearly sixteen years old and I could tell that last weekend of her life that she was going to die. I saw it before, just a few months earlier in fact. They stop eating and then stop drinking. I was hoping that she would recover, but I knew deep down that she wasn't going to. She had gotten so thin that final weekend. I was planning on taking her to the vet to have him take care of her...to get her out of pain. I didn't want to see her suffer and it wasn't fair to her. It was the weekend, so there was limited availability. I stayed up with her throughout the night and catered to her throughout the day. She slept a lot and I carried her outside when she asked to go out. That afternoon, she stood up on the couch to go outside. I took her out and put her down onto the grass. She looked up at me and I picked her up. I held her, stroked her fur, placed kisses on her head, and talked to her. She turned her head to the side, shook her head for a minute, and then I felt her heart stop and she was gone."

It was like she was telling me it was okay to let her go. I held her for a while, rocked her back and forth, and talked to her. I knew that she was gone and I didn't want to let her go. I knew that I would never see her again and it hurt so bad. I knew that she was suffering and that it was time to let her go, but it didn't make it any easier. I miss her every day and it has been a few years now. I wish that I could have her back, but I know that I can't. I know that she is in a better place and that she is happy and healthy now. I will always remember her and the memories that we shared. She will always be in my heart and I will never forget her."
