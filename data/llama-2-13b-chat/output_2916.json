        "Summarize the following story in first person: My ex and I still have no gotten back together. She still emails me telling me how poorly life is going for her and how her life is a mess without me. I feel bad for her but there isn't really a way back into my heart for her. Things that happen in our lives come with consequences. If you screw up in a relationship there can be forgiveness for certain things- but no forgiveness is promised for everything, and sometimes you can screw something up to the point where it is no longer fixable. She has been devoting herself to the protests in Hong Kong. She said she needs something in her life to focus on so that she isn't focusing on what she lost. That makes sense to me but she should focus on herself in my opinion. She has a lot of problems and those problems are holding her back from self actualization and self realization. I know she could be a special person but until she takes care of herself she will remain rough around the edges. I hope she finds someone nice in the future. I am scared that she will hurt herself because the reality of how she fucked up is hitting her. Sometimes I miss her, but I never miss the mental abuse. The language barrier was rough. I should probably date a native English speaker next."
