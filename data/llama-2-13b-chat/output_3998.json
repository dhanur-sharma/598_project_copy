        "Summarize the following story in first person: This has been a very interesting, roller coaster of emotion past six months. This year so far has been filled with very many ups and downs. At the start of the year, my dad had to have a procedure done because there was a chance he could have colon cancer. Thankfully, they were able to remove everything and the tests came back negative for cancer. So of course that was incredible news. Then, a month later, my sister discovers she is being diagnosed with stage 2 melanoma. She then goes in for a procedure, they were able to remove all of the tumor, and her test come back negative for anymore cancer. Again, incredible news. All the while that is taking place we are trying to plan and schedule our very first family vacation to Disney World. Family being, myself, my husband, our two daughter, my sister (who previously had skin cancer), and her family. We haven't see each other, my sister and I, in almost a decade so between no seeing each other and the cancer scare this trip will be very emotional for all of us. How did this effect me directly you might ask? Seeing my family go through such trauma made me stop and think about my own health. At the time, it was not good. I was severely overweight and had been diagnosed with arthritis recently. I was going down hill fast. Watching what my sister and my dad went through made me see that life is short and you have to take care of you and make yourself better, no one can do it for you. I decided it was time to change my life and get healthy. Within 6 months I can very proudly say I have list 50 pounds and feel the best I have ever felt!"
