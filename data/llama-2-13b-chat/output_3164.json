        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was contacted by text that my dad was very ill and would not go to the doctor.  The text was very surprising because I did not meet my dad until I was 12, when he had to come back to my state because his dad had died.  He would not come back into my life until I was 21.  He was in and out a lot then, never close.  I called my dad and I think I convinced him to go to the doctor and visited him in the hospital several day after that.  My husband and I traveled the one hundred miles to sit with him.  We shared some laughs, but a day after, I received a call that he was critical.  He had a wife that he had married 10 years ago (he was now 81) and a step-daughter.  I was asked about life support and what did I think would be his wishes.  That was hard to answer as I did not know him well.  There was three other children that he had that I did not know and I asked if they could contact them.  Apparently they did not get along with the \"new\" wife as their mom was now deceased, and refused to answer.  What ensued was many days of travel as I watched him slowly die over the next two weeks.  The decision to unplugged was decided by my step-mom and sister and I was notified almost a day later.  A funeral with no input but only from them whereas my family and many of his nieces and nephews attended only to be met with no body or urn present nor any acknowledgments of where the body ever rested."
