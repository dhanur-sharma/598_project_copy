        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 2 months ago I finally had my big break. I was working as a paralegal for the AD office despite having my degree. I needed to prove my worth and take on something big to get promoted or recognized for my efforts. When a slam dunk case against us was presented, it was passed off to me to see if there is any way to salvage it. There was a big suit against the city and we needed to see if there were any ways out of this jam. I went to talk to the construction crew that was suing the city over increased rates and as luck would have it, i ended up falling down at the construction site. I fell through two floors of scaffolding because part of the floor gave way. Through this i was able to get out unharmed but also an investigation was launched into the site. Apparently the contractor no longer had a license to build in the jurisdiction as he had previously cut corners and not been up to code. Had I not been there looking into it, many more people may have gotten seriously injured. On top of that the suit against us was dropped. And for icing on the cake we were able to counter sue. This was the break I needed and was recognized for my services. I finally got the promotion I had been seeking and now have a team that looks into cases for me. I love being able to prove myself even if it was blind dumb luck!"
