        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 6 months ago I was attending a house warming party for close friends along with my partner, Pat.   This party was taking place in a brand new home that was built in a very small and close-knit town.  As the night went on the party started to wind down and almost everyone had left.  Pat was going to find our friend in the backyard to say goodbye and I went inside to find our other friend to thank her and say goodnight, but she was already asleep upstairs so I went back outside and headed towards my car.  On my way down the dark driveway I was surprised to see a person pace down in the gravel. I got our my phone to use the flashlight and discovered it was Pat, and he was injured badly.  His head had a huge gash and he was bleeding and not very responsive.  I called 911 and gave the dispatcher all of the information I could, but I did not know the address, nor was I familiar with the town or any landmarks.  It took a long time for the paramedics to arrive, and when they started to treat Pat I was approached by 4 sheriffs who wanted to ask me questions.  I tried to give them as much information as I could, but since I was inside when the incident happened I really had no idea how Pat ended up in the state he was in.  Soon, the sheriffs started accusing me of assaulting Pat.  They questioned the homeowners who could not provide any information because one was asleep, and the other was at the far back side of their property cleaning up and putting out the fire we had going earlier.  Nobody heard or saw a thing.  So the natural conclusion for the officers was that I had a baseball bat and bashed in Pats face in the dark driveway.  I was treated like a criminal, and was not able to go with Pat to the hospital or even know what hospital they were taking him to.  Finally, with no evidence or baseball bat weapon to be found, the sheriffs let me go with a stern warning that the case was not closed and they would be watching me closely.  I found what hospital Pat was in, was able to speak to him after treatment, and found out that he had tripped on a tree root in the dark on his way to find our friend and hit his head on a rock.  The doctors and nurses even showed my the bits of gravel they had to dig out of his head.  From that night forward, and even still to this day, the sheriffs drive by my house continuously, often parking nearby and watching me as I go about my day.  It has affected me in a terrible way to be accused of something so awful and to made to feel I could be arrested at any time because of a made up theory that somebody decided must be true of me."
