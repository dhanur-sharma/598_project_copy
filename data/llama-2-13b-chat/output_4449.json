        "Summarize the following story in first person: The first day of vacation we left with high hopes of being able to be closer to each other, as it seemed we had been growing apart over the last year. We flew to Florida, and the excitement was palpable. We went straight to our room to change and then headed back out to the shopping district. I had a special surprise for him. I had booked as to do a Star Wars VR experience. It was so much fun and for the first time in a long time I was able to forget about the stressors at home and just relax and have fun as a couple. Then we went to lunch and had a few drinks. It amazing how fast you can reconnect when there are no outside forces to pull you out of the moment. That night we had a romantic dinner atop a restaurant overlooking the fireworks. It was like after one day we had rekindled what we had lost just by being able to shut out the outside world. It was the prefect way to start out vacation. It was like we were finally back to our old selves. We had let little things get in our way, but with those things far away back home, we could just focus on each other. I went to bed on cloud nine. And we went on to have a fabulous vacation."
