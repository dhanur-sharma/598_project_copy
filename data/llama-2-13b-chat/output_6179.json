        "Summarize the following story in first person: My family and I went on a trip to southern Utah to check out the rock formations and the unique environment. We brought our trailer house and we had plans to get to the campground in Duck Creek Village around 3 PM on the day of arrival. On our trip down, about 2 hours into the drive, we were in the middle of nowhere when the truck lost power and started making a horrible whining sound. We were on the interstate and had a max speed of 30 miles an hour. We were also in a one lane construction zone with no shoulder to pull off on to, so we were stuck on the freeway, 1 lane, cars piling up behind us, going 30 miles an hour. We reached the next exit nearly 45 minutes later. I had a couple tools in the trailer and opened up the hood to see if a spark plug cable or something had an issue. I couldn't find any obvious problems. I was completely perplexed. I then called the insurance company for a tow truck, but since we were so far from every city, it took 2 hours for a truck to come. We eventually had a tow truck reach us and towed the truck back the direction we came to the nearest dealership. It has been 72 days and the truck still is in the repair shop without any knowledge of what happened to it. We were able to borrow a truck from a relative that lived close by and got to the campground just after midnight that night. The trip went off without a hitch afterwards; we all had a great time. Southern Utah has some incredible and mind-blowing places."
