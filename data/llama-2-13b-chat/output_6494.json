        "Summarize the following story in first person: Well let me start off by saying that my family and I were very excited about the 4th of july event that was being held at our church. My wife had made her famous potato salad and I was going to be grilling the burgers for everyone. We arrived at the picnic and had everything setup and ready to go. People were showing up with their families and bringing the food they had prepared for the forth of july celebration. This was about six weeks ago and I remember it being very hot that day. I was watching the kids run around around and play and have a good time while my wife visited with the other couples that were at the celebration. I started grilling the hamburgers for the party I had it all setup the grill everything was cooking fine and you could probably smell the grill for about a mile or so. Thats when I herd one of the children say \"hey mama there is a bear over there\". I looked up to see a huge black bear making its way to the celebration. I grabbed some pots and pans that we were using to cook with and started banging them together to make a really loud noise. For some reason I remembered that from some show. Well this got everyone's attention and everybody came over to see what I was banging pots and pans at and saw the black bear running away. Everyone thanked me and we all had a good story to tell later. There was more to the story everyone was packing up to leave as we walked to the cars we all heard noises coming from one car. We all went to check it out and low and behold there was a black bear in somebodys car ripping it apart looking for food in the trunk. We had to scare that bear off also I felt bad for the people whos car the bear tore up."
