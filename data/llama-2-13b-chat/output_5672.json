        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was 6 months ago when we found out that my father got his cancer diagnosis.  I remember his coughs getting progressively worse and worse.  I was worried at the time.  At first I figured maybe it was just a cold, but it never got better.  I urged him to go to the doctor, but he never listened to me.  I wish I was more assertive about it.  It's bad now though.  Had he got the cancer diagnosis earlier, his treatment would have been manageable and he wouldn't be where he is today. I am going to make sure that I take care of my body.  If something doesn't seem right, I am going to go to the doctor about it.  It's good to catch things early.  I don't want to become like my dad, having to go through cancer treatment, just because I disregarded a cough.  Hopefully I never have to go through this kind of thing, but I realize that sometimes cancer runs in the family.  Cancer really sucks.  I pray that my dad gets better."
