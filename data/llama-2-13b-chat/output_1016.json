        "Summarize the following story in first person: When I bought my house 4 months ago, it was such a memorable experience. It took me so long to get ready to buy a house. I had to build my credit and change jobs. I had to get a job that paid more so that my debt to income ratio would be acceptable. This is why buying a house meant so much to me because I had to work really hard to get it. It was finally something that was actually mine. I felt like I had leveled up in life. So many people had doubted my ability to achieve this goal. The reality started when my offer was first accepted on the house. I could not believe this was happening to me and that I was actually starting. During the whole process I felt so many different emotions. I tried not to get too excited at first. I remember that I really did not want to discuss the topic with anyone. When I was signing the closing papers and being given the keys I felt such a huge weight coming off of my shoulders. I could not wait to finally go home."
