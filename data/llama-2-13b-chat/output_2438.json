I was just in my kitchen, baking some cookies for my grandchildren. They were supposed to come over later after their classes. I was so excited to see them, I love them dearly. It was after mixing all the ingredients, that I suddenly felt off. I began to feel some weakness and tingling in my arms, and my vision became a bit blurry. I needed to sit down before I passed out. After some time, I felt a bit better. I knew exactly what was happening to me, though. I had a mini stroke. A couple of years back, I had fallen off of a scooter when I was trying to teach my grandkids. That had led to a subdural hematoma, and I knew the risk of a stroke had increased. I needed to make my way to the hospital to get checked out, and I felt well enough to walk. Why pay for an ambulance ride that would cost me a lot of money? So, I walked to the hospital, which was not too far."

The scariest part of this all was that I was alone in the house when it happened. What if I had fallen and hit my head? Or what if I had passed out and no one was there to find me? It was a wake-up call for sure. Now, I have to be more careful and make sure someone is always with me. My grandkids will be home soon, and I can't wait to see them. I hope that I'll be okay by then.\n\n"
