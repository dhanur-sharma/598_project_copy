        "Summarize the following story in first person: I recently went to a live piano performance with friends that was absolutely breathtaking. Before this, I was not really that into listening to classical music or anything of the sort. Obviously, I was aware of such famous composers as Beethoven, but during this performance I was introduced to many new artists. One of my favorite pieces that was played is called \"Fantaisie Impromptu\", by Chopin. It really is impressive how fast the song is, and just the scale of notes that are played with both hands at the same time. Another great piece of music that was played is called \"Amoreena\", by Elton John. I was never a fan of Elton John, but I remember hearing his music in movies and thinking it always blended very well. This song stuck with me because the piano melody in it is very well executed. I never liked this song when I was a kid; but now, looking back it was more original than anything coming out now a days. One of the mysterious pieces I happened to enjoy was called \"Asturias\" by Isaac Albeniz. It reminded me of people running into a battle that nobody wanted to fight but everyone had to. When I first heard it, I remember thinking, how can someone think of making music like this? Well, The last piece of music I can remember hearing at this performance was Beethoven's \"Sonata No. 23\". As anyone would guess, it was a great piece of music, developed by one of the greatest composers. I can very much say that I am now permanently a fan of classical piano. I encourage everyone to seek out the great composers of the past, and find pieces of music they can assimilate with."
