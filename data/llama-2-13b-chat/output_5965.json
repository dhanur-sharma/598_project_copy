        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was April 30, 2019 and  I had a loaded morning.  First, I had to go a health science statistics class to deliver a presentation.  The presentation was a group project where we analyzed Wingate Test data.  I had done most of the project myself because I did not fully trust my group member, so I was quite nervous. Despite the problem, we did quite well, and it was reflected by the grade that we received later on.  However, at the time, I just knew that we stumbled a bit.  I then went on to a different building where I began to study for the more challenging task of the day - an anatomy practical and exam.  I had been studying ALL over the past week, which a much heavier emphasis on the prior weekend for these.  I needed a good grade here to maintain my 4.0 average (whereas my grade in my stats class was relatively safe).  I studied in this building from approximately 9:45 AM to just shy of 12:30 PM.  At this point, I headed up to the floor where my exams were and changed clothes (scrubs are a must in the anatomy lab).    After changing clothes, I went to the hallway just outside of the lab where classmates were starting to gather.  I sat down and studied just a bit more before the professors arrived.  Unfortunately, I did not make it into the first group of test takers (the practical only had around 10 stations and there were 16 students, so we had to be be split up).  This meant that I had to hang out in the hallway for a bit longer while the first group took exams.  While there, I studied and had a conversation with a girl about our dogs (we both have a dog named Darwin).  Finally, it was time for me to start the practical.  I went in, and had some uncertainties about a few of the stations that made me feel pretty miserable - I was certain that I was going to lose my A.  After the practical, we moved on to the written exam, where I was able to brood some more about my performance on the practical.  As I struggled through the exam (it was the hardest one yet), I just knew one thing - I was tired.  As I finished (with only one other student in the room), I slowly got up, walked to the teachers and turn in my exam before I left towards my car.  I had decided that I was going to to go to the store and get some wine.  On the way, I checked my phone and much to my surprise - they had already graded and posted to grades for the practical.  Contrary to what I had expected, I had done extremely well - my average was safe!"
