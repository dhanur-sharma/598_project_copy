        "Summarize the following story in first person: Recently, about 3 months ago I took on my largest cake order so far.  I run a small business fro home baking cakes, cookies, cupcakes and the like, until this all of my orders had been relatively small orders. It was for a dear friends brother's wedding, it was a large three tier cake, and I was nervous but I felt like I should take it on. The cake design its self was one that was difficult, square, which is difficult for me because in needs crisp edges, covered in handmade flowers, and wrapped in a black ribbon. The act of getting it to the wedding venue its self was gong to be stressful because it had to be transported in the heat of the summer in the south. I also felt that their wedding was a little unorganized but I felt that they were a great couple to do my first wedding cake fo rdue to the fact that they were laid back and very understanding people. I was so nervous, I started working as far ahead as I could and researched the best ways to transport and stack the cake. The day before I prepared the cake and had everything ready, and my nerves were a wreck. My husband and I laid down to go to bed, at three in the morning we got a phone call. My father in lay had a heart attack and was in critical conditions, my husband rushed to get his things together and make the drive 2 states away. So now I had to figure out how to pack me and 2 children and my husband enough stuff to last however long we might need to be there and deliver a wedding cake with 2 small children in tow. I was now officially a nervous wreck, I called the lady who was planning the wedding, and told her I needed to deliver the cake as early as I could, I packed all of our clothes, and the cake in the car with my 2 and 6 year old and headed towards the church. I managed to set up the cake and prepare it for the bride in 20 minutes and head towards my father in law. I had to leave the church before the bride was even able to come see the cake. I then drove 4 hours with two little kids to meet my husband. Thankful my father in law is on the mend but that was an extremely stressful day. The bride ended up being very happy with the cake as well and the wedding has gotten me several other orders."
