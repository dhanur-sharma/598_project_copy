        "Summarize the following story in first person: We were heading to a birthday party. The trip was supposed to take 2 hours, but ended up taking 3 hours because of the weather. We thought the bad weather would avoid us and stay to west of our location. Instead, the storm intensified and overtook us on the road. My husband was driving while I was paying attention to the weather app on my phone. Our three teenage sons were in the back seat. The oldest was particularly upset every time he saw lightning. It was slow driving at times because the rain became so heavy that it was difficult to see the road plus the other cars kept slowing down.         Once we arrived in the other city, we started to head to our destination, but took the wrong exit because we couldn't see the road signs. Our phones started beeping with an emergency alert. A tornado warning had been issued for the area we were in. My oldest son began to really panic. We pulled into a convenience store to determine if the tornado had touched down and where. We also wanted to see how close we were to the party location.        We stayed there for a bit until the radar on the weather app showed that the main part of the storm was well past us. My son had calmed down by this point. We got back on the highway and took the correct exit (which was the one right after the one we mistakenly took). Within minutes we were at the party place. We meet up with the rest of the group and watched one of the televisions in the place. The news coverage showed there had been a funnel cloud that touched down near where we were at. Every one was relieved to be safe inside. Once the sun came out and the storm warnings were canceled, my boys and the other teens played laser tag and raced go-carts. We were able to enjoy ourselves despite the stress and fear of the trip up there. The way home was much easier since there were clear blue skies and everyone was full of pizza and birthday cake."
