        "Summarize the following story in first person: One morning in early July of this year I woke up around 4 in the morning and began tossing and turning. This is quite normal for me. As most nights in the summer I sleep on my couch in the living room because that room has the best air conditioner. As I was tossing and turning I was woken up by what I first thought was a really severe menstrual cramp. I tossed and turned and laid in the fetal position.  The pain became unbearable and I decided I needed to get up. I was barely able to walk to the kitchen. I took a 500mg pain reliever and several tums. I still wasn't sure at this point what kind of pain this was. I just knew my lower stomach was in the worst pain I have ever felt. I tried to go back to sleep, but was unable to. Suddenly a wave of nausea hit me and I sprinted to my bathroom to throw up. I ended up throwing up twice and realized something was seriously wrong.  I ended up asking my dad to bring me to the emergency room around 6am in the morning. They immediately brought me in and got me hooked up to an IV. Based on my symptoms alone they couldn't figure out what was wrong so they did a CAT scan of my stomach and it turns out my appendix was inflamed. My appendix was in danger of rupturing at any moment due to how inflamed it was and needed to be removed immediately.  Within 30 minutes of this finding I was undergoing surgery to get my appendix removed. Had I not gone to the hospital when I did my appendix would of ruptured."
