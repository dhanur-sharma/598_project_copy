        "Summarize the following story in first person: Diary Entry - This week, my significant other and I drove to the airport to pick up my son. This was his first visit home after enlisting in the Army. I was so excited to see him and I was so relieved when he was finally sitting beside me in the truck for the drive home. I was so filled with pride when I saw my son in his Army uniform standing in the airport. He looked so grown up, more so than one would expect after just the passing of several months. I can tell just by how he stands straighter and taller, with his shoulders back and his chin held high, that he is proud of himself too. Starting in the truck on the ride home, I was so full of questions and so eager to hear about my son's experiences. I needed reassurance, as a mom, that my son was doing all right and that the Army was treating him well and fairly. Seeing my son looking fit and happy did a lot to give me this reassurance and to dispel the worries that I had been feeling after hearing of problems my son had been having with certain people during Basic Training. At one point, it looked uncertain he would even successfully complete the training. But now, seeing him, I knew everything would be okay. As my son shared his stories, he could laugh about some of those experiences with the perspective gained by the passing of time. Now, he was collecting his own stories, and I'm sure there would be more to come. I could laugh as well, instead of feeling the ache of wanting to protect my son from pain, emotional and physical. Seeing my son now gave me such hope for his future. It made me feel like everything would be okay, and helped balance the worries and headaches my son had given me as a rather troubled kid, drifting without any concrete goal in mind, after high school."
