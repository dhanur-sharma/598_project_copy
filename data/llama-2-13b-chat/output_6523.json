        "Summarize the following story in first person: What a surprise and shock to say the least.  I never would have thought in my wildest dreams that I'd ever have breast cancer.  After all, I'm a guy!  I always thought it was a woman's illness.  Until that day a few months back, gosh, I remember it so clearly.  I stepped out of the shower and was drying myself.  And there it was.  At first I thought it was an insect or bite.  When I felt closer and looked in the mirror I knew it was something else.  I kept touching it the whole night and my friend told me on the phone to get it checked out.  But we both didn't think it could be breast cancer.  Then, the doctor said those two words.  I was in disbelief.  I even asked him, but Doc, I'm a guy!  As if that would change things.  I'll never forget that wave of panic and fear that swept over me.  One minute I was on top of the world, the next, under it.  I felt like I couldn't walk.  Like I was less of a man.  I didn't even want to asknowledge it.  Still today, despite getting treated, I am in shock and despair.  I can only pray that it goes away and never comes back.  This unwanted lump of hell."

I will not let it take over my life.  I will fight it with all my might.  I will fight it with every breath I take.  I will fight it until the end."
