        "Summarize the following story in first person: On our way to our new living place we made two stops. The purpose of these stops was to sleep and rest before leaving again. Our first stop was in Ohio. After leaving Ohio and driving all day, we stopped Chicago during the evening. We had booked an AirBnB but for some reason it wasn't ready yet. We waited a while but were getting frustrated. We wanted to rest and were looking forward to relaxing because we were in the car all day. However, we also really wanted to get to Colorado, where we were moving. We were impatient and eager to get the rest of the trip over with so we decided to just leaved Chicago and keep driving until we got there. We took turns driving every couple hours so we wouldn't get too tired. The drive was really boring, especially since many of it was at night. The land driving through Nebraska is completely flat and tedious. Eventually we got there and it made everything worth it. I am glad we had the experience. Although, I would never make that drive again."
