        "Summarize the following story in first person: As I watch the interactions between my friend and his newborn son, I often think about the times he spent with his father growing up in the neighborhood and on the lake that we grew up on. Because my friend lives on that same lake and I get down there to visit on a regular basis, it's  as if things have come full circle for him. I remember watching his dad teaching him to swim and ice skate, both at very early ages. I can see my friend already indicating as well as making mention that he plans to follow in those same footsteps with his son. It gives me great satisfaction as well as pleasure. However it definitely makes me wish that I had children of my own. Fortunately I have MANY nieces and nephews that I am able to interact with on a regular basis. It's very rewarding and satisfying to watch each of them grow up and grow into each of their own skins. Because almost all of their parents are raising their children \"old school\", the kids are well behaved and we'll mannered which unfortunately seems to be the exception to the rule these days. Not sure why so many parents these days allow their children to make their decisions for them, yet alone speak to them in the manner in which they allow them to speak to them. It seems like they want to be their children's friends rather than their parents. That only works after the children have become adults. You must be enforce rules and consequences as their role models. Without them, children will lack the direction they require. Consistency is also key in child's life as they grow up. Fortunately I was raised by both my Mom and Grandparents so I received the proper upbringing necessary to become a respectful member of society. It is unfortunate that so many children I observe as they grow up, obviously haven't received the proper foundation they need. This leads many times to the inappropriate behavior displayed by these same children. If our society continues to progress in this direction, I believe that our society will suffer. Hopefully things will eventually get back on track."
