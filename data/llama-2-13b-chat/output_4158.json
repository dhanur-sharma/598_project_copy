        "Summarize the following story in first person: i prepared to teach my Bible lesson to my adult class buy studying today.  Even though I have spent over 30 years of studying 6 hours per week to teach adults the one hour class, I still am taught new things by the Holy Spirit as I study.  I encountered something that I found to be particularly touching today as I studied Acts 1:1-11.  The passage states that the book of Acts is about all that Jesus began to do and teach.  By verse 11, Jesus has already ascended into heaven, but this is still the beginning of what Jesus began to do and teach.  Subsequently, he will use the apostles and others who are called to preach to continue his teachings to the world. The apostles have spent the 40 days since Christ's resurrection learning how all of the Old Testament was about Jesus.  They were being instructed in the knowledge they would need continue to teach others.  Yet, they had been cowardly, scattering away from Jesus when he was crucified (except John who stayed).  So in addition to knowledge, they needed power to behave differently and that would soon come with the new ministry of the Holy Spirit introduced at Pentecost, 10 days after Jesus' ascension. But, in addition to knowledge, believers were advised to conduct themselves in a manner that could not be criticized (1 Peter 3:15-17).  Their behavior should adorn them.  That is what touched me.  The word adorn is so beautiful.  Most days I simply dress myself.  Yet, when I was dating, I would adorn myself with some cologne and my best shirt to be as attractive as I could be.  It touches me that the scripture urges be to adorn myself with righteous behavior.  It also convicts me.  I have studied and have a lot of knowledge of God through the Bible.  However, I still battle with my sin nature and often I am not adorned like I would like to be."
