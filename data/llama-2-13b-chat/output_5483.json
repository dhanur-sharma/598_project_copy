        "Summarize the following story in first person: I had planned to go and visit him for a few months prior.  We got in contact about it and set a date.  This happened about half a year or so ago.  He had some things piled up that he had neglected in his home that he needed help with.  But this was also the perfect opportunity to catch up with him and keep him company, since he's getting older now.  I arrived and he was extremely happy to see me, since we hadn't seen each other in a long time.  I loved seeing him as well.  When I got there we got straight to business to get everything done and out of the way, we both have the same personality so that made it easy to accomplish.  We sorted everything out and had a massive yard sale.  My grandpa made some good money on things he wanted to get rid of, which helped him fix up his house a bit.  After we finished the work it was good for us to relax.  We had lots of coffee everyday since he loves to talk and drink coffee.  We went out to lunch and dinner, we watched movies.  He loves the classics so he enjoyed sharing them with me (which I had never seen before).  Overall the trip was a huge success.  I'm actually going back out there soon."
