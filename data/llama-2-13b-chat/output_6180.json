        "Summarize the following story in first person: Gosh I feel accomplished. HP love craft has always been an inspiration of mine but I never dreamed I\u2019d be a writer. And now I wonder if I made the right decision sticking with the first publisher to come along. But I can\u2019t worry about that right now because I\u2019m a writer! Ah it\u2019s so exciting and My parents and wife are so proud of me. We went out to eat at a fancy restaurant the night I found out I was going to get a publication. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be on the best seller list or anything but fingers crossed. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen anything like this before we love it\u201d. It was incredible hearing that from someone with an unbiased opinion. I always am the type of person to doubt those closes to me. But now I have to make sure to keep it up. I\u2019ve already started brainstorming and writing down ideas for a new article maybe even a book! All this positive motivation has me feeling like I could do anything. There\u2019s a lot of nervous anxiety sprinkled in but that\u2019s normal. I hope to have a rough draft written up by next month and see what they think. Well, time to break out the story board! Wish me luck!"
