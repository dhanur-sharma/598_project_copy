        "Summarize the following story in first person: This past summer was really challenging for me. My teenage daughter wanted to visit friends that live in California. I wanted to say no and that it was too far away from home. Deep inside I knew that this would be a great experience for her to see new things and the friends she would stay with were really good people. I was worried in the beginning about her being in the airport and changing planes but she did it all with no problem. She stayed for 6 weeks and had so much fun. She visited all the major sites in Hollywood and even went to Disneyland. It was hard not having her at home when I'm used to seeing her everyday. I didn't have anyone to take care of on a daily basis and that was weird for me. I missed her laugh and her smile. I missed her company everyday. I thought she would be so busy and glad to be away that I wouldn't hear from her much. I thought I would be the one trying to get a hold of her to check in. I was very surprised when that wasn't the case. She was texting me from the time she was in the airport and everyday after that. Sometimes she would text me several times a day to tell me what they were doing. She really wanted to share everything with me and even ask my advice sometimes. It just felt so good to know that she still needed me. I feel better about her leaving for college next year and I know I won't be forgotten."
