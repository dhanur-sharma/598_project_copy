        "Summarize the following story in first person: It has been such a whirlwind these past 8 months.   Michael and I have had so many exciting things happen to us it's hard to know where to start!  In April of this past year, my wonderful life partner surprised me with a flash mob wedding proposal.  It was such a surprise and we were able to get it all on film.  It has become one of the most watched wedding proposals of 2018 on YouTube.  After Michael proposed we got to work straight away on all of the details.  We both wanted a small intimate wedding at our favorite Catholic Church.  We made an appointment with Father Francis and started our 6 month wedding prep classes.  They were so informative and we really enjoyed them.  We made some new friends and a few of them even came to our wedding!  We planned an exotic honeymoon to Tahiti and are leaving next week.  We are staying for 10 days and 10 nights.  It's always been a dream of ours to go somewhere exotic, and we have been able to save up enough money to pay cash for our honeymoon!  We found a quaint little apartment and have furnished it with some furniture that our parents have donated to us.  We plan to have our first family get together as soon as we are home from the honeymoon.  Life is bliss and I couldn't be happier!"
