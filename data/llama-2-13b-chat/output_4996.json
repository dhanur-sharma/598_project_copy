        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was feeling anxious that day. I went for a bike ride to the place I usually go. When I got to the park, I looked over at the bench next to the parking garage; it was empty. I decided to go there. The bridge across the creek to that place had children on it though, with their mother. They weren't really paying attention. I rang my bike bell to let them know I had to get through, the mother seemed concerned. The children got out of the way but to opposite sides of the bridge. I carefully biked past them very slowly. Simultaneously there was a group of bikers coming in the other direction. They slowed down to stop, and I crossed past them. The intersection was right after the bridge, and required a left turn from me to get where I was going, so I had to go in front of them. I went slightly before they came to a total stop, and didn't signal, because to signal I would have to take a hand off the handlebars and I was worried about losing control with so many people in all directions. The bikers were upset, because they seemed to think I should have signalled, or waited for them to pass. I honestly hadn't considered it, even though I didn't have right of way, I always make that turn without stopping, and having just navigated the bridge with all those children on it I was distracted. I ignored them."
