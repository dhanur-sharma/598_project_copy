        "Summarize the following story in first person: So, we were at the hospital expecting the birth of my second Daughter a month ago. My Mother was staying at my house with our first daughter. While she was there, she stole and pawned much of my wife's jewelry and my power tools. Needless to say, she's not coming back. I'm done with her crap. This whole thing has made me re-evaluate my life's priorities and how to protect myself and my family from those I shouldn't have to be protecting it from. I have to shut out my birth family in order to protect my wife and children from their influence and from being victimized by them in any untold ways they might dream up. This whole thing has really sucked. I shouldn't have to worry about stuff like this. This is what my life has been like from the beginning. There's been a history of lies told to me since birth. I didn't even know where I was born for 30 years. It's a shame that people can't love their own child enough to take care of them. If my Mother had just been decent to me this wouldn't be an issue. It's over now, but sheesh."
