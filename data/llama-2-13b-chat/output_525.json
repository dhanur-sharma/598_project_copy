        "Summarize the following story in first person: The event was a death in my family. It was an unexpected death, and was someone who meant so much to me. Someone whose death left a hole in my heart and life. The most surprising thing was the death itself. It was not expected and came out of no where, and caught me by surprise and off guard. It was a day, I will never forget. I lost the one person I could always go to. You never get over a death like that. No matter how old you get, you will always need your mom.  I hate that my daughter does not get to grow up with her, and that they are both missing so much of each others lives. It has changed things significantly for me, and is something that will never be easy to live with. My every day has changed, and I still go to text or call her. I hate that I can't, and can't share what is happening in my life. I miss her so much. I can't bare the thought of not having her in my life. It is so hard, but time does allow for it to become your new normal, and you learn how to live with it."
