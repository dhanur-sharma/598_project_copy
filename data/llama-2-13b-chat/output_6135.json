        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last month a friend of mine passed away. We had been close since the age of 7 when we met in the first grade. When I heard the news that she was gone, I almost couldn't believe it. It didn't feel real. It still doesn't. I feel like I could call her now and she would pick up, but the realization hits me that that can no longer happen. Waves of sadness, grief, and despair come over me. I remember the last time I spoke with her. It was a strange encounter, at the store, as we usually meet at each other's homes. That was the first, and last, time, I'd ever ran into her. She seemed to have a light shining behind her, and I distinctly remember that when I looked at her, it was like no one else was around. She seemed so healthy, so happy. What had gone wrong? Why couldn't I have helped her? I just didn't know anything was wrong inside of her. Her passing showed me that I need to reach out more to others and help them if I feel like I should. I need to ask how they're doing more often or just offer to come see them and be more friendly. When I think back on our long conversations, I never remember her seeming like she needed more. I realized after her death that sometimes you have to just offer more, even if the person doesn't ask for it, because you never know just how much they need."
