        "Summarize the following story in first person: 3 months ago I was teaching math and science at my new job and I began noticing the way one of the children was being treated by a particular group of boys. This kid is Asian and the other boys were making comments about his race but it was obvious that they were mostly intimidated by him because he consistently outperformed them in the class. This boy was a excellent student in both math and science and and he was also getting all A's in his other classes . The boys that were picking on him spent much of the their time in class goofing around and it was a daily struggle to get them to do their work. There were 4 boys in particular that seemed to spend quite a bit of time together and not much was spent focusing on their school work. I began to notice that they would be especially disruptive and bully the boy when it was close to test time and I was working to prepare the class. It seemed that since they were not doing well in the class that they felt the need to disrupt the entire class and be especially mean to the boy that was leading the class. I began speaking to the boys individually about their behavior and tried to get them to see how they were behaving and to instead focus on their schoolwork. The asian boys parents came to talk to me about the behavior as their son was hurt by the way he was being treated. The parents said they were concerned and asked that the school discipline the group of boys that were bullying their son, I again spoke with the group of boys , mostly individually to let each of them know that they should be focusing more on their school work and that what they were doing was not kind and instead hurtful. I could tell they understood , some more than others at first but it seemed that this approach began to make a difference as I began noticing each of them become more thoughtful and less concerned about how much better the boy they were bullying was doing than them in the class. I began offering tutoring to anyone that wanted extra help and one by one each of the group of bullies began asking for help. They had become aware that they were jealous and simply needed to work harder. I noticed that he boys began to respect the asian boy and instead of being being negative they began to show interest in learning. It seems they realized that just because they were not as far behind as they felt and that if they just began working harder they too can understand mathematics and science. It was especially rewarding when it was time for the science fair and each one of the group of boys that began the year as bullies were instead some of the most excited in the class to participate in the science fair."
