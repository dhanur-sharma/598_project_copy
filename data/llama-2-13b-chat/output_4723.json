        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was so completely humiliated at my sister in laws wedding. My son was being an absolute monster. I have never been so embarrassed. I expect the occasional outburst, he is only 5, but I never expected anything like this. He was being good all morning. He got dressed without a fight, he even let me comb his hair for once. I explained to him how important this wedding was to everyone, he seemed to understand. That all changed the second we walked into the church for the ceremony. We sat towards the front and the procession started. As soon as my sister in law walked into view and started  coming down the aisle my son started screaming. Not a regular little cry, no he was screaming like he was being murdered. I quickly covered his mouth with my hand, but that only made it worse. He bit me, which caused me to scream out a very loud curse word. Everyone in the church stopped and stared at me. My son, acting like a possessed animal, kept screaming and crying. I glanced at the brides father, who was midway down the aisle with his daughter, and he was giving me the more horrifying look. He looked like he hated me more than anything he had ever hated. I quickly left the church with my son and calmed him down. We sat outside until the ceremony was over. Afterwards everyone walked out and just stared at us. The brides father and stepmother walked right past me without even returning my hello, I was humiliated."
