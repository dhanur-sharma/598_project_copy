        "Summarize the following story in first person: In the spring instead of packing my son's college apartment up and bringing him home, I was instead packing up his apartment to send him to a new part of the country.  He was starting his life, with a career and a new apartment in the opposite side of the country from me. I could not get myself to say goodbye. I just hugged him and left all the while silently crying as I got to my car. My heart was aching and I knew that my son had grown up and would now longer need his mother. He was going to take care of himself. Although I was happy for him, I was aching for me.  I was thinking about all the time that I would not be able to physically see him. I had to tell myself that I would not make a scene and cry uncontrollably in front of him. I did not want to make him feel bad for leaving. I was about his age when I left my Dad and move to a different part of the country. When I left my Dad was crying so much that it made me feel bad. I didn't want my son to feel the same way. I guess I was being selfish but I was trying my best not to make a scene. And although I did not cry in front of my son, I did cry in the car on our ride home. I think I made my other son sad and that was just as bad."
