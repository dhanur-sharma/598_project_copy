        "Summarize the following story in first person: Dear Diary,What a time I've been having since I last wrote! I finally have a chance to tell the story, and what a story it is! About a month ago, I was driving home. You know that road right past the freeway entrance? The small side road I take to avoid the light at the end of the main road? Well, I was going down there, and apparently a deer mistook my car for a doe or something, because there he came, running right out of the woods straight at me! I'm no killer, so of course I swerved to avoid hitting the poor misguided fellow. Unfortunately for me, I swerved right into the yard of this nice old couple, who thankfully didn't have the time or energy to fix the ditch at the front of their yard. That beautiful ditch was the only thing that came between me and serious injury! It enabled me to slow down enough to stop. When I did, oh boy, was I eager to get out of that car! My heart was pounding so hard I thought I would die right there! The male half of the old couple ran out, and checked to make sure I was ok, bless his heart. Just some soreness, I told him...and a totaled car that I was pretty sure was going to chew up my insurance deductible. \"No worries, son\" said the old man, \"I'm a retired auto body guy and can do it for you for the amount the insurance pays and no more!\"I am so so grateful! Not only did I live to tell the tale, but I also managed to get my car fixed for no out of pocket cost. Well, diary, I'm off to buy some anti-deer whistles for the car. Hope they work! Max"
