        "Summarize the following story in first person: I recently moved to a new house. This was a big deal  in my life. I had previously struggled to find an affordable place to live while I am in the process of saving money to pay off debts. I had just moved the previous year into a new home with a close friend, and having a roommate was saving me roughly $100/mo versus my expenses living alone in the smaller apartment I moved from. Unfortunately, after only living together a few months, my roommate, who was only 19 at the time, decided he wasn't ready to live on his own, and opted to move back in with his parents. His parents took him back without any problems, but this left me in the unfortunate position of not having the money to cover all of the expenses associated with moving, but also not earning enough every month to cover my expenses living in the 2-bedroom apartment alone. At first, I struggled to find a new roommate, but I was living in a rural location that was not very enticing to any of my similarly-aged single friends, who seek to live in an urban environment with nightlife. I then negotiated with my landlord for slightly cheaper rent in exchange for maintaining the property for him. I did things like mowing the grass and cleaning the other units in preparation for new tenants, and he took $100/mo off of my rent. This helped, but it didn't leave me any free time because I was constantly working or doing side jobs to earn extra income, taking care of the large property by myself, or cleaning my own large apartment. However, just a few months ago, a good friend of mine told me that he had a small house which he had been renting, but he was now preparing to sell. He thought it would be beneficial for me to have a cheap place to live, and it would be beneficial to him if he could sell the home to someone who would maintain it as a rental property. He allowed me to move in at a rental rate that was $200/mo cheaper than my current rate including my $100/mo discount. In addition, he waived the security deposit so that I could move in immediately. When he sold the home, I locked in my low rent with the new owner indefinitely with a year-to-year lease that automatically renews. I also pay less for utilities such as electricity because the home is smaller, and the internet providers here are cheaper than they were in my old apartment. Overall this has left hundreds more dollars in my pocket every month which I am now being able to use to dig myself out of debt faster."
