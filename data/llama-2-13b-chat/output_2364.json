        "Summarize the following story in first person: One significant event that has happened to me in the last six months was staying in Europe for 3 months. We first arrived in the Czech Republic, Prague. We arrived in the evening and because it was winter, the sun went down sooner. I had never been to Europe before and we went out in the dark onto one of the busiest parts of the city and I remember it being unlike anything else I had ever seen before. They were roasting meat on sticks. There were foreign pastries every way you looked. The sidewalks were made out of bricks that were laid hundreds of years ago. People were sitting on the steps of castles casually eating their sour kraut. We walked out into the square and I remember looking up at the old buildings and beautiful architecture. I had never seen buildings that old in America. It started snowing in that moment and I remember it being one of the most beautiful memories I have ever had. It was something out of a dream. My kids and I held hands and walked together. I am glad I got to experience something like that. I am interested in writing about this story in further detail at a later time."
