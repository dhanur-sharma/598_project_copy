        "Summarize the following story in first person: My sister Jenna turned 20 this week! This is her last birthday before she leaves for the military so we wanted to make a big deal out of it and do something fun. Jenna has always loved animals so we thought it would be a good idea to take her to the zoo. My parents planned a surprise trip to the zoo for all of us. We spent the entire day walking around and seeing the animals, it was really nice. My sister was very happy. Afterwards we went to her favorite restaurant. It is a really good italian food place that has the absolute best meatballs on the planet. Everyone ate until they couldn't fit anymore food in their stomachs. After that everyone headed back to my parents house. When we got there some of our other relatives showed up. My parents had ordered a big custom cake from a local baker. My sisters favorite animal is the elephant, and they got the cake shaped like a giant elephant. It was a really cool looking cake, and it tasted even better than it looked! My sister looked so happy to be spending her last few weeks at home with everyone she loved.  It was a great day, and since it is probably one of the last big gatherings with her for a while, it is something I will remember."
