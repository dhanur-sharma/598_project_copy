        "Summarize the following story in first person: Three months ago, my old faithful friend, Arwen was unable to get up out of her bed.  She had lived a very active, long life.  We spent our free time going to the park and hiking along the shady paths along the lake.  For sixteen years, we had been inseparable, enjoying weekend excursions.  She loved to run along the quiet paths where we hiked.  She would bark at butterflies and chase falling leaves! I knew she loved the outdoors, so I helped her and carried her outside to lay on her favorite cushion on our sunny deck to take in the morning breeze.  She wagged her tail and laid her tired head on my kneee as I sat beside her.  She did not want to eat anything that I offered.  I had called before we went outside and had an appointment at her vet.  I carried her to the car and placed her on her favorite blanket.  I knew that she would not be coming home again, and I wanted this to be as easy on her as possible.  Although it made me sad to say goodbye, I knew it was time for her suffering to be over.  Although this was a sad morning for me, I am so thankful that we had our time together. Arwen, I will never forget you!  You made a huge impact on my life!"
