        "Summarize the following story in first person: My coworker and I went to a local bar after work.  We hung out at the bar for a bit talking and having a good laugh.  We saw some cute girls walk in and walk to the other end of the bar.  We smiled at them and eventually made our way over to them after watching them for a bit to see if anyone was with them.  We ordered them drinks and paid for them. We got them some small appetizers too.  We laughed for hours and chatted about everything under the sun.  I really liked the one girl who had dark hair and dark eyes.  She was a beauty and a bit mysterious.  She carried herself well and had a pretty dress on.  We talked about our dogs.  How we both love animals.  I could tell she had a gentle spirit about her.  Come to find out she knows my cousin.  They work together at the hospital.  I could tell she liked me and was touching my arm here and there. My coworker had to leave so I invited the girl back to my place to hang out and talk some more.  We ended up talking all night long.  We both had to get up and go to work but went out that next night again.  Here it is 5 months later and we have been together as a couple for four months.  We go out and hang out just about every single day."
