        "Summarize the following story in first person: One of the happiest days of my life happened 2 months ago, Spencer finally proposed! We had been talking about it, but he gave me no indication he was ready to pop the question. We have been dating for about 1 year and things were going great. We like the same things, we have learned to agree to disagree. We had asked me about the kind of ring I would like to have if we were to get engaged and I told him, I actually showed him, lol! He didn't expect that. When he asked me that question, I thought, ok , this is it! He must be getting ready to ask me on Valentine's Day. I already knew what my answer would be, but I was wondering how would he do it. So, Valentine's Day comes and goes and still no proposal. We did go out to dinner, so I was starting to wonder what was going on. I knew he was going to ask me, but at this point, I didn't know when or how. So, I waited and waited. Every now and again I would throw out little hints. I made sure to send him a picture of the ring, so he would always have it.  Finally, it happened. One day while we were driving through the city going to a new restaurant that opened on the wharf. We get there and we're both looking out at the water and he drops down on one knee and POPs the question. I said YES, before he ever put the ring on my finger!  Now, I'm actually glad he didn't do it on Valentine's Day, because now we have our own special day!"
