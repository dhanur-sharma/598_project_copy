        "Summarize the following story in first person: The event that was most memorable and striking to me within the last few months was graduating with my teaching credential and master's degree. This is something that I have been dreaming about for years. It was something that I worked on for years by taking tests, writing papers, and attending classes. There were countless nights studying and worrying. Student teaching was long and expensive since I had to pay to not work. It was also exhausting working full-time and then taking classes at night. To finally be done with my credential and master's was a huge accomplishment for me. Walking down the stage at graduation felt amazing. I realized that this was likely the last time that I would attend a graduation as a student. That is, unless I decide to go back for my doctorate degree. However, whether I decide to go back for another graduate-level degree or not, the accomplishment of getting my master's degree can never be taken away from me. My parents and grandparents were extremely proud. My long-term boyfriend was extremely proud. I realized that the next time I attend a graduation will likely be for my students, since I am trying to teach high school level students. It feels nice to pass the torch to them."
