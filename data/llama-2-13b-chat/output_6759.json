        "Summarize the following story in first person: What a great day this July 4th was spending time with the family while on vacation in Texas. Today started off the same as normal with coffee and breakfast. My brother in law which I call my brother always treats us well.  Then we had to get ready for today's big BBQ.  This is what I was looking forward to. You see we live in California so we do not get many holiday's with immediate family on my husband side.  Texas is where his parents, brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts, and so many more. Our child got to have a fun filled holiday with everyone, especially her grandparents.  Everyone came, there was so many people there that we love and cherish.  I got to meet a lot of new family members.  What makes this the best was my child got to spend time with her family. I will always remember this day because this is the day that I felt more welcomed into this huge family.  Great food with great people and some fireworks at the end. This is one of the best July the 4th's ever.  I hope to have many more holidays with our family."
