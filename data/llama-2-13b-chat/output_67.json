        "Summarize the following story in first person: I can't believe it's been four months already.  FOUR MONTHS.  I mean, it started so badly, you know? Internet dating is one thing, but \"finding random person on Craigslist\" sounds like the beginning of one of those murder/investigation shows on television, but no. She was a real person who just wanted someone to go to a concert with her so she wouldn't have to go alone. Emily's cool, though, so no \"my wife is an axe murderer\" here.  Not that I probably wouldn't deserve it, but I won't complain.  I mean, I ruined the concert and she's already forgiven met--it's not like I could have predicted the stomach flu, but I probably could have managed not to puke on her shoes--and she was awesome about things when the tire went flat.  She was like Superwoman, swinging the tire iron around like she knew exactly what to do with it (even though she told me she'd never changed a tire before.) I don't think I could have written a worst first date.  Maybe accidental broken bones or a trip to the ER, but puke and flat tires run a close second. Thinking too much about that feels like tempting Fate, though. It's probably silly, but I found tickets to see that band she likes so much again.  They're finishing up their tour and they'll be in Chicago.  I think I'm going to surprise her with a weekend trip. Hopefully neither of us ends up sick this time. I'd really like to be able to take her to a nice \"6 month anniversary\" dinner.  She totally deserves it."
