        "Summarize the following story in first person: Three months ago I found out I was pregnant. I was so nervous. I already have four children, will I be able to show all of them equal attention and afford everything? I have all sons and I would really love to have a daughter. I can not wait to find out the gender. I really hope it is going to be a girl. I am so excited to find out the gender but I am also nervous. I will still love the child if it is a boy though. I know gender should not matter but it would be a nice change if it was not a boy. Hopefully my other children get a long with the new baby coming. It will be hard to give equal attention after the baby is born. I think they would like having a sister. I bet they would be very protective of their sister if they were to get one. If it is a boy I am sure they will still love the baby just as much. I can hardly wait for the gender."
