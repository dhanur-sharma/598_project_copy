        "Summarize the following story in first person: I will never ignore workplace safety training seminars ever again. Today was an ordinary day at work, with the only exception being that we had our monthly meeting that day. Everyone was to meet in the warehouse, and we all were to report there at a certain time. I usually like to arrive early, because if I were to arrive on time, that's when most people will be arriving and if I come late, that just looks bad on me. So, I sped through my lunch and went off to go to the meeting. Then, it happened. I was on my way to the meeting when I saw some water on the floor. I have ADD, so immediately, I wanted to go and get something to clean it. After going to the bathroom to get some towels, my mind jumped from one thing to another, and I realized I had to go to the bathroom. I stopped to go, and then realized I was now late to the meeting. In my hurry out, I completely forgot about the water I saw. I was hustling to get to the warehouse, when suddenly I feel myself slip in the very water I was supposed to clean. Luckily the damage wasn't too bad, but boy did it hurt. I don't think I've ever felt pain like that on the job. I am definitely lucky that it wasn't worse, but I'll never forget to wipe up a mess I see again."
