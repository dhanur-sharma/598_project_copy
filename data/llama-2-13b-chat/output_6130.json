        "Summarize the following story in first person: The most memorable event that happened to me took place in mid-May. I flew with my oldest daughter from Detroit to suburban Phoenix. She was starting her first job post graduation as an elementary school teacher. This was striking to me as a mom because I thought she would be excited to be starting a new life.  We had such a good time setting up her new house, buying furniture and unpacking.  It all seemed to be going well until she broke down in tears.  I was distraught as she sobbed that she didn't want to be there, that it was too far away from home. I tried (in vain) to be encouraging. I told her to think of it as a new adventure.  I held her as she wept, soothing that it was time for her to be on her own and that I knew she would be successful. I believed she had a heart for kids and that this was her vocation.  She SAID this was what she always wanted, but the reality of it was just too overwhelming.  To be honest, as much as I love my daughter, I don't get it.  I would have killed for such a great opportunity at her age.  She was being given what she said she wanted, and there she was a total wreck! I think about this event often and it's something that I mull over on an almost daily basis. I continue to be surprised, shocked and a little pissed when I consider the situation.  I hate the term \"adulting\"; it's not a verb I used.  But my daughter was not coping well at almost twenty-five. I have to wonder how this happened. I have always been attentive, but stressed that I expected her to stand on her own two feel and to be a strong, independent young woman.  I have done my level best to be the best I could as a mother to all my children. Most of them are hanging in there, but I wonder how to help my eldest who is chronically dissatisfied. I struggle to get her to live in the present and to look at the bright side. I do the best I can."
