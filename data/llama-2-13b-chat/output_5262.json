        "Summarize the following story in first person: I found out that my uncle Jack's death may have been prevented.  I wasn't even born when he died.  He died over 30 years ago and, but I am disturbed with what I have learned.  He was my mom's little brother and she adored him.  She still cries when she thinks about him and his death.  He was sick with a high fever but my grandfather refused to let a doctor care for him.  He thought the illness would run its course and Jack would be fine.  Well, Jack died at the young age of 15 years old.  My grandmother was racked with guilt about not being able to get her son medical help because of her husband.  She finally told Mom about it last night.  The family is stunned but also feels terrible that my grandma has carried this around with her for so many years.  Mom is okay, I guess.  I think she is very sad and wonders the, \"what ifs,\" but you can't linger on that.  We have to support and nurture Grandma right now and let her know no one blames her.  I so feel for her and want her to be relieved of the pain she is in and has been all these years."
