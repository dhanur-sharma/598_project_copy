        "Summarize the following story in first person: Dear Diary, I quit my comfortable job as an engineer 2 months ago to go a pursue my passion: snowboarding. I thought I had it all figured out with my job but after a couple years I realized that I do not really like engineering. The realization of that hit me really hard because it turns out that I was just doing it to fulfill someone else's expectations. It was never something I really wanted but it was something that I thought I wanted because I was worried about my status and ego. Now, neither of those things are important to me. Money is not even a motivation for me anymore. All I care about is achieving happiness in my life and to get out of the rat race that is called work. I kept looking at everyone in my office and thought that I needed to get out of here. Life was so mundane. I decided to pack up my car with all my essentials and I drove out to Colorado to try to become a snowboard guide. The beginning has been an emotional rollercoaster with thoughts like \"am I making a good decision?\" and \"How will I keep myself alive?\" bumping around in my head. As I waved goodbye to my parents I started to feel extreme sadness. I drove across country from the east coast to Colorado on a 5 day rode trip. I am now settled down a little bit in Colorado with some support from friends. As soon as I got to this great state, I knew I had found the right place for me. I know I have a long journey ahead of me but I think back and am glad that I am here and not still in my comfortable job."
