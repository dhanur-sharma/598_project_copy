        "Summarize the following story in first person: I recently moved back to a big city to look for a job after a few years.  After graduating grad school in this particular city I had moved upstate.  However last month I packed my suitcase and came back to the same city to look for a job.  I came back for a few reasons, one being better career opportunities but also to connect with my friends.  I stayed over at a friends apartment for a few weeks while trying to land job interviews.  There I rediscovered our friendship from years ago.  We both went to college together and it was heart warming that despite years of not really communicating other than facebook messaging we got a long pretty well.  It was almost a comforting sign.  It was like the universe showing me positive signs that I might be on the right path.  For a few years I was unsure of where I should be.  However coming back to the city and meeting with old friends showed me how much I felt at home here.  Right now I am working a temporary job to hold me over.  However I really pray that I will find something stable here and am able to live and work here again.  Although the city has changed I still love it.  Finally I realized this is where I want to be."
