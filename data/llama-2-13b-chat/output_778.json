        "Summarize the following story in first person: On July 4th, I was admitted to Kaiser Hospital in Los Angeles while suffering what turned out to be a heart attack. It has begun the previous day and the uncomfortable feeling just didn't go away.  At 3:30 AM, I drove from the San Gabriel Valley to the facility, about 15 miles away.  My friends still think I was nuts and my family agreed, saying that this apple did not fall far from its tree, seeing that my dad did the same thing when he had his heart attack at 65.  While at the emergency ward, I began to get suspicious and came up with this conclusion:  the more different doctors visit you in a two hour period, the more serious the condition.  For the next few hours, I was prodded, tested and sent to another hospital where two stents were inserted to make the \"widow maker\" work better (it was 90% blocked).  Within a few days, I was released. However, the world I knew for 61 years changed with those three days.  Probably the greatest challenge wasn't so much the junk food that consumed this average baby boomer so much as the time I had to take to make that work.  Seasoning food without salt takes creativity. Substituting fruits and whole wheat involves careful planning at a store.  If i eat out, I have to check the menu more carefully to eliminate anything with too much sodium, or with processed sugar.  In short, this new diet demands attentitveness, something I ignored when it came to health, but didn't when it came to work.  I'm not through though.  In a few weeks, I have to meet with a cardiac surgeon.  Yeah, bypass.  That means a few months recovery at a time where I don't think I have the strength or resources to fully get back on my feet.  But I have friends and family and my own tenacity.  I can prepare a salmon, I can rise up from however many bypasses they have to put in."
