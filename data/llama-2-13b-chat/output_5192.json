        "Summarize the following story in first person: My wife and I decided it was time to have a kid so we did. We had our gender reveal party. I actually prefer to call it a genital reveal party, because that's what it really is. Gender doesn't perfectly correspond to sex in the way more traditionally minded people in western culture think it does. Also, it's just as likely that your kid is intersex as it is that they have green eyes, but we don't insist there are only brown eyed people or blue eyed people. But my wife and I are dumb and uneducated Trump supporting types, so we ignored all of that complicated stuff and decided that the genitals of our child will determine like 90% of it's life. We will assume all kinds of things about it, and we will have a gender reveal in order to invite those assumptions from out friends and family so that they can also participate in conditioning this baby to conform to whatever the relevant norms are for people with those genitals. We had the reveal and it was great. It turns out my baby has a vagina. It's weird when I say it that way, but is that not all I'm communicating when I tell you that it's a girl? If it seems weird that I would excitedly announce that my baby is going to have a vagina, you're the weird one not me. You're weird for thinking that's weird. Why would we not celebrate genitals? Genitals are wonderful. I love genitals."
