        "Summarize the following story in first person: I can't stop thinking about going to Raindance Casino with Gary, even though it was seven weeks ago. So I just want to write down everything I can remember about it, for my journal. We were meeting for lunch there. We went to the buffet, which was awesome. It really is the best buffet I have ever seen. There were two different types of chicken, and both were excellent. I see why he eats there all the time. So then, normally he would go play blackjack. But he took me around the casino and showed me all the stuff going on. I thought it was hilarious to see everyone being so intense. I can't believe I won at roulette! I just wanted to try it! It seems like the best strategy is to bet it all at once on the even odds. So I bet all $50 on black and won!  Then I watched Gary play blackjack for a while, and then I just walked around and looked at everything and watched the people. Some homeless-looking guy won a big payout from a slot machine. The slots were just crazy! There were all kinds of people at the slots. There was a guy in a suit that looked like an attorney or something. And it seemed like there were so many people that worked there that were just running back and forth incredibly busy. It was like a shopping mall except there was something nuts about it! It really was exciting. Then I met up with Gary again, and he'd won a couple hundred dollars so he was happy. Even the cashing out experience was so funny, like being in a movie. I don't know if I want to go again, though."
