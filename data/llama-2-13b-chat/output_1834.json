        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was five months ago that I got the call. The call that would change my life forever. The call where the woman on the other end of the line said \"you're hired.\" It's been 17 years. 17 long years since I had to set an alarm in the morning. 17 years since I had to eat breakfast, brush my teeth, and leave the house while the sun was coming up.  After I hung up, I raced out to get my gear. The recommended equipment. A pair of sunglasses. Sunscreen. Gloves. Comfortable shoes. A baseball cap. All the things required to be a sign twirler. They said it's a dangerous world out there. Out there on the corner. But I told myself \"I'm going to be ready.\"  I've waited 17 excruciatingly long years for this. And I'm not going to mess it up. In these last five months I've twirled more than a dozen signs. I've directed people to the mattress sale. The subdivision with new homes to buy. And to the charity car wash. I'm so proud of myself, I'm just absolutely busting. I can't wait to see what else the future holds. All signs are pointing to an incredible journey."
