        "Summarize the following story in first person: Our son just recently turned 7 years old and we wanted to surprise him. My wife thought that maybe taking him to LA and going to Disneyland would be the best thing to do. We even thought about maybe going to the Grand Canyon because hr really enjoys it and likes getting out in nature, which is great for a kid. He loves science and going to National Parks. We were almost going to make this happen but we changed our minds. My father was saying that he kept mentioning this waterpark near where he lives in Washington. This is near Seattle. He said that it would be a great place to take him because he loves water parks but had never actually been to one. Also, some of my sons friends live there and they would love to celebrate with him. We thought about it long and hard and decided to do it. It was also financially easier for us as well. So, we planned a huge surprise thing and even booked a specific area within the park to have a bbq and party for him. We brought him there telling him that he was going to see his grandfather, but instead we went to he waterpark. He was very excited and happy. All of his friends were there and he could not believe it. He loved it and had a smile on his face the whole entire time. We are glad we chose to go here and had a great time doing this for him."
