        "Summarize the following story in first person: Today was pretty great. We went to my husband's aunt's birthday. There was everything you want there, cake conversation and woohoowilly a playground. Im so surprised but delighted my kids wouldnt have to sit bored inside the whole time. Every restaraunt should have one. The kids had a good time so that meant I did too. There were about 30 of us at the spot, all talking and laughing and eating(when the food finally made its wayward way to each of us). My salad was a huge mountain and I gleefully dug in. I was thrilled to be out of the house and socializing. After we ate I took the kids outside for some fun. The playground was packed but they had a blast. A man sat outside singing for the guests who visited the restaraunt. He strummed his guitar and the mood was light and summery. Even more luck since there was a pokistop right on the playground. When they had worn themselves out, we went back inside for more food and fun. Truely a fantastic night."
