        "Summarize the following story in first person: The day started out fine. Having breakfast and relaxing at McDonald's when this guy sits at the very next table. Already I'm like, ugh. An empty restaurant and he sits next to me. First red flag. I try to ignore him and concentrate on my emails. He turns around in his seat and I'm like, oh, no. He starts with the small talk and I'm being frigid to let him know I'm don't care. He turns away. Turns back. Eventually, I straight said to leave me alone. Turns forward and back five times, whining I wasn't paying him the attention he apparently thought I owed him. I lose it. I go off on him. Employees creep up to see what's going on but they stay back because this is not the first time someone's bothered me and I took care it. He starts ranting that I need mental help as he packs up to leave. Then he drops the C bomb. And it's not the one you think it is. He calls me a crazy chink, which I haven't heard since high school. And then the classic go back to where you come from. I come from Florida, dummy, but nice try. He ruined my breakfast. Twenty-something years without someone yelling racist crap at me and now this classic material. It ruined my day, honestly. I was in a mood until I went to bed, just thinking about what happened, feeling sick and disappointed in people."
