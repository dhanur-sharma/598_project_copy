        "Summarize the following story in first person: I bought a new car a few months ago. I really didn't want to, my wife was the one who had talked me into doing it, as she had been bugging me about getting a new car for awhile. We also went the day after we had gotten into a pretty big fight, so I guess I just wanted to make her happy. She promised we would make some lifestyle changes to be able to afford this car. Mainly to stop eating out as much and she was supposed to get some kind of a job. Even to just work on Mturk to make a little extra money to help put towards it. I have been hustling and doing a lot of side jobs to help bring in extra cash, but she has done nothing. It's very frustrating as I already work a full time job and am doing side jobs to help afford this car and other bills, and she is doing nothing. Since completing this original hit she has still not lifted a finger to help. I shouldn't be surprised as this is not the first time she has promised to help out to make me happy in the moment, and wound up doing absoutely nothing to help. We have gotten into fights over this many times before. At this point I am just done. I don't want her to get a job just to shut me up. I want her to do it because she actually wants to contribute something. She knows how stressed I am about bills and money, and it really hurts that she doesn't care."
