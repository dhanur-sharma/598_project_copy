        "Summarize the following story in first person: Since my husbands suicide following his return from deployment in 2012,  I have struggled with the grief of losing my family, life, any friends we had, even friends that I had.  It has been very difficult dealing with the images of finding him, trying to save him.  The memories of blame from his family and some of the people in his unit have destroyed me mentally and fueled the guilt and self-hatred that come along with my PTSD from this event to this very day. Even as a parent who loves her child, I found myself fighting the weight of crippling depression unsuccessfully.  As a result, I began seeking therapy and counseling so that my daughter can have the kind of mother every child deserves to have, bringing me to the present. I have been in counseling on and off for 7 years and have learned a lot, including that I was severely abused my entire life without understanding it and that I had grown up in a cult, which, unbeknownst to me, had already created a significant amount of trauma with which I lived. I struggle every day.  But my struggles are more manageable.  Over the past six months, I learned how to use grounding and mindfulness as a tool to bring myself out of a trauma reaction to the present moment.  And I found a great help for some of the symptoms of PTSD from a very surprising source-legal, medical marijuana. I have had a great deal of progress over the past 3 months, since I began using medical marijuana.  I am able to sleep.  I have been able to maintain a healthy weight, because I have an appetite again.  And it helps me to slow down, and be mindful regarding sensory stimuli while helping me to ground myself more quickly before I react. But most importantly, the absolute rages I experienced are not only decreased in frequency and magnitude, but eliminated altogether.  This was a major concern of mine, because I did not want my child growing up in a home living with my symptoms.  I never wanted my over reaction to stress to create anxiety in my child and I never wanted my child to have to cope with \"Mommy's symptoms\", because Mommy could or did not.  Going to parenting classes and reading parenting books has helped set a foundation for me as a parent.  I have used and exhausted every mental health resource available to me that I am aware of.  And I am far from normal or where my peers are, but I am functional, for which I am extremely grateful."
