        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was a rainy afternoon about a month ago and I was running an errand at the grocery store for my mother. I was a little grumbly about it as I was really busy that day and didn't really have time for this. I already had a few other errands to run so I was already behind on what needed to be done that day. Thankfully, I didn't need to get much at the store, just some perishables. I had just finished checking out and pushed the small shopping card to my car, umbrella in hand. As I begun loading the car with the groceries, a small black car rolled up next to me and rolled down it's window. Thinking they were going to comment on my political bumper stickers I thought \"Oh boy, here we go!\". Wasn't exactly in the mood for a political conversation and just wanted to get out of there. Well, the guy in the car said \"Hey, are you (my name, first and last) by any chance?\" Skeptical, I said \"Yes, I am. Do I know you?\" The voice sounded familiar, though distantly and I couldn't place it. He told me his name and that we went to high school together. His name sounded really familiar, dang it...couldn't place it but I did feel I knew him at some point. After chatting with him in the rain for a moment it hit me all at once who this was. This was one of the handful of people who was nice to me in high school! Oh my God! This was a rare someone I actually hung out with in high school! Given I was bullied without mercy and was a hardcore recluse (still am something of a recluse to this day), that was a big feat! My mouth dropped open and I said \"1-800-555-ElCheapo!!!\" El Cheapo was this sarcastic series of letters we wrote from dark or incompetent characters such as King Koopa or Bozo the Clown that came up with ideas and rules for the school that we didn't like or felt were unfair to the teachers/school board encouraging them to enact these rules. It was sort of a parody and lampoon of the school as a whole. Great way to vent and relieve stress given we were both sort of on the social fringe of the school. He said \"Yeah man, that's it!\", recalling it! After graduation we had lost touch and this was the first I'd seen of him in 20 years. We chatted for quite a while in the rain, catching up on life. We exchanged contact information before moving on with our day. So that day went from bad, frustrating, and annoying to a huge smile on my face."
