        "Summarize the following story in first person: My estranged husband decided he didn't want to be married anymore, 23 years of marriage, down the drain.  He had totally ignored his other, older children from the time we got married.  He only concentrated on the children we had together.  We even had a son of his, from another marriage, living with us too.  He had full custody of him because his mother was a drunk and didn't want him.  It wasn't the best of situations, but we made it work.  I think, after awhile, the guilt from totally ignoring his other children, got to him.   He finally got in touch with them and started to build a relationship with them.  He began spending more and more time with his other family, and he no longer seemed to care about our family we had together.  He kept staying out where his other family lived (about an hour away) more and more.  Pretty soon he was out there more than he was here.  Finally one day he told me, he didn't want to be married anymore.  I was devastated, but there wasn't much I could do about it.  So he began moving his stuff out little by little until he was completely moved out.  I was totally crushed for about 1 year, but after awhile, I realized I liked living without him.  As a matter of fact, I liked it so much, that I realized he did me a favor.  I started to realize, our marriage wasn't that great after all, and we shouldn't be together.  I can tell you, that today, I couldn't be happier.  I love living alone.  And, as a side note, I absolutely can't stand that man I used to married to."
