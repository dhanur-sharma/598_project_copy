        "Summarize the following story in first person: This past August our son and his family came for a visit. It was our daughter-in-law's birthday the day they arrived so I planned a surprise family birthday party. I planned the menu: grilled meats, twice-baked potatoes, a green salad. I also purchased a birthday cake  from the best bakery in town. I bought decorations online: colorful streamers and globes to hang, a happy birthday banner, and some matching cake plates and napkins. While she went for a walk with her family, my husband and I put up the decorations. The decorations turned out to be exceptional. They were colorful and reflected light from the sun...very joyful and festive. I thought this would mostly be fun for our grand-daughters to experience. The girls did love it, reacting with surprise and excitement. However, my daughter-in-law was equally surprised and delighted. She said she couldn't remember when she last had a \"traditional\" birthday party. She even got teary-eyed. Our meal was excellent. My husband grilled steaks and sausage while I baked some salmon. Potatoes and salad were made the day before, so prep was easy. We sat down to a gourmet candlelight dinner, including a favorite wine and lots of table conversation. The girls were getting giddy after dinner so they were put to bed a bit early. Then the adults enjoyed her birthday cake, complete with candles. All in all, it turned out to be a very positive, memorable experience which continued to grow an already good relationship with our daughter-in-law."
