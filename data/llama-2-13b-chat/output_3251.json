        "Summarize the following story in first person: I finally graduated four months ago. I've had some time to think about it, and I want to jot down some feelings. Even after four months, I can't tell you how excited I am to be finished with school. What a great and freeing feeling. I can still remember seeing my parents, my family, and my friends standing up when they called my name. I was SO happy to see them. There were people that I had just seen the night before, and then people that I hadn't seen in years. They were there for me! How cool is that? And then to hear the cheers as I was walking up to the podium to grab my diploma. That was such a thrilling experience. I am so proud of myself for completing such an important milestone in my life. It wasn't easy, and I never want to go through that again, but I am so glad I did it. I now have the rest of my life ahead of me. I know that I will do great things. I welcome my new life!"
