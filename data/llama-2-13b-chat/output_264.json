        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was in September when i  found our my brother was getting married. He sent me a little invitation which i accepted and sent back. The wedding was taking place in November. Fast forward two months and i am getting ready for this wedding. I was really anxious at first because there were a lot of family members that i have not seen in a long time. My cousins that haven't seen in over 10 years would be there as well. So would some of my aunts and uncles as well. I tried to see it as exciting rather than being nervous. I ended up with an all black suit and a nice flowery tie. I didn't want to look too dark so the tie really made the suit pop. I traveled to Chicago for this wedding and it happened on a Saturday night. Everything went really well. I got to catch up with some cousins and we even exchanged numbers. It happens that we all have the same hobby which is gaming! I saw some of my old aunts and uncles as well and noticed everyone was doing well."

We all had a great time. The wedding was a great experience and i was able to reconnect with some of my family members.\n\n"
