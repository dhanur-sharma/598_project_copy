        "Summarize the following story in first person: My husband's 60th birday was approaching, so I decided to do something extra special for him this year.  Since he enjoys staying at hotels, I booked a room at a luxury hotel for a weekend getaway. I did not tell him before we checked-in to the hotel, but I had chosen this hotel because it had a large, heated indoor pool. We got to our room and I immediately opened my suitcase and pulled out his swimming trunks, that I had packed in secret.  We changed into our swim clothes and headed down to the pool. As we approached the pool, we both noticed that there was also a whirlpool located next to the pool. I was elated! My husband suffers from back pain and the whirlpool would certainly made him feel good. We swam for quite a while, then relaxed in the whirlpool. After we got back to our room, we both were extremely hungry and we agreed that a steak dinner was what we wanted. We ate our favorite steaks along with baked potatoes and creamed spinach.  For dessert, my both had the most delicious chocolate cake that we'd ever eaten. After dinner, I gave him directions to a nearby movie theater, where we planned to see a remake of one of his favorite movies, The Lion King. The theater featured state of the art video and sound, but when we entered the theater to take our seats, I was astonished to see that all of the seats were overstuffed leather recliners that changed position with the touch of a button. Again, this made me particularly happy because of my husband's back issues, sitting for long periods of time can be painful for him. I was sure that he would be very comfortable in his seat and would be able to enjoy the movie thoroughly, which he was and he did.  The sound and video quality, along with the comfort of the seats made us decide that we would never go to different theater ever again. All in all, the weekend was a great success because my husband had a fantastic time."
