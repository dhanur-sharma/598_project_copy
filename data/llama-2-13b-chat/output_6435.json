        "Summarize the following story in first person: My cousin is in the Navy. He doesn't get off from duty very often, but he did about 4 months ago or so. He came down to visit us for a few days, maybe a weekend or so. He likes to visit my family the most, as we don't have a great relationship with my grandmother or other extended family. Anyways, we always used to go to a graveyard near our house. This time we decided to go to a nearby Publix or Kroger and buy a bottle of wine each, and we did just that. So around midnight or 1 am, we drank a bottle of wine each and started on the way to the graveyard that was about a half mile or so from the house. We took a shortcut through a wooded section and we heard a coyote howl pretty close to us. I think it might have made both of us jump, so we hurried out into the streetlit area. As we neared the graveyard, there was no one else out, no cars on the road at all. Inside the graveyard we sat and talked for awhile. After a while I noticed that there was something that kept flying over us. Every now and then I would see bats flying around the graveyard, which was honestly a very cool thing to see. We both really enjoyed our adventure to the graveyard. Seeing bats in a graveyard and hearing a coyote that close, while both drunk on wine makes for a night I won't forget easily!"
