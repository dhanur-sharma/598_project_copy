        "Summarize the following story in first person: Probably the most memorable event to happen to me recently has been finding out that I have a baby coming. I remember the day more vividly than anything else I can think of. We woke up early and she wasn't feeling well. She hadn't been feeling well for a while and we were concerned, though we knew that pregnancy was a possibility. By noon, she still felt like she had to throw up constantly, so we made the decision to get a pregnancy test. Since she didn't feel good, I went up to the Dollar Tree alone to get two pregnancy tests. It was a beautiful day outside so I took my time and enjoyed myself on the way there. I was nervous buying the pregnancy kits. I'm not sure why, because I'm an adult in my mid 30s, but it still made me feel like I was doing something I shouldn't be doing. I headed straight home with the pregnancy tests, where my wife was ready and waiting to take one. She took one of the boxes from me and ran into the bathroom. About a minute later, she emerged with a smile on her face and held up the test to show me the positive result. We both smiled and hugged eachother. We held eachother for a minute and then kissed. Even though we knew it was possible she was pregnant, this made it real."
