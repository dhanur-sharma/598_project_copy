There was one quiz where it was not really relevant to my job and i could not figure it out. You only had three times to pass (and the questions changed) before you had to request a reset. I used my three attempt and could not figure out how to request a reset. My store does not really have new employees so my boss had no idea how to reset it either. I had to call and basically do my own research before figuring it out. That took a couple days.  Eventually with the pressure on I came in for a saturday to just finish this once and for all. I thought I would be there for 2 hours. I ended up being there for 6 hours. I passed though. Now I am fully involved in work and dont feel like my job is threatened. I can just relax. It is a great feeling. In the end I would say it was worth it."
