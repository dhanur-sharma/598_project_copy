        "Summarize the following story in first person: For the first time, I had to attend the funeral of a friend I held very dear.  She was a wonderful woman with children my age and grandchildren my daughter's age. She was diagnosed with cancer about a year ago, but did not seem worried.  I was there while she was going through her chemo treatments and everything seemed fine until last month when she decided to stop chemo and go on to hospice care.  She told me of her decision and while I was devastated, I understood and prayed for comfort. The last time I saw her, she seemed so much better and full of life, but died only two days later.  Her funeral was filled with people who loved her very much. I didn't realize she had so many friends until that day.  I brought my toddler to the visitation and her husband was very happy to have a child as a distraction. Everyone there was celebrating Her life, although we were also there to mourn the loss of such an amazing woman.  One thing I noticed was that her body was nowhere to be seen; she had told me she wanted to be buried in our church cemetery, so I thought that was still the plan.  While speaking to her husband, he mentioned that during the last day, Pam, who had prepared and paid for everything up front had a sudden change of heart and completely changed her plans. While he had just lost his wife, he was still able to laugh at the changes because it was a behavior very typical of Her.  She liked to make long and detailed plans only to change them at the very last minute and fly by the seat of her pants. I really do miss her and think about her often. I will carry her with me always."
