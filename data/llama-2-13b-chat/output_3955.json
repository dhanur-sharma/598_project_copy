        "Summarize the following story in first person: My wife and I had a messy separation and divorce. I had tried to avoid it, but fights and arguments would still take place. I even had to live like a homeless person for a few weeks at a time due to our struggles. Finally, we pulled the cord on our marriage by getting divorced. Following the divorce, I went through a dark period. Thankfully, during this dark period. I met a great woman. She is aware of my previous marriage. She encourages me to move forward. She forgives me for my past. I'm still with her today. I am thankful that someone else decided to be with me although I had a divorce. This serves as a strong reminder to me. Tough times pass with persistence and hard work. If you give up, the tough times will never pass."
