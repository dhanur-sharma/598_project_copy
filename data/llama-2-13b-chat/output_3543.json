        "Summarize the following story in first person: Recently, my daughter became pregnant with her third child. We were also very excited about it! Things were progressing nicely, and normally for the first seven months of her pregnancy. Two months ago she went in for a routine doctor visit, and the doctor couldn't find the heartbeat of the baby. A few hours later she was in the hospital being induced to have the child. I was with her through the entire experience, holding her hand and trying to comfort her as best I could. As awful as it was, I was able to be with her through this very difficult time. It took about three hours before she was ready to have the stillborn child. Five hours after she was started, she was holding her little tiny girl in her arms. She spent a few days recovering from it, and then we had a funeral for the tiny baby. My husband and I were heartbroken. Years ago we lost a child, so we knew kind of what they were going through. As hard as it has been, during the last few months they have been strong, and have continued with their lives. It is ironic because through this time we have seen how it has strengthened their family. As hard as it was, they will come out better for it."
