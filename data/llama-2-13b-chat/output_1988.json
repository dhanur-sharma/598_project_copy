        "Summarize the following story in first person: Six months ago, I found out that I was pregnant! I'm married, and have been for three years. Before I got pregnant, we like to hang out with friends, drink, and smoke weed. Neither one of us had a great childhood. Both of us had alcoholic stepdads and mom's that let them mistreat us. When I found out that I was pregnant, we both new that we wanted a better family life for our child than what we had. We stopped drinking and smoking weed, and focused on spending quality time together and time with family and friends doing non-party things. My husband got a great job as an electrician. We had started to get the nursery ready, but we didn't know yet if the baby was a boy or a girl. We got some gender neutral things, and decided to wait to buy more until after the ultrasound. Well, I guess that we could have went ahead and bought either because we found out at the ultrasound that we are having twins, a boy and a girl. We are both so excited for this opportunity! We are both only children, so this is something neither one of us have experience with. We are looking forward to the challenge! We are both happy that our lives have changed in such an amazing way!"
