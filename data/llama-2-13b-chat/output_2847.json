        "Summarize the following story in first person: Starting August 25th, I decided to embark on a spiritual cleanse. During this time I was to abstain from social media, television, lustful thoughts, cursing, swearing, and sweets for 1 month. The purpose of this cleanse was to test my willpower. In addition to this, I made it my priority to test my spiritual faith during this time, The cleanse proved to be difficult at first but became progressively easier. During the first week, I struggled to tame my mind in the presence of temptation. I did experience a significant relapse. It was discouraging. After the first 2 weeks, I felt more clear minded. After 3 weeks, I felt stronger both spiritually, physically, and mentally. I was able to keep my composure in stressful situations with less effort. At this point, I started to feel a sense of accomplishment. After the 1 month period, I began to question how was I suppose to transition back to regular life. The cleanse ultimately did the job. I felt proud of myself for successfully enduring this personal test. I tested my willpower and found out that cutting out certain things in my life deepened my spirituality and improved my overall state of wellness."
