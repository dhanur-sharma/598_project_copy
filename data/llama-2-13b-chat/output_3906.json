        "Summarize the following story in first person: A few months ago my husband and I along with our friends Jon and Lisa took a trip to Colorado for a nice four-day weekend. While we were there we took one full day out of our schedule to tour the garden of the gods near Colorado Springs on segways. We had a blast! The park was incredibly beautiful. And I really enjoyed riding around on the segways. They actually go really fast! It was a little scary at first riding  them but you got used to it very quickly. I would absolutely do it again. We also got to go skiing and did a little bit of rock climbing too! I really enjoy colorado. There is so much to do there compared to back home! The mountains are just beautiful and the people are so friendly! I really would like to return soon. I think everyone else on the trip would agree with me that we need to do this again. They all didn't want to leave!"
