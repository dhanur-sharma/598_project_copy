        "Summarize the following story in first person: This summer me and some friends went to the beach for a three day weekend. It was supposed to be a really good time, we arrived on a Thursday afternoon. The water was lush and the temperature was perfect. We all went to the beach the next Friday. It was a really good time, everyone was having a lot of fun. The next Saturday we woke up and went to brunch before hitting the beach again. Once again, it was a memorable time and we all had a lot of fun. We went body surfing in the water when all of a sudden we saw a shark fin. Another swimmer appeared to have gotten bit, this was completely crazy. I swam as fast as I could to help the other swimmer, and when I arrived he seemed ok. But he couldn\u2019t swim, and so I helped him to get back to the shore. It was a struggle to help him. When I got back to the shore I looked around for the lifeguard but couldn\u2019t find him. So I wrapped up the shark bite wounds with my towel and drove this guy to the hospital. The hospital said he would be ok and only needed some stitches. I waited for the guy to get the medical treatment that he needed. It didn\u2019t take that long and he eventually got the treatment. Later that day he thanked me and invited me and my friends to a party. We all became good friends and to this very day, we all stay in touch. It was a radical moment in my life."
