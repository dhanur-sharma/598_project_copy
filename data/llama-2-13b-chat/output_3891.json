        "Summarize the following story in first person: It has always been a dream of mine to take a trip to the might Buffalo National River and go on a float trip. I'd been to Saco a few times with some friends and I have always been yearning for another trip. We\u2019re all getting older, so it\u2019s tougher to organize a trip with everyone, but I was committed to going. It was the last thing I wanted to do on my bucket list and I was presented with the perfect time to go about 3 months ago when I had quit my job after being offered a much better paying job in a new city. I took the leap and took the trip to the river on my own in this free time I had. I was nervous since I would be alone, but even if I didn\u2019t make friends, I would be content floating on the river and relaxing in nature for 6 days. Much to my luck, when I got there, I almost instantly found a few people who were in the same situation I was and we bonded instantly. As we floated down the river, swapping stories and kicking back beers, our group grew larger and larger. It got to the point where we were floating in a big group of about a dozen people. We were from all walks of life and we would have never met or interacted in any other setting. Everyone had a unique life experience and we all enjoyed each other\u2019s company and stories. We would stay up all night talking about our lives, what led us here, what we hope the future brings, and shared some of our fondest memories from growing up. This group of people were amazing, and I am so happy I was able to meet them. The weather on the trip was perfect so I was able to relax with my new friends without having to worry about the conditions too much. As it turns out, a few of the people I met were from the city I was moving to, so I made sure to get their contact info. I even met a really cute girl who I made plans with meeting up with once I got to the city and settled in. This trip truly was life changing."
