        "Summarize the following story in first person: We went gem mining last weekend. It was such a fun experience! We definitely paid for it, but overall, it was pretty cheap. Less than ten dollars a head. The only bummer is that it was a panning experience, not a true mining experience. We didn't do any digging. We just played in the mud and slurry (that's water filled with mud and rock particles, specific to mining and sundry.)I wound up pegging myself as the \"rock lady.\" Everyone was asking my opinion about rocks! Not to toot my own horn, but I correctly identified seven types of precious and semi-precious stones. I would up bringing home three emeralds, a sapphire, and a ruby. One of the kids found a massive geode. Each of the kids found at least three precious stones. It was so exciting! They were all just as thrilled as I was. I swear, I came off as more excited than they did. But then, I really well and truly love rocks. The biggest surprise about the whole experience was how many gems we found. I always worry that the kind of \"tourist-y\" attractions are scams, but sure enough, we struck gold! (Figuratively speaking.) I haven't had that much fun in years. I loved every minute of it, and have extracted promises to do the experience again in the future. My mom actually asked to come next time."
