        "Summarize the following story in first person: Six months ago I had my birthday! I always love preparing in advance and treating the guests with cake pieces, sweets, snacks, soft drinks and tea. The most memorable portion of this was being with my family which is rare. My dad is in jail and my mom and I are not too close. Despite this, i love spending time with her. I really wish my dad was here as well but I have accepted that he is gone. I try to be as positive as possible though and look at the bright side. It can always be worse. I will always hold these memories dear as nothing lasts forever. Every year gets better and better though and makes me feel like my mom and I are close. It's comforting. My writing experience was good. It came naturally because it's based on true facts of my life in a way. It is based on your prompt but I twisted it into my life. My dad is in jail but my mom and I are actually very close. We have to be to get through something like that. I am interested in writing more if needed."
