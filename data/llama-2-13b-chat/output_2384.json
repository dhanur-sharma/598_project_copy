        "Summarize the following story in first person: In May of this year I was able to go to Holland and visit with my family. It was particularly memorable because it was my parents 50th wedding anniversary. Because of different circumstances in my personal life, it had been 4 years since I had seen my family in person. The last time I saw my nephew he was just 9 months old, now he was almost five. My other nephew was just a boy last time I saw him, now he's a senior in high school. It made me realize how time flies and how much I have missed not being near my family for the past 4 years. For my parents anniversary I had found some old pictures of both my mom and dad when they were younger, and a few from when they just started dating. I restored these pictures in Photoshop, printed them out and made a picture collage that I gave them as a gift. It made my mom emotional seeing these pictures of how young they were, and I think she was sad because life is so short. One of the pictures in particular was difficult for her, because it was one of my mom and my aunt when they were just teenagers, and my aunt has recently passed away.  My mom was so happy though with this gift, and anytime someone came over she proudly showed it to them. It made me happy I put in the effort of giving a personalized gift. For their actual anniversary, the whole family got together and we went for a hike in a nearby forest. After the hike we had dinner at a pancake house and finished at my parents' house for dessert. I will treasure this memory forever."
