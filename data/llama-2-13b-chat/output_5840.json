        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was called as a witness in a parental rights case in May. I was subpoena by both the state and the mother which I believe was unusual. The mother was expecting to be able to influence how I would testify but I explained to the judge's clerk that she was trying to influence me.  The judge held a hearing to verify that I intended to honestly testify about the case. During the hearing the judge admonished the defense and sent the case to arbitration prior to hearing the full case.  During the arbitration period the defense and the state negotiated a custody agreement that did not remove the mother's rights permanently. The surprise was that the mother agreed to give rights to my friend who is the great-grandmother and list me as the backup if my friend is unable to care for the child due to a health condition which flares up regularly.  I was totally amazed to receive custody of a 4 year old boy who is not related to me. It has been difficult at times because the child has behavioral issues due to abuse and the drug environment which his mother was raising him in. The rewards of watching him heal and starting to grow into a normal child is very rewarding and provides a fulfillment in my life. I retired earlier this year and had planned to spend it doing many activities which did not include being involved in raising a child again. I have become involved in arranging therapy, doctor's appointments, preschool, etc. This is not how I planned for my retirement be but I have decided that this will be just as rewarding as raising my children was. I have adapted my plans and others have stepped up to help me so that I can still do some of the travel that I had planned to see my own family.  The zoo has replaced Europe as a destination!"
