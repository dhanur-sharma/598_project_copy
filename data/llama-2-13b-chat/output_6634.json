        "Summarize the following story in first person: I recently got vacation time to relax after a rather stressful period at work. I knew that I wanted to got somewhere with a lot of sun shine and beach views. so, naturally, my top two options were Florida or Hawaii. I found a good deal on a Hawaiian package after searching for vacation packages online. I was looking at a 5 days, 4 night on the sunny beached of Hawaiian. I was excited and eager to start my relaxation. Little did I know that this vacation did the exact opposite for me. When I arrived at the hotel, I was amazed at the tropical scene, the cool, blue skies, and the active beaches. After getting situation in my hotel room, I ate some breakfast. It was then that I first noticed it in the hotel's restaurant. There doesn't seem to be a lot singles here. All I see are couples or hotel workers. I look around the restaurant, and It seems like I am the only single guy here. I got self-conscious real quick after that. I tried to forget about this by eating my breakfast and to head to the beach. Once at the beach, the scene got worse for me. I laid on a beach chair and saw couple after couple smiling and enjoying themselves. Seeing them just made me realize how alone I am. My desire to form a connection with another person was raging within me. I couldn't enjoy the rest of my vacation after that. As I boarded my flight home, I made a promise to myself that when I return here, it would be with a girlfriend and me proposing to her on that beach."
