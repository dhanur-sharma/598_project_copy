        "Summarize the following story in first person: Journal entry, it's been months of clean scans and health since the cancer scare. I've been living life with more purpose recently, going out more, being more healthy in habit. Not everything magically changes with post cancer life, it's not a movie where I suddenly become my fullest. I've recently looked into going back to school and changing my career. Besides trying to change my career and habits, I've been reconnecting to older friends as well. It's challenging to try and improve so much at once. Some steps are backwards, but I've kept them in strides and bounce back. Life in some ways is mundane right now, while that can be it's own blessing. With so much anxiety in the past I'm glad to be optimistic towards the future. Some nights I wake up with night terrors remembering the surgery and cancer, grabbing my scar in reaction. Thankfully these are slowing down with each month. With a reminder of that past I keep moving towards a healthy lifestyle. I hope that others will find that same optimism I had to find. I look forward to seeing what is around my corner. With all this said, that's my recent story."
