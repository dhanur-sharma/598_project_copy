        "Summarize the following story in first person: A few months ago, I experienced what I know as the most fearful experience of my life. It was late in the evening and my body began to shake. Cold chills ran throughout my body and I lost control of my ability to breath. My chest began pounding and I gasped for air. I called out to my partner, and suddenly he was there in front of me. I could not see him though, because my sight had been taken from me and my head began sweating. My partner grabbed me by the shoulders and began shaking me, and when that didn't work he lightly slapped my face. The chills made a change to heat and I broke out in a heated sweat. This was my first panic attack. It lasted no more than 15 minutes, but it felt like hours. My body was so weak after the fact and I could have sworn in that moment that I was going to die. My life seemed to flash before my eyes and all I could see was him. My partner, the love of my life, having to live a life without me in it. That is the day I realized that I had to go to therapy again. I made an appointment the very next day to seek help."
