        "Summarize the following story in first person: Today I had to bring my car to the mechanic.  I was involved in an accident and it was a single car.  I was so happy when they told me they would fix the car for free. I was surprised that today somebody would be willing to do that. I was going to tell everyone I knew about what a great company they were.  There are not many people in the world today who would be willing to do anything for free. It truly shows that there are still some amazing people out there. I love that they went above and beyond. My car now looks as good as new. I am very happy with everything. I am glad I had brought my car to them because someone else may not have done that. If I know anyone that is looking to get their car repaired I will refer them to this place. I was sad when the accident happened. I am just glad they were able to take care of everything for me. The work was done in a quick manner. All being said I met a great company that I would continue to use in the future. I will now pay it forward and help someone when they need something. This has restore my faith in humanity. Great people like them still exist in this world and I still have my car which I really love."
