        "Summarize the following story in first person: This story is about an altercation i had with some thugs around my neighborhood. It all started when my little brother and sister were on their way home from school. While coming home they ran into these thugs from another school. It was around 10 of them and just my little brother and sister. So these thugs were getting ready to bank them however I could hear this all happening and ran out side and chased them all away. We called the police nothing was done. A few weeks past and 3 of them came back and broke my window. I tracked them down with another brother and said why u break my window. Next thing you know its about 15 of them now wanting to fight us because we are white. We knew we couldn't fight some minors so we ran home but they chased us. We were banked by all of them. All they wanted to do is cause terror and fight. We called the cops because my brother did get punched by one in the face and of course they broke the window. The cops took for ever to get here and when they did the thugs ran away. However the cops had the audacity to say it was our own problem. And the one who broke the window was right in front of the cop calling him a profanity and the cop did not even arrest him. This was very surprising the police officer knowing this was the thug who committed the crime did nothing and let him run away. The only thing that stopped these thugs from coming back and harassing us was going to their school and it all stopped."
