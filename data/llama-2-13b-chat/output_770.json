        "Summarize the following story in first person: I've always wanted a VR headset. It's one of those things I've wanted since I was a child. When the technology came out I was super excited to try it out but I didn't have the funds at the time. and it was very expensive. Not too long ago the prices have gone down and it's more affordable, so I've been able to purchase one. I was very excited to show it off to my friends and family. I held a party and let people try it out. Since then multiple people have talked to me about it asking questions. Such as how can they get one, what kind of PC do they need, etc. It's been a blast to be honest. Showing it off to my parents and other family and friends has been incredible. We tried many different types of games. From racing games to horror games, arcade games. We found different types of VR experiences for all the family members. Everyone found something they could get into. It was so amazing seeing non gamers put on the headset and immediately become immersed in the technology. It was truly a wonderful experience."
