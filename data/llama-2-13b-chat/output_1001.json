        "Summarize the following story in first person: This is a story about how I got my dog. I recently went through an unexpected divorce.  I thought I was in a happy marriage until my husband ran off with a younger woman, totally unexpected. I spent the next few months alone but was very unhappy and lonely so I decided to get a companion dog. I didn't want a puppy as I was not interested in training him/her. I started looking into a rescue greyhound from a local rescue. The rescue seem to take the process very seriously and I liked what they stood for. I paid a visit to them with my girlfriend and since it was 50 miles away I was expecting to see a few dogs to choose from. They had two. The first had a lot of medical issues that was a bit much for me  to handle so I did not meet her. The second was a couple of years older than I was anticipating but thought it would be nice to meet her. She was black with while socks and white tip on her tail, very pretty dog. I walked her around the yard and she was so sweet. She did everything I wanted to and seem to have the saddest eyes when she looked up at me. She is 7 years old and seemed to be healthy. She was born in Australia and was raced in China for many years. They closed the race track there and she was kept as one of 600 dogs with no where to go. The rescue group close to me heard of these dogs and was able to get 20 of them out of China. Of the 600 dogs, only 300 were made healthy enough to be rescued out of the country. I couldn't resist, I brought her home. That was 5 months ago. Since then she has become my constant companion. No matter what room I am in, she finds a spot to sit and watch me. Her physical went well and has no known medical issues. Love my dear dog."
