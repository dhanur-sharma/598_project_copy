My 1-year-old little girl had recently gone down for a snooze when, during the time spent pressing, I understood that my child's earphones, the ones he used to watch a motion picture on the plane, had broken. I called over the house to my mom that I was going to race to the store to supplant them. \"Me as well,\" my child said.
