        "Summarize the following story in first person: Dear Diary:As you know, I'm the captain of my Ice Hockey team at Michigan State. About six months ago, a fight started while we were playing. The play was fast and furious and very quickly a fight started. I had to remove Kate from the game because she was the one who started the fight with a player from Ohio State. The referee also confirmed that Kate started it. Later, I had also talked to Ohio State's captain (Brenda) about the fight after she had talked to her player (Ann) who was the victim of the fight. I couldn't believe it but Kate actually was pissed about it when I confronted her after the game and claimed I didn't believe her. This isn't like Kate, but I know she just broke up with her boyfriend and has been argumentative with most of us so I've basically written it off as a one-shot problem with her. In the last six months, she's finally been her normal self with everyone including me. Anyway, a couple of my teammates and I were at a party and a video of that particular game was being played and I watched that fight again. I'm very frustrated at myself. I had them run the video several times at a very slow rate and I finally saw what Kate had originally told me. It was Ann who started the fight very subtly and unnoticeable but definitely showed running the video slowly. The referee, Ohio State's captain and I were all wrong and Ann, the player had lied. I feel like a poor captain but mostly, my not trusting Kate has really gotten me down. I took her aside and apologized over and over about it. She's forgiven me but hoped that I would never distrust her again."
