        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was shocked to discover that the daughter of a friend of mine had died. I knew her best when we were teenagers. We used to travel a lot to Chicago from Memphis is another friend's old Chevy II. During those times we would kid around and even sing songs. But I was careful not to be too forward with her since her mother was in the car with us. I was about nineteen at the time I first met her and I believe she was around 15. Her mother is now in her late 80s and Carolyn died in her mid-sixties. I felt so bad first that she died and secondly, that I had not tried to keep up with her over the years. I last saw her at a funeral of a mutual friend. She was still beautiful but she was with her second husband. I met her first husband at our book club meetings and I was surprised she would have chosen a man like him. He was fairly grumpy and not too smart. I had to compare myself with him and it made me think I would have had a shot with her had I tried to date her as an adult. I too, though, had two children with a spouse that I wasn't particularly suited for. It's a shame she died. She was beautiful, funny and kind."
