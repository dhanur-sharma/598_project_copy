        "Summarize the following story in first person: I recently went on vacation with my husband to Walt Disney World in Florida. One of the most memorable things that happened on that trip was when my husband took me to the new Star Wars land in Hollywood Studios. I have been a huge Star Wars fan for over 20 years, so going to this land was really exciting for me. When we were in the land, my husband and I were going around the land and I was completely entranced with all of the details of the land. Now my husband is not that huge of a Star Wars fan. He hasn't even seen all of the movies, but he went through the whole thing with me and supported me as I nerd-ed out. As we walked through, he started asking me more and more about what he was seeing. I was able to explain a lot of inside things that a normal fan may not have known about. He really took an interest. Eventually we made our way to the made gift shop, the Den of Antiquities. This is hands own one of the coolest gift shops I have ever seen. The gift shop is divided into two main areas: one for the Light Side and one of the Dark. In the middle of the shop are the legacy lightsabers and a bunch of artifacts from other characters that did not fall into either side. We went back to that gift shop quite a few times in our time there, trying to decide what souvenirs to bring home. On one of our last trips into the shop, my husband asked me to step outside. Knowing he was up to something, I did as he asked with no argument. When he came outside to join me he had a small black, velvet bag with him. When I opened it I found a necklace. But not just any necklace, the exact replica from the one Rose wore in Episode 8. It was so amazing! Not only did my husband think enough to buy me a necklace, but he made sure to get one that he knew would mean the world to me. It was so surprising and really made me feel like I had someone that was always going to be there for me."
