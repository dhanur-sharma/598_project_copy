        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was a Sunday I can still remember it was raining outside. I had nothing to do really except for laundry but there's always laundry. I have a 14 month old and she's very messy. I came back from the laundry room to check my phone, I'm always on there it's my only source of entertainment. I saw that I had a missed call from Dan, I thought huh what did John do now. I checked my voicemail and this time it wasn't what did John do, it was what had happened to him. I found out John was in the ICU and on life support and that Dan asked me if I wanted to come with him to the hospital because the doctors had requested he come, he was the emergency contact.  I had my sister come watch my daughter while I went with Dan to the hospital. John was there, intubated and sedated and they said that he isn't going to die but they had to intubate him because they had to sedate him, he was combative with them when they were trying to help him he was also put in restraints so he couldn't fight anymore or try to hurt the nurses and doctors. I had told the doctor what I know about John and his problem with drugs and mental health I told them it was probably a suicide attempt, even had a notebook with a suicide note written for me, actually had that for a while no date on it. After his stay in the ICU he was taken to the psychiatric unit where he stayed a month and got treated for his major depression and also PTSD. I was hoping this would change him and he actually agreed that if this didn't nothing would. Unfortunately months after the incident nothing has except for my patience, it's gone and my hope is gone to. There's nothing I can anymore I tried everything possible to help him threw this. Years of me helping him. Everything besides actually forcing him and you can't do that to a person because they have free will but I can't do anymore for him. So I started letting go of him to save myself. Drugs dont just destroy the addict, your loved ones suffer too."
