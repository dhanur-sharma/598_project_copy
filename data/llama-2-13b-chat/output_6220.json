        "Summarize the following story in first person: I've been dealing with a lot of anxiety for the past few years. I keep dropping classes and having to retake them. I decided to drop out of college and work on my mental health. The most memorable part of this was logging in to my account and seeing how much I owe in student loans. I have it deferred for now but I don't know how I'm going to pay it off. The strain of it is pretty overwhelming. I really hope to get my mental health together so that I can go back and get my degree. I'm taking meds right now that are helping somewhat. I plan on getting counseling. Maybe EMDR. I want to start going back to the gym and see if that helps. I definitely need to clean up my diet.  I want to find a decent paying job so that my husband doesn't feel like everything is resting on his shoulders. I want to feel like I'm contributing more to our relationship and our finances. Anxiety is really a bitch."
