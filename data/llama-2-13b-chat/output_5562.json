        "Summarize the following story in first person: There are very few times in your life where things can suddenly go from being very good to very bad in an instant. This is a story of one of those times in my life. That very night I had the good fortune to have the entirety of my tax return get deposited into my account. I decided to ask my friend if they wanted to hang out. They said yes and so I ventured to their house to hang out. Well I did have to leave at some point and ended up meeting a random man on the street. After we got to talking I decided to stop inside of a 7-11 to grab some cups. I was excited to hang out with a random stranger, but, then, things very suddenly changed. A man walked up to me, demanded my wallet, and, upon me giving him the wallet, stabbed me multiple times with a box cutter. There are very few more surprising things that can happen than suddenly finding yourself being the victim of a violent crime in a convenience store. Now as you can surmise by me typing this I did in fact survive. In fact, I wasn't seriously injured at all. However, now I got to spend my evening at a hospital around the corner. Instead of drinking with a random guy in the street now I was suddenly being put under for exploratory surgery. As anyone who has ever been in a car crash or gotten their identity stolen can attest to, once the shock and the trauma wear off, it just turns into a bunch of errands you have to run. After spending the next few months recovering there were a few things I had to do. I had to have an ultimately fruitless, albeit intimidating, interview with the police after the fact. The only other thing that I had to do, quite luckily, was, go through the rather Kafkaesque process of attempting to find a therapist. This, more than the interview, more than the stabbing, more than the recovery, more than the surgery, ended up being the most labor intensive part of the whole experience."

I have also learned a few valuable lessons about myself, about life, and about how to deal with adversity. One of the biggest things that I learned is that it is very important to have a good support system. I am very lucky to have a great group of friends and family that helped me get through this. Another thing I learned is that no matter what happens to you, it is important to keep a sense of humor. Even in the darkest of times, there is always something to laugh at. And lastly, I learned that life is full of unexpected twists and turns, but, that doesn't mean you should let it get you down. Instead, you should embrace the twists and turns, and, make the most of them."
