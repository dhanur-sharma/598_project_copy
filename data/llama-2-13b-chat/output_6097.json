        "Summarize the following story in first person: I still can't believe the situation I got involved with on the way home from work that day.  It was a really long day at work, with an early afternoon meeting that stretched well past dinner time.  By the time I was leaving work, I was physically and emotionally worn out on top of being very hungry.  I have a long commute home, it was raining, and I heard that traffic was particularly heavy for that time of night.  I decided to drive straight home and eat dinner at home instead of stopping.  As I entered the highway, the rain had started to come down almost torrentially, it was really difficult to see.  Immediately, I could tell that the driver in front of me was struggling.  She was going very slowly and seemed to be riding the white line.  As we neared where the traffic was supposed to pick up, she twice nearly drove off the side of the road.  I was worried about her, but also about my safety because her driving was unpredictable.  I wanted to pass her at my first opportunity, but I slowed down and gave myself some room in the meantime.  Once I could see the red brake lights from the traffic jam in front of us, I started to feel a little better because I knew the driver in front of me would have to stop and the traffic jam would keep her safe for a while.  I couldn't believe it when, just before we reached the traffic jame, she suddenly sped up and took a hard right turn right off the road and into the woods.  I swear I could hear her scream from the woods as I drove by.  I never saw myself as someone who would stopped to help in this situation, but something came over me and I just pulled over without thinking.  I ran into the woods and the scene was horrible.  The driver was an elderly woman and her small car was upside down and crunched really badly.  She was screaming in pain and I could tell she was really bloody.  I quickly called 911 and broke down the scene before I took a real hard look into the car.  The woman was in rough condition, couldn't move because the car was upside down, and she seemed absolutely terrified.  I knew I couldn't really help her, but my heart was breaking for her.  I laid down on the ground and held the woman's hand.  I tried to talk calmly with her until the ambulance and rescue workers came.  She begged to hold my hand again after she was removed.  I ended up riding with her in the ambulance until we got her to the hospital and she was sedated."

She had a long recovery ahead of her, and I knew she would be alone and scared, so I made the decision to stay with her for as long as she needed.  I was exhausted, emotionally drained, and still reeling from the shock of the whole situation.  But, I knew I couldn't leave her side until she was better.  As I write this, I am still in shock from that day.  I never would have believed that I would be in this situation, but I can't help but feel like I was meant to be there for her.  I know it was a long shot, but I hope that she will be okay and that she will know how much she was loved and cared for during that scary time."
