        "Summarize the following story in first person: This happened few months back when i went to my home country to attend my sister marriage, my grandpa who is 65 years old had some heart blockage and undergone surgery, may be due to his age and few other factors related to brain he didnt recovered well. he lost his memory too and failed to identify family and friends. i am very close to my grandpa, he always talks about me to me directly thinking that am some one. several times i told him that am your grand daughter about whom you are talking about, but he is not in  astage to identify me. i felt very embarrassed about my grandpa  situation. one day it was almost like his last day, we called our family members but to our surprise he recovered. we felt some miracle happened. but this happiness did not last long, one day early in the morning he left the house when no body was around him. i feel that is the worst day in our life. we searched for him whole day but no info about him. we even filed FIR in police station regarding his missing but we could not get him back. we searched every possible way , enquired every where. finally we got some info that one person identified my grandpa. so according to his info, we started tracing the way he followed. we found him in some cctv footages and followed that route videos but at a junction we missed him again. i think that is the last footage in which we saw my grandpa alive. after few more days, we got information from police regarding a old man who passed away with heart stroke. It took me almost 3-4 months to come out of his memories, because he is like pillar to our family. I love you forever grandpa."
