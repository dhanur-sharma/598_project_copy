        "Summarize the following story in first person: I hadn't seen or spent time with my sister in law in over a year. We were never close but I was looking forward to taking the time to get to know her better. I wanted to spend the time on this trip talking to her and getting closer. My sister died when I was jsut an infant and I always wondered what it would be like to have a sister, I have two brothers but it is not the same. I was nervous about the japanese hot spring because I knew that at least part of it was segregated and nude. I am not and have never been comfortable with my body, but I thought what a good experience. I also felt that I would try it and spend the rest of the time in the co-ed hot spring; spoiler there is not one. The first day I went in the hotspring on my own. I watched the women around me and tried to figure out what to do from what they need. I really got it on the third day. One day my sister and I went in together. We spoke, but it was awkward. That connection that I was looking for never happened or appeared. While we talked about her relationship, my marriage to her brother, and other parts of our selves we never really connected intimately. When the trip ended I felt farther from her than before the trip started. However, I learned that I can be comfortable around another woman or women; and be naked."
