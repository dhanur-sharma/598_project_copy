        "Summarize the following story in first person: Almost a year ago, my husband herniated his back and was referred to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Washington D.C. for surgery. We have two girls, and usually only travel within a day's driving distance, and have never been to the Capital before, so we were looking forward to this trip, especially since my Mom flew in to take care of the kids while I went with my husband to have the surgery. We left extremely early Thursday morning from our home, and our airplane touched down in Washington D.C. around 10 o'clock. This meant that we got to spend a good portion of the day exploring downtown D.C. before having to check into our hotel and report for surgery early the next morning. We left the airport via the train, and took the train all the way to the stop closest to the Capital. My ultimate goal was to end up at the Lincoln Memorial, because Abraham Lincoln has always been my favorite president, and I have always wanted to see that memorial. I first remember seeing the White House, and then continuing on to the Washington Memorial not far from that. We weren't actually able to see anything at the White House because they had a bunch of blockades blocking off the area and obscuring the view. After that we went to the WWII memorial and the Korean War Memorial, and then on to the Lincoln Memorial. I remember being incredibly impressed by the World War II memorial and just in awe of the memorial and everything our service members did to fight for freedom across the globe. I also remember being incredibly surprised that the Lincoln Memorial only had a statue in it. I really expected a whole museum or something, but it was only a statue! Still cool, just not what I expected it to be. The whole day was hot, we walked A LOT, and I really appreciated the guy selling water and Gatorade below the Washington Memorial- he probably really saved my sanity with that water!  I also found the best dark chocolate I've ever had at Prat downtown, and now every time my husband has to go back to the Capital for a follow-up appointment I make him pick some up for me. All in all, I had wanted to see everything I could, but hadn't expected to enjoy it as much as I did. It was really nice being able to explore and enjoy our nation's capital and history."
