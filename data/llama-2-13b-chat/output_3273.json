        "Summarize the following story in first person: About four months, my partner was accepted a new job on the west coast.  I've lived in the state where I was born all my life, so I was honestly really hesitant to pick up and move.  It would mean leaving behind my family, my friends, and my home.  But change can also be good, so we decided to take the plunge, pack up, and head west!  The pacing up part ended up being much more difficult that I thought it would be.  We've owned our home for almost a decade, and I guess I didn't realize quite how much stuff we'd accumulated over those years.  Not only did we have to think about limited space in the moving truck, our new apartment is much smaller than our old house.  It was honestly kind of emotional to shift through all of my things and decide was to keep, and what to just let go of.  It really brought into perspective how materially-oriented our lives can become.  I felt so attached to so many objects.  However, letting go of things I no longer need did start to get easier.  Especially when I knew my possessions were going to others who could get real use and joy out of them.  It was kind of freeing in a way.  It really helped me to set priorities and realize what's truly essential.  Walking into our apartment, it felt kind of freeing to be clutter free.  It was like a burden was lifted in a way, and we are ready to make a fresh start."
