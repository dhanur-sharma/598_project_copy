        "Summarize the following story in first person: So I and some old school friends decided to go to a music concert in LA. we stayed at a motel close to the event center. Everyone came together we hung out and had some fun, played VR games all night. the next morning we had breakfast and headed for our music concert. When it ended we headed home and said goodbyes and enjoyed the time we spent there. Some of us got together later that day. We had lunch, spaghetti to be precise. our little high school reunion was a memorable one. There\u2019s really no reason for that. \u201cGrease\u201d predates my high school years and bears no resemblance to my experience at a small, all-girls Catholic school in Manhattan. We tended to listen to the Cranberries, who were popular at the time, more than anything else. But the words seemed to capture the love we have for one another and the desire to stay a part of one another\u2019s lives. That said, we probably would have articulated our sentiments in full diagrammable sentences, or at least actual SAT vocabulary words. We were trying to remember the words to the song a few of our classmates wrote for our junior ring day, but I don\u2019t think we made it beyond recalling the first stanza. Back then, we didn\u2019t record everything on our phones, because we used the school payphone if we needed to make a call, so I don\u2019t have hopes of finding a recording! thank you."
