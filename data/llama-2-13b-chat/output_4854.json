        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was thinking that I might be in for boring weekend, due to the rain, but I got a call from a buddy of mine and he told me that he was in town for a licensing expo slash vacation and he wanted to see if I would be down for dinner.  He said he would be with some of the other participants, so at first it might be kind of lame, what with a bunch of people talking shop.  But, I always had a good time around Rick, so I was sure he would make it fun.    I got to the hotel just before  eight-thirty and left my car with the valet.  I was directed to the restaurant and one I got there, I spotted Rick and all of his colleagues.  There was four of them and they looked like they had gotten comfortable already.  I greeted Rick warmly and he introduced me to everybody.  We were all about the same age and, as I was surprised to see, we all had similar backgrounds.   I also was surprised that none of them wanted to talk shop.  They were there to have fun and get away from their jobs for a while; which is surprising these days.   Despite two women being in the group we talked about Formula One racing, mixed martial arts, how the Dolphins suck.  The conversation even got pretty raunchy, times.  Which I think all guys agree is kind of risky in the #metoo era.  We ate a lot (Asian fusion) and we drank a lot.  I actually drank a little too much and was worrying about the drive home.   The parry lasted for about two hours and when we were done, I was a little shaky.  Rick insisted that I stay in his room for the night because he had a double bed.  I took him up on the offer and after we said good night to the others, instead of going back to the room, we actually went of over to the bar and and had a few more drinks.  Rick and I had not spent too much time together since college; most of our contact had been through texts and social media.  But, it didn't take us long to fall into old habits.  Just like in the old days, one drink led to another.  By the time the bar was closing, both of us were shit faced.  A hotel employee had to help us up to the room.  After the doors closed behind us, I pretty much draw a blank as to what occurred after that."

I called her back and told her I had stayed over at Rick's.  She was pretty pissed, but I told her I would be home as soon as I could.  Rick and I stumbled down to the lobby and caught a cab back to my car.  I had to call a tow truck for my car because it had been towed.  My wife was already at home when I got there.  She was still pretty upset but we talked it out and she forgave me.   The weekend turned out to be a lot more fun than I thought it would be.  Thanks to Rick and his crew. "
