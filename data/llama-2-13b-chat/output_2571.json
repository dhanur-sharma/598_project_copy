        "Summarize the following story in first person: A few months ago, I moved back home. To the place where I knew the most about, the place where I was raised. It was a grueling two day drive, with multiple stops along the way. I saw things that I had not seen in years. It was wonderful to be able to show these things to my children. Luckily we had a nice selection of movies to watch for them. We ended having to get a hotel room to rest up after the first day of driving. That night, I got some of the best sleep I have had in a very long time. It felt good to get away from the place I was at before. That hot shower in the morning was one of the greatest feelings. We took off again on the road, after making sure we had everything. We continued onward to our destination. But had to stop after a few hours to take one of the kids to the Emergency Room. A few short hours later, with her prescription filled, we got back out on the road. Another six to seven hours of driving and we finally reached Oklahoma. I felt a major sense of accomplishment finally getting to where I was going."
