        "Summarize the following story in first person: In the end, my daughter ended her employment with that workplace. She was having trouble dealing with the crowds in that store, and she began college shortly afterward. She was happy at the job and made some friends among the employees, but she was also quite upset with how some customers treat retail employees. Personally, I'm glad she doesn't work there anymore, because she was texting me during her work hours, telling me she was feeling horrible about how customers treated her, and that it made her feel anxious. I hope she can eventually hold down a job, but I need for her to get a better hold on her mental state, and on her emotions. For now, college is enough responsibility. She needs some more time in therapy and some more time learning how to fulfill expectations in a workplace. She's studying nursing and needs to learn that she can't just pick up and leave because she's becoming overwhelmed. She needs to learn to deal with stress in a constructive manner and to stick things out, even when they are difficult.  I need to quit babying her. I need to stop rescuing her. I need to let her take her lumps. I also need to stop hovering over her. Finally, she needs to prioritize her work and school over her friends. Life's too short not to take school seriously, or a job."
