        "Summarize the following story in first person: My soul mate, my cat Ashton passed away four months ago. The first month was heart wrenching. Every time I look around I see a shadow of him everywhere. I missed him tailing me wherever I go. With a sinking heart I took out the batteries of the laser light, he loves chasing the red dot. What still trouble me was that I did not realized how much an impact we have on each other. Little did I know then that he was part of my world, but I am the world to him. It is when he tore my bedsheet and shredded only on my side of the bed that I realized that he was actually trying to dig for me. He could not understand why I left him for five weeks, which would almost be half a year in cat\u2019s years. It was uncanny, my comforter looks unruffled but underneath, you can see the torn bedsheet. When I pass by a cat on my walks, I always made eye contact and think about Ashton. He was incredibly smart. I totally missed him at the window going out to work and his goodbyes and greetings at the garage door downstairs. I thought we might get another cat one day. Not now, I am still sad. I do continuously read about cats everyday on my iPad, and look at animal shelters online. I also check out Craig\u2019s list periodically. I love and missed Ashton and where he goes a part of me goes with him."
