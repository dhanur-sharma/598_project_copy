        "Summarize the following story in first person: In early 2019, I learned that my grandmother was ill. She had not been feeling well for a good while, and after a visit to the hospital we found out she was in sepsis. This is a very serious infection of the blood that is very hard for elderly people to fight. I was in a panic. I was so sad and I had no way of getting down to Florida to visit her due to financial reasons. My aunt and uncle flew my mother down there and I had to sit home and wait to hear what was happening. My mom called me with updates throughout the week. As much as they tried to treat the infection with antibiotics, nothing was working. She was in pain and suffering. It was time for her to make a tough choice; stopping the medications that were keeping her alive. I received a tearful phone call from my mother telling me she was entering hospice care. This was grueling information, because it meant I was not going to see my grandma ever again. I was heartbroken. She passed away three days later. I was able to make it down to attend the funeral, and I've been very sad ever since. I miss her so much."
