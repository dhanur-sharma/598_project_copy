        "Summarize the following story in first person: 1 month ago, I went to my cousin's party that was 15 years old and it was almost our whole family spent a lot of things. reunited friends, united families and great dances, there were DJs,serenades, declarations, dedications, the valts, it was all very great the only thing that surprised us all in a terrifying way was that in front of the place where we were celebrating there was a highway and almost right after the party was over an accident with several cars. apparently one of them had a mechanical failure and he was derailed which led him to crash or with another car very violently and the others who could not stop in time also suffered damages. leaving 9 wounded including his nieces, it was an experience that we will never forget. After all, we will see in the news what happened that night. I always remember what happened. For my part, I'm going to therapy. I go for long walks. I get distracted at work thinking about what happened. I see my family and I'm afraid it will happen the same. Although my family stays together and does not talk about it, I know they still remember it. My cousin should be the protagonist of that night I talk a lot with her. I still think about all the things we saw that night and that's why we stay together. and I still try not to think about it. to continue with our lives."
