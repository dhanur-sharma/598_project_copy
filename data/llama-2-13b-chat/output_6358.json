        "Summarize the following story in first person: My son has now been in college for over half a semester.  I have gotten use to him not being around everyday.  He is really having a good time.  He has only come home once or twice and that was so I could take him out to eat and get some groceries.  I text with him a day or two out of the week.  I am trying not to bother him to much.  So far he is getting all A's and B's.  He says that he seems to have less work now than he did in college.  He doesn't really have to study much because most things come natural to him.  He just understands math, science, etc.  He is hanging out with a lot of people but doing any partying.  He has no interest in drinking or going to parties.  We got together for lunch with weekend.  We had some good food and good conversation.  He has a little more than a month of school left and then he will be done for the first semester.  After the first semester he will already technically be a sophomore since he placed out of 11 credit hours.  I am looking forward to him coming home for the semester break and spending some time together.  It has taken some getting use to him not being home, but I have.  Thank good for texting and cell phones."
