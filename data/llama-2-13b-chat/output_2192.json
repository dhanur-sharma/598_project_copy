        "Summarize the following story in first person: In the past month, I had the best birthday celebration in my whole life. My friends and I took a trip to Universal Studio. It was the most memorable moment of my life because I couldn't forget this trip. This trip was so special that I wanted to relive every moment of it. My friends surprised me with this trip because they paid for everything. While I was at Universal Studio, my friends and I visited a lot of places. The best place I visited was the Harry Potter Land. My friends celebrated my birthday at the Harry Potter restaurant, which was unique. The moment I saw the big cake coming my way, I saw 35 candles were sticking on the cake. I remembered when I blew all the candles, my friends laughed at me because it took me 5 turns to blew all the candles out. I couldn't stop laughing at myself because I was happy and cried at the same time. I haven't had such a celebration for a long time, and I was thankful that all my friends took the time and money to celebrate my birthday. I also remembered I got a free wand at the Ollivanders' Wand shop because it was my birthday. I immediately felt so special and joy that I was the happiest person in the whole universe. I couldn't forget how this birthday celebration was important to me because it was the happiest moment I had."
