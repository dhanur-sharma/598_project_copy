        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was around the time when I completed my graduation and was looking for a job. I just had a few hundred dollars to support myself. I was hunting for a job. I was at the end of my resources. I did not have much to maneuver around. I took up a part-time job at a hotel for valet parking to support myself. This is a tedious job and the pay is also very simple.  Meanwhile, i got news that my pop has been admitted with chest pain. My morale was blown to pieces. I felt as if I dont have a shoulder to rest. I could picture the bewildered state of my mom and sister. My grandpa will be at his wits end on hearing this. I felt as if there was a big load on my chest, suffocating me, I felt very hard to take a breath in. I felt as if i was ready to pass out. I wasn't able to process this information. It took a few minutes to get hold of myself. I took a cup of coffee and gathered my thoughts, I was planning to go home around next week after i land a job or had something near to closure."

I thought about my dad and how he has been my mentor and a great support. I thought about how he would be feeling and what he would say in this situation. I was filled with so much of emotions and i could feel the tears in my eyes. I felt very helpless and at a loss. I had no idea how i was going to deal with this situation. I was very worried about my dad's health and was scared about the future. I was feeling very low and dejected."
