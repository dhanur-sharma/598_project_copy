        "Summarize the following story in first person: One of the most memorable events of my life was the day my son was born four years ago.  My husband and I had struggled with infertility for 3 years and the fact that we were able to get pregnant and have a child was the most happiest day of our lives. I remember when I went into labor. Even though I was in pain the whole experience seemed so surreal to me. I felt so blessed that i was able to experience labor pain since I thought I was never going to have that experience.  I still couldn't believe when the doctor told me, \"you are going to have this baby today, you are in active labor\".  When my son finally made his grand entrance to the world, I was in awe! He was perfect and healthy and my dream of becoming a mother finally came true.  I remember that right away he looked at me and began to look for food. I remember smelling him and looking at his tiny feet. He was so tiny and beautiful and I was his mama! I turned and look at my husband and he also had the same expression on his face. It was very surprising to see him crying being that he I had never seen him cry.  I still remember this day so vivid and seeing his little newborn face. It was a day I will cherish and always think as the best day of my life."
