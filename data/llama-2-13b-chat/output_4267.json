        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last week i was working my usual night time shift with the usual crew. We were doing some construction on a particularly busy road, so everything had to be done at night when we would not be disrupting traffic flow too much. It was a pretty involved job since we had to dig up the road to extend the sewers so that it would connect to the new apartment complex the city wanted built. It was job to stand at one end of the work area holding a sign to alert anyone coming towards us that the road was closed. Typically, this was a pretty boring job, and most people knew what was going on so they avoided the area anyways. This night however, was different. It was around 2am when I started hearing some really loud, drunken laughing coming from down the road. After a little bit, I saw a group of 6 rather large men stumbling down the road, walking towards me. The group definitely noticed me, because I saw one of them point right at me as they got closer, their laughter kind of quieting down and being replaced by some angry shouting. Our work site was completely blocking their path and they didn't seem too happy about it. As they got closer, I got nervous. I quietly signaled to some more of the crew to come over and back me up in case things got messy. As they got closer, I began to fear for the worst. It is not easy to reason with drunks, and these guys were big guys. They could easily beat me up if they wanted to. For whatever reason, once they were about 15 feet away, they stopped in their tracks, kind of stood there for a bit looking puzzled. We locked eyes. After a short delay, they turned right around, and walked down an adjacent street. I let out a huge sigh of relief, and we continued working through the night without interruption."
