I finally dragged myself out of bed to go to school, I was not a happy camper. I fed myself because of course that's the right thing to do, just so I would have energy for the day. I got in my car and drove to school slowly, not wanting to get to where I was going. I got to the class to take the test knowing it wasn't going to go well, but I powered through it anyway. I thought oh boy that was horrible, I knew I had failed. So I packed up my things and went home, feeling even worse than before. I got an email regarding my grade, I did not even want to open it. I finally opened it after 30 minutes of just staring at it. I was shocked, I actually passed! I needed to celebrate, so I called my friend. We went to go get coffee and something to eat. I told her how I knew I would fail but somehow I passed. She laughed and said yeah that happens all the time."
