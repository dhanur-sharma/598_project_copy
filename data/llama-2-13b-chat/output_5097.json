        "Summarize the following story in first person: so after not talking to my ex for almost 2 years, i accidentally butt dialed her. she called me back a few hours later and we started talking. she mentioned how she missed me but never tried reaching out because she thought i hated her and all that. i told her no that it wast the case at all and that i just had left her alone after the break up because it seemed like she wanted space. so we talked a long time over the next week or so and decided to hang out. she came over my place and we hung out a few hours and had fun. next day she messages saying how she enjoyed and missed that and would really like to try dating again. i said ok but lets take it slowly since one of the main reasons we stopped dating in the first place was the fact she would constantly make plans and then cancel. she would do this time after time and i got annoyed since i dont like making plans and then have them cancel out right before or not even be told til hours after. so i kind of had a feeling this would happen again in the back of my mind. and of course, it did. a week later she talked about her mom going away and not having to do that much for the week her mom was gone. it sounded like a good thing but again, in my back of my mind i had a feeling all this was just going to end like normal. and once again, of course it did. her mom left on a Friday and we had made plans for Saturday. well Saturday came and went. then Sunday. i finally hear from her on Monday with a story about how her grandmother got sick and she was in the hospital since Friday and all these things. mind you, she had been posting on social media all weekend and nothing mentioned this at all. i said ok no problem, lets try Wednesday. she agreed and we talked some more, but in my mind i knew this was not going to happen. and again, nope. the day came and went and i finally hear from her Thursday that she was so tired that she couldn't get out of bed. i said uh ok, and then out of the blue she comes up with that she doesn't think she can do this relationship cause she just cant seem to ever get time to come see me and how its not fair and just all kinds of things. i pretty much just gave up on her for the second time then."
