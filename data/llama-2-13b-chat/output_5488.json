        "Summarize the following story in first person: It's exciting. Getting a job with one of the big boys means that all the hard work and the sleepless nights are finally paying off. That it was all worth it. That I made the right decision.  I can't believe it's only been three months since I got hired.  It was hectic right after I got the news.  All of a sudden I needed to find a new place to live halfway across the country. In a city I'd only been in once. That's crazy isn't it? Coming down for the interview was the first time I ever set foot in the city itself.  I didn't know anyone here at all. Hell, I didn't even know where to get a decent cup of coffee. At least I got the coffee thing figured out now.  That's when it all really set in for me. Once I had found a place to live and found a place that I could get decent coffee.  I didn't have much time to really think about it until then I guess.  The job is pretty much what I expected.  In the back of my mind I was worried that I was going to settle in after orientation and realize that I'd just made a huge mistake. A mistake that I'd signed a contract committing to making every single day for the next five years.  Including a no compete clause so if I'd really hated it then I would have been in trouble.  All in all though I'm happy. The work isn't as interesting as I would like it to me. It's not as boring as it could be though so silver linings. The folks in the office have been very welcoming so far and the office itself is amazing.  I loved my desk chair so much that I want out and bought one for myself."
