        "Summarize the following story in first person: Currently, I am on a committee to help implement sustainability issues on campus. I was given this opportunity because I am good at reporting regularly to donors. This position came with a slight raise and requires me to work with someone I don't usually work with. I am very grateful for this opportunity. In the last 2.5 months we have met several times and have reported to our donors both in person and via email correspondence. Sustainability is not my area of expertise but I am learning a lot about this topic and am grateful for this opportunity. I have done some research for this project and have reported my findings to my committee co-chair and my donors.  I just recently did research on creating a sustainable garden/playground on campus. I can't say I enjoy this project. I can't say I enjoy working with this person. This is a learning experience on many levels. I am learning to take the high road in interpersonal interactions. I am learning to set boundaries at work with someone I never had to work with before. I am using my skills to keep balance in my interactions. I am using my skills at research.  Again, I am grateful for this opportunity."
