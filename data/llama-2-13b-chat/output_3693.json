        "Summarize the following story in first person: About three months ago I had been putting in a lot of overtime at my job.  I was surprised and excited that my employer recognized all of my hard work and gave me a nice bonus.  My boss encouraged me to take some time off and go and do something to relax and get away.  I talked to my husband and we decided to use the money to take a rare trip home to visit my parents.  Since moving to California I don't get back to the Midwest often to see them.  It was during the summer when we visited .  The weather was hot but cool in the evenings.  We spent our days having nonstop fun and taking in some of the local areas that I had not visited since I was a young child.  We enjoyed evenings sitting outside by their fire pit.  One evening while sitting out there the dark sky became filled with fireflies.  It reminded me of my childhood and catching them with my parents and siblings.  Now that I live in a big city I don't see them anymore.  I was surprised by how nostalgic it made me feel to see them.  I even ran around the yard catching some of them.  The week flew by but was the rest and relaxation that my body and mind needed.  I enjoyed the time catching up with my parents and vowed that I would not let so much time pass between visits.  My husband enjoyed seeing me so relaxed and getting to see where I grew up.  I think I even wiped away a few tears the day we left.  I'm already looking forward to the next trip."
