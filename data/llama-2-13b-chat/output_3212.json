        "Summarize the following story in first person: Well this was not too long ago, i believe it was middle of March. It was a Sunday morning and I had just woken up and was laying on my couch. My wife was still asleep in the room and my kids were playing in their room. I then heard a loud thud come from my kids room. I called out to them and asked what was that sound. Then my son says that my daughter, Piper, was on the ground acting weird. So I got up and rushed in there and seen her face down on the ground behind the door. My son then says he thought she had some legos in her mouth. She was shaking and eyes closed not breathing. I started to panic and scream. I called for my wife and as each moment passed I thought I was loosing here. I tried to feel in her mouth, but had trouble opening her jaw and could not find anything. My wife called 911 while I was trying various things as she continued not to respond. I sat down holding her upside down and she was turning blue and I began to panic more. I tried one last time to see if I could find something in her throat and could not. Some emergency service folks and sheriff had arrived and as they were coming up to our doors my daughter started to cry out. At this point we knew she wasn't joking, thankfully so! But what had happened and the hospital confirmed is that she had had a seizure. She had them before but I have never witnessed one whereas my wife has so my in experiencing caused a lot of trauma for everyone."
