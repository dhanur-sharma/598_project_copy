        "Summarize the following story in first person: my cousin's wedding went amazingly well. She had friends over from all parts of the country. It almost felt like a reunion for her because most of these friends were from her college days. There was this friend in particular named Susan, who had been dating a guy she met online. Luckily for her, the guy was living in the same location where the wedding took place. So she decided to kill two birds with one stone and invite the guy over for the wedding for them to have their first meeting. After the wedding, my cousin had an after party at a pool of which few friends were in attendance including Susan and her new date. Susan could not swim, however, her new date convinced her to swim with him, and he'd keep her safe from deep waters. In a bid to teach her how to swim, he dumped her in deep waters. She struggled to no avail and the new date did not come her to rescue. Luckily for her, a life guard came around and saved her. She nearly lost her life all because she placed her trust in a not so known person.  After this incident. I swore to learn how to swim of which I can now. I also figured that no one was to be trusted fully."
