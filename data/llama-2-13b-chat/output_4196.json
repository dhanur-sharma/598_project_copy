        "Summarize the following story in first person: My dad and I met in San Francisco, it has been a very long time since we met (more than 5 years if I recall correctly). We rented a car and to our surprise we got a good SUV, in fact they upgraded us so the trip was already starting on a good note. This trip was magical, unlike any other past trips we've been to. This was all nature and every scenery was different. It left strong impression on both of us. Further more my dad was super proud of how I planned the trip and that we managed to be in all the places we wanted (and then some!). We enjoy the restaurants and specifically a Chinese restaurant in Vegas - we kept going there for the days we stayed in Vegas. We took nearly 3K pictures and sadly the video we thought we took didn't work. Apparently the camera had a malfunction and even though it indicated it was recording, it didn't so all but two days of videos are gone. However, as I said, 3K photos are more then enough to conserve the memory of the trip. Some key highlights of the trip was when we walked in Monument Valley and encountered a snake, luckily we weren't in its path but both of use dislike snakes - we do respect them though. Another \"unfriendly\" incident was also in the Monument Valley are, next to our hotel there was a restaurant - I think it was called the Three Amigos but can't be sure. There was a centipede that my dad almost step on as well as street dogs which were super scary, reminded me of the movie Cujo by a book of Stephen King. Speaking of that restaurant - it was super good! So \"homey\" and my dad really loved the food style. In fact he was positively surprised by it."

One of the best experiences was a helicopter ride over the Grand Canyon, my dad is afraid of heights but he really enjoyed it. We also had a great time in Las Vegas and the shows we saw were amazing. The trip was amazing and I will always treasure it. I know my dad was super happy to spend that time with me and I was happy to spend it with him as well. I wish we could do it again.\n\n"
