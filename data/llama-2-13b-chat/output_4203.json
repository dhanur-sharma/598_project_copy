        "Summarize the following story in first person: A very memorable memory for me that happened recently was watching my sister give birth. It was very exciting when i first figured out she was pregnant. I was so happy for her as i knew this was something she had been wanting for awhile. The day it came finally for her to give birth was so exciting. I loved watching her go through it all. Seeing her be strong for everyone and doing the best she could to bring this life into the world. It was truly amazing to see it all happening. She let me stay in the room with her to watch her give birth. I literally cried seeing her do this because I knew all her dreams were coming true. This was exactly what she had always wanted. When he was born I loved seeing the relief on her face. Finally her little boy was there and she was more than thrilled. It was a very happy time and we all cried happy tears. He was a big ole baby but so precious. I wouldn't of traded that day for anything."
