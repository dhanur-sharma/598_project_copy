        "Summarize the following story in first person: Four months ago, I applied for a Ph. D. position at a major NYC university. I hve worked really hard for the past ten years on my education with the goal of getting a Ph. D. AFter receiving my appliction, the university only granted me a M.A. position. I already have two M.A.'s and do not see the value in another one. Additionally, i cannot afford to spend more on another M.A. and this would be a HUGE strain on me financially. I have to figure out what i want to do. I spoke to a counselor about the idea of reapplying. I have to determine if it is worth re-applying and if i should apply somewhere else. This rejection was incredibly tough on me . I have spent my whole career in education and learning for this point. Not getting into my PH. D program which was my dream was really tough. I am worried that it will knock my confidence too much for reapplying. I am going to try my best not to let my emotional get in the way."
