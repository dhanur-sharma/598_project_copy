        "Summarize the following story in first person: Six months ago, I was at work when my wife called. That she had a surprise news for me and she isn't going to tell me till I'm back from work. I persuaded her to reveal what is but she insisted that she isn't going to tell me over the phone and she hung up. After receiving her call, I finished up with the work I have on my table and I started going home. On getting home, she divulged the surprise news to me that she's 3 months pregnant and I was extremely excited. So, I told her to get prepared because we'll be travelling tomorrow to visit my family since it's been long we visited them. We woke up very early the next day and we went to the park to board a bus. I had a long road trip with my children which was very tiring and stressful. But eventually, we got there. We were welcomed by all and after settling down, I told them that we are expecting a new baby! My big sister was so happy about it and talked to my hears that she has something to discuss with me. I left my wife and His brother in the sitting room while i took a work with my big sister. She discuss with me her new business she's about to open. And she wanted me to introduced this to my wife. Later that day we had a nice time spending with each other and all day was fun."
