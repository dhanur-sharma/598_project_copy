        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was late summer and I was still in local baseball recreational league for adults. The team was late for the game as our bus was stuck in the busy Long Beach traffic of the early summer. The weather was light and gray and it was the kind of day where you wake up sleepy no matter the amount of hours that you slept the night before. The team had been thrilled to be here in the first place. We were subpar team the year before and all of a sudden we were at the top of our game being able to compete with the best teams in the district. I had spent the night before just watching old dodger games trying to get pitching tips from the great Hideo Nomo. I was raised watching him and wanted to pitch just like him. My coaches told me otherwise though and let me know it is not a good thing because it hurts your back in the long run. We had arrived at Milikan Park. I didn't want to get off the bus as I was nervous as can be. We went in the locker rooms and I dressed up and was ready to pitch. We got on the field and surprisingly the stands were half empty. I was told that the fans weren't being let in because of a riot that happened there. Once the stands filled up I was up to pitch at the top of the 1st inning. I got on the mound. Surprisingly I was ready. I struck out the side in the first inning. I feel like overall my past history of failures lead me this inning and the rest of the game. I was tired of failing at all I tried and I wanted something new for a change. At the bottom of the ninth we were down 3-2 as the relief pitcher had let in 3 runs at the top of the inning. We managed to battle back and win it off a two run blast by my childhood friend Jim. It was what we used to dream of as kids. Winning anything together. It didn't happen in the pros but it felt like it did. We never made it to the majors, so this is the best memory I have of the game of baseball and it happened 3 months ago."
