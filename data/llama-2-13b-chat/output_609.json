        "Summarize the following story in first person: I have been dating Michael for over two years now.  I am 100% sure he is the one.  I really could not be happier with him.  We have talked about our future and I know he wants to get married.  So, I've just been waiting for when he's going to propose.  I find myself getting impatient with it but in the end it doesn't matter!  We recently went to a football game together and I got it in my head that he would propose there.  It didn't happen.  We had a good time though.  I found myself disappointed and irritable because of something I thought was going to happen.  I wish I could get rid of being impatient and just enjoy myself.  He is what I want, regardless of a title.  The game and my disappoint made me realize how I was thinking.  I kept looking for little clues.  And it wasn't fair to him to expect something."
