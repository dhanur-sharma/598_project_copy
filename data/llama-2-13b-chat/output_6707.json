        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last week, I had a very long and tiring day. I had been looking forward to coming home to relax after my shift at the hospital. I picked up my son from the babysitter and I could already tell that he was in a mood. I get him into his car seat all while he is screaming his head off. Man, I had such a headache from working all day and this is the last thing I wanted to deal with. He screamed the whole way home. I thought all this fussing was because he was hungry, so I quickly got dinner ready. I tried sitting him down at the dinner table to eat but he refused and said he wanted to eat in front of the TV. I told him that was not OK and reminded him of my dinner time rules. Well, the arguments went on and on. Finally, it was bath and bed time. My son was still argumentative when I was tucking him in and didn't want to go to bed. I finally got him to agree to go to sleep but then he said the strangest thing. He said, \"If you don't have a past, you can't have a future.\" I was shocked when I heard this come out of my son's mouth. Where did he learn this? I don't think I've ever said that before. I asked him to elaborate on his statement but he was already falling asleep."
