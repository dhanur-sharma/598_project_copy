        "Summarize the following story in first person: I hate riding in cars. Being in one for more than an hour drives me stir crazy. There's barely any room to move and nowhere else to go. Still, Ryan convinced me to go on a road trip. It took a lot of convincing before I caved it. I still can't believe he managed to change my mind. I especially can't believe that I ended up having a blast! But I set some ground rules: no stopping in really small towns (they make me nervous), and breaks every couple of hours to stretch our legs. We went two months ago, planned around Thanksgiving and a visit to Ryan's family in Minneapolis.  One of the first places we stopped was this cheese emporium in Wisconsin. It's sounds cheesy (ha!), but was pretty cool. Products were a little overpriced, but they had some cheeses that I've never seen elsewhere. But the real highlight was the restaurant inside -- very menu item involved some kind of cheese, even drinks I had this shake/smoothie filled with small chunks of creamy cheesecake. It reminded me of boba and pudding drinks. The cheesecake was souffle-like, not dense and heavy. It was heavenly. I've probably had my fill of cheese for the next few months though. We also stopped in Madison, WI, which I've been to a couple times before back in college. It's an adorable college town. Despite being the state's capital, it still has a cool, quirky vibe. One of my favorite online clothing stores is based out of there. We came across this board game store that had every kind of board game you can imagine. They also had copies of every game for people to test out and play before buying. It was cool seeing all the games I loved as a kidI'm really glad Ryan convinced me to go. Maybe we'll take another road trip this summer."
