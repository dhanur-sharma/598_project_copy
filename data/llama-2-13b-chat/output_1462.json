        "Summarize the following story in first person: M son, my youngest was to enter PS3 this year. It was both exciting and terrifying as I knew he is my last child and I had a mix of feelings. I wanted it to be wonderful, yet it was hard to let him go and know that he was moving on and progressing in life to an older more mature age for a young child. I knew he would be in PS3 all day long and wanted it to be something he loved and looked forward to. He is very affectionate and calm and I had a positive attitude overall about everything. I was a bit worried as he had not been fully potty trained for poop yet and that was a requirement. He also loves his blankie and I wondered if that would be an issue. So he started this week, yesterday actually. All went well and I am very relieved. Two days ago we had a day of adaptation where parents went in with their child to get to know the feel of the classroom and what a day at school would be like. He did well yesterday and enjoyed time with new friends and came home happy. He was very hungry after a long day, and tired. So he went to bed early than normal, which is good as that was another expectation I had. He was a bit fussy this morning, as he has to get up earlier than normal, but did well overall. He was happy when I left him in the classroom. I am so relieved and thankful that this has been a relatively easy transition and hope it stays that way."
