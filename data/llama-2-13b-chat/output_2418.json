        "Summarize the following story in first person: My company had a few positions open up within our organization and I really wanted to get promoted. After mentioning this to one of my work friends he suggested that I brush up on a few of my qualifications to really give myself a good shot. After speaking to my immediate manager as well I thought that this would be the correct course to take. After putting in my application/resume to make sure I get interviewed I got to work. There were only a couple of online courses that I had to take but these really prepared me for the qualification tests. This took about three weeks to complete but after I finished my confidence was really high. The day of the interview I prepared myself as much as I could. Getting a good night's sleep as well as buying a new outfit to wear really had me feeling good. I went into the interview that included my immediate manager as well as the district manager. During the interview I felt somewhat of a weird vibe from the district manager and he implied that I was not experienced enough yet. I pointed out the qualifications that I had recently obtained and was told that these were standard and that everybody had them. There was little that I could do except answer their questions and sell myself as much as I could. I pointed out that I had strong performance reviews for the last year and that I was 100% up to the challenge. This was not good enough though I was told to apply next time this position comes open as it should only be 6-9 months before another team member is added. This was pretty sad for me but after having lunch with my work friend he helped me to see things in a new light and be happy that I have these added skills for future use."
