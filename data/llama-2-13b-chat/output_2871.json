        "Summarize the following story in first person: My son is still in school but has been on vacation for the past month. He had decided to take a class during the summer, so his vacation didn't start when my other kids vacation had started. We ended up waiting for him to be off so we could go on vacation. Our vacation was pretty short and ended up only actually doing something for a week. It was more of a stay cation. But it was still fun and we did a few things close to where we live. I was a little frustrated and surprised that he wanted to take this class, but it was with the teacher that he really wanted. So, in the end it was fine and my family was able to adjust. It can be hard to keep up with his schedule because its always changing and he usually needs someone to take him to and from school due to lack of parking. So I have had to plan for that, and to make sure my schedule is flexible so I can either take him to school or pick him up. Its a good thing his college is close, or this type of thing would never work. I am so proud of him and how hard he has worked toward his civil engineering degree. So even though I have to deal with the transportation issues, high cost, and the challenging schedule, I think its been worth it. I'm so happy he has this opportunity and I am able to support him through it. My parents never sent me to college or even really thought about my education. So I'm glad that I am able to do this for my son and be there to help him continue his education."
