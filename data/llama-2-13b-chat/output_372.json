        "Summarize the following story in first person: Tirelessly searching, wondering I looked for something new. I needed to get a job to pay rent for having to move back home for a little while. I got an interview before but I wasnt qualified to work there even though they offered me the job. But at last the store near me got a new manager! I applied there online and called in the store and they were actually interested in me. I had an interview coming up and was so nervous. As far as I knew they didnt pay much but it was so close I was willing to try. I got there and interviewed briefly and turns out I'm just what they needed. I asked how much the pay was and it was more then expected! I couldn't believe how lucky I got. I immediately was on the internet planning my future purchases with the extra money I would get. I realized I had to save up as well though for a new car. But I was so excited to have my own money, but nervous as well. I was nervous to feel ill and still have to go to work. But I'm hoping as long as I keep washing my hands I will be okay. In the end it's a really good opportunity."
