        "Summarize the following story in first person: A recent time in my life that was memorable for me was when my father died. When my father died, it hurt me and my family. My father was fairly young when he died at the age of 47. It was a hard time for everyone after he passed away. My father died about 6 months ago due to diabetes. He was a diabetic for a long time, but then he had a stroke, and it made his condition even worse. My father was a healthy man a few years back, but he liked to drink alcohol.. mainly beers. After work, he would always drink a few beers to relax. After my father had the stroke, he past away a few months after. It really hurt me to see him die fairly young, and it devastated my family. I could not function properly after he died, and it left me depressed. It left me to a point where I started drinking myself, just to let the pain go of him not being here anymore. I had to tell myself that drinking was not the answer, and he would want me to move on, and continue to make him proud by being successful in life. It was a very painful time in my life. I got through it with help of friends and family, and now I try my best to make my father proud, by being the best man I can be."
