        "Summarize the following story in first person: 3 months ago my daughter was born at 5:00 am in the morning.  it was one of the best days of my life with lots of ups and downs. my wife struggled with the entire pregnancy and also with the delivery. we were in the hospital for over 36 hours before she was born. the doctor became very concerned about the baby's health as well as my wifes. finally, an emergency c section was needed and my daughter as born.  she didn't cry when she was born which concerned everyone and finally the doctor unwrapped the cord from her neck and she belt out a loud cry and it was the best thing i ever heard in my life because i know she was safe.  it was a whirlwind 2 days, but afterwards it was beyond worth it. my daughter struggled afterwards with feeding but after a while she got the hang of it. my wife was in a great amount of pain and wasn't allowed to hold the baby for a few hours as she was taken care of by the doctor. this was very emotional for her because she wanted to hold her baby. afterwards she held the baby and was beyond happy. my daughter opened her beautiful eyes and was so happy to see her parents.  my son was happy to meet his new baby sister and kissed her forehead. he wanted to hold her but since he is only 2, wasnt the best idea. he also held her hand."
