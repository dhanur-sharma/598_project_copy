        "Summarize the following story in first person: So a week ago I finally got my visa to go to Australia!   It was such a long journey, but really this is just the beginning.  After my husband moved to America and we went through that whole ordeal of getting his green card I knew it what it would be like getting my visa, I'm glad that's finally over.  Eleven long months of applications and waiting to finally get my visa, but it was worth the wait.  I can't believe that we're actually moving to Australia.  I know it seems weird that my husband would move to America, just for us to both move over to Australia a year later.  Honestly it just seems like the whole situation will be better once we get over there as long as we don't get burned up by the fires, lol.  We began shopping for houses a few weeks ago when we felt like my visa would be approved, but we're still not quite sure where we're going to move to exactly.  I think somewhere along the east coast, because I'm pretty sure there's not much else west of that.  Speaking of learning I might need to get a book or something.  I don't even know what kind of money they use, and I just realized I'll have to learn to drive on the other side of the car and the other side of the road.  This whole move seems like a daunting task but I know it'll be worth it.  Even the kids are excited to go.  They think they'll get to have a crocodile as a pet!  Not sure how I'm gonna let them down on that one, but they'll have a lot better experience growing up there.  Anyway, this is really just the beginning of a big new chapter in our lives."
