        "Summarize the following story in first person: About four months ago, I had a baby girl. Long ago, I decided to name her after my grandmother in her memory. Throughout my pregnancy, butterflies would alight on me when I went for walks in the park. This had never happened to me before when I walked in the exact same park for years on end. After my grandmother passed, I would always see butterflies when I went to visit her gravesite, so I felt it was her spirit contacting me and letting me know she was around. My pregnancy was a bit of a difficult one, but I always knew it would be ok because my grandmother was near. I went into the hospital about four months ago and gave birth to a baby girl. It was a different delivery, and I didn't get to see the baby right away after she was born. The nurse who was caring for me assured me that my baby was doing just fine and looked like a \"Sophie\" in her opinion. Sophie was my grandmother's name, and it was the name I had planned on giving the baby in her honor. I felt overwhelmed with emotion. Right then I knew that my grandmother was with me again. How could the nurse suggest the exact same name? I hadn't told anyone there, nor had my husband. When I finally got to see my little girl, I saw my grandmother in her eyes. If I did believe in reincarnation, I would surely say that my grandmother's spirit is with my daughter. This is so significant to me because it gives me comfort that just like my grandmother was with me throughout my pregnancy, she will also be with my daughter throughout her difficulties in life. She will watch over my daughter just as she watched over me all these years."
