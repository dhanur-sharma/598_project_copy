        "Summarize the following story in first person: This past week has seemed like the longest week of my life. I have known my mother in law for quite some time now. We have had our differences over the years, but overall we have had a pretty good relationship. She was recently diagnosed with advanced stage cancer. She has been admitted to a rehab home for constant care. I went to see her and make sure I could make her as comfortable as possible. When I first walked into her room, she could not see me. I burst into tears, and left her room for a moment to pull myself together. After all, I could not let her see me in a moment of weakness. She needed all the positivity she can get. I went into her room and brought her a drink she loves, and a bouquet of roses (which she has always adored). We carried on a conversation as if nothing was wrong, and it was a normal day. With each passing day her skin grew a little more dry and pale. Her voice started sounding quieter as well as soft. I knew her time was near, and that really got to me sometimes. My mental health had drastically suffered since finding out about her cancer. I started to realize all of the things I used to fret about, suddenly became so small and irrelevant. I found myself reflecting on what I would do when she finally passed. Did I do everything in my power to leave a lasting impression on her as she passes into the next life?"

I felt so helpless, but I also felt a sense of peace knowing she was comfortable and well cared for. I knew I did everything I could to make her last days as comfortable as possible. I spent so much time with her and I cherished every moment. Even though I was struggling with my own grief, I tried my best to be strong for her. I hope she knew how much she meant to me, and how much I loved her. I wish I could turn back time and spend more time with her, but I know I did everything I could. I will miss her so much, but I am so grateful for the time we had together."
