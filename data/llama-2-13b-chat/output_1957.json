        "Summarize the following story in first person: Three months ago I made the hardest decision of my life. I had been working at Fairfield Properties for 12 years. I started there right out of college. I had made strong friendships with many of my coworkers. I was happy there, I was safe there. I had a great deal of job security. I was making decent money for the job I was doing. The only thing was that I wanted more. I wanted power, I wanted responsibility, I needed more. Fairfield properties couldn't offer that to me no matter how hard I worked. There was absolutely no room for advancement in that company. I had to make a really tough decision. Should I quit my safe and comfortable job and take the chance of finding a new job that I hated? Ultimately I decided I had no choice but to try and find something better. I was so scared, but I started a new job at a new company. Now, 2 months later, I can say it was the best thing I ever did. I love the new job. I have responsibility. I have the possibility of making more. I am so happy!"
