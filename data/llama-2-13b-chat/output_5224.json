        "Summarize the following story in first person: A few weeks ago I was a spectator at a major league baseball game and I was just visiting for the time. This was my first baseball event ever, so I imagined that it would be a chill experience. For the first eight innings, that was exactly what it was. My team was up by eight runs, and in a few minutes the game would be over. However, we some some anger coming from one of the opposing team's pitchers, so I stood up in my chair to try and get a better angle. Then all of a sudden, the pitcher throws down his mitt and rushes one of the other team's players. He goes in with his arm cocked and throws a punch although it didn't land.  Then all of a sudden everyone else starts rushing in and a huge brawl happens. Now this was all exciting for the crowd of people that I was in, and people were crowding my space with their phones up trying to film the events. However, one guy had a beer in his hand and spilled it down my shirt! I was shocked and couldn't believe this had happened, so I turned around and told him I didn't appreciate that. He put down his phone and started saying how I was getting in his way and impeding what he was doing. I didn't appreciate being talked back to since I felt like I was the victim in this scenario. I start yelling and cussing at him and letting him know he is a giant waste and we start yelling back. A couple of people around us got between us and told us to cut it out. I told him I got beer spilled all over me and the person was definitely empathetic about that. I turned back towards the baseball field and noticed the fight was still going on. I grabbed a napkin someone had offered me and tried to wipe the beer off my body. The fight settled down and everyone seemed to go on their way. Feeling uncomfortable, I left the stadium and got in my car to go home. An eventful first baseball game ever!"
