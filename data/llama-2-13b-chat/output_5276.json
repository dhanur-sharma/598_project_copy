        "Summarize the following story in first person: I finally got time to make my journal entry for last weekend. I have been so busy, I haven't had time to write. Last weekend was particularly brutal. We had had three storms in a row and I had all the plowing and roof shoveling I could handle. The money was good, but it was exhausting work. On Sunday, I could not wait to get home because my dog, Scarlet, was new to the family and I knew she needed some company. I got home and Scarlet was so happy to see me that she was quivering. I took her out so she could do her business and that didn't take long. I sense she is not fond of the cold and snow. We got back inside and I got her some food and fresh water while I heated up a bowl of homemade chili, I had leftover. I was cold inside and out and just wanted to relax. The night was perfect to get a nice hot fire going in the fireplace. I piled in some dry kindling and a few seasoned pieces of ash and the fire was crackling and burning beautifully. I got up to go fetch my chili and when I came back into the room, I saw that Scarlet was hiding behind the chair shaking with a fearful look on her face. I set my bowl down and got down close to her to comfort her. I am not sure of her first year and what she went through before I rescued her from the shelter. I have seen occasional things that seemed to trigger some anxiety, but not like this. I think it may have been the sound of the fire and the intense warmth in the beginning. I picked her up like a baby and held her in my arms and sat on the couch. She was a bit uneasy, at first, but talking to her and taking occasional bites from my bowl of chili, she seemed to calm down and she looked up at me, with a knowing look in her eyes and I felt her tail wagging ever so slightly. I rubbed her belly with one hand and finished my chili with the other hand. As soon as I put my spoon in the empty bowl, she jumped up and licked a bit of chili off my chin, I had dribbled, and then didn't stop there. She licked my face all over. I had not seen her that happy since I walked through the door earlier. She, eventually, calmed down and curled up under my arm and we both drifted off to sleep."
