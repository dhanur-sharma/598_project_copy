        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was less a bar and more a fetish club,  really,  a plece where people with certain proclivities could meet each other.   There was alcohol,  but I didn't drink any,  because I do not drink.  I never have and I never will,  most likely.  I didn't start then.   I didn't really interact with people,  either.  I found a spot in the back,  I sat back.  I observed,   I waited.    The thing about just observing and being quiet is that people draw conclusions.  They think you're smart just because you don't say anything,  they think you're contemplative.   That might be true for me.  The important thing is that the image draws in people who like contemplative people,  and I like people who like contemplative people.   So,  I waited for someone to come to me.   And someone did.     She was attractive,  and I listen to her,  let her take the lead.  That's important,  too.   I take her ideas and expanded on them,  rather than taking control of the conversation.  I explored what she wanted to explore,   that's one of the reasons we hit it off.   To be honest,  I would have liked to get to know her better,  but that's not what she was interested in.    I prefer long term relationships,  she wanted something immediate and short term.   I followed her lead in that regard. When she asked me to escort her home,  I did so.  When she asked me inside,  I accepted.   It's not something that I'd like to do again,  but I enjoyed it at the time."
