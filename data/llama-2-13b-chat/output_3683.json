        "Summarize the following story in first person: With respect to my workforce, I resigned from a job I had two months ago. It's hard to do your job when you can't speak, and that's exactly what happened. I tried to improve my voice over the course of time but there was nothing I can do about it. Instead of trying to force my weight around, I resigned. I didn't want to, but I don't think I had much of a choice. As it turns out, there was significant blockage. This blockage took place in my saliva gland, and that caused me to lose my voice. I never knew such a thing was even possible. Then again, my scientific background isn't exactly sparkling. I just wanted to be there for everyone, but I needed to take care of myself. Most of my job required talking, so not being able to talk was going to cause issues. It took a while for me to admit a problem. But, I also didn't want to have the workforce lag behind. I think my coworkers understood. And maybe I'll come back."
