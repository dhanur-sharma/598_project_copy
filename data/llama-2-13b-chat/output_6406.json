        "Summarize the following story in first person: My Most Memorable Day of My Life! I found my other half, although it all seem wrong at first, but persistence and understanding can solve any problem. I was ordered a job at her office and I was to deliver the job to her. To be candid, I was not in the right emotional state to easily comprehend her simple order of bringing the files to her office. So, I just sat there waiting for her to come outside and sign the papers. Soon, I slept off. After some few hours, I was already dreaming of how possible I could solve my other problem that put me off in the first instance. Then, I felt a light tap on my left shoulder. I opened my eyes and it was already dark. Wow! I exclaimed. \"You must be very tired\", she said. \"Would you love some Chinese\". I was surprised at the kind gesture, but had to follow through by asking her to sign the paper first. She is just nice, I thought to myself while I was in bed later that night. Right now, she is my wife!"
