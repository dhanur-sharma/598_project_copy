So, I got a call that I can join the company. As a result, in the following week, I have to shift. My whole family is shifting with me and we are very much excited. This is the first time I have a prestige to work in such a big organization. I never had this kind of big working condition in my life. I was happy and my family were proud of me. They were very much happy and so was I. This is the new life that we are going to live. From here, we are heading towards the perfect start of my career and I was very much happy about it. I would get to stay in a place were I deserve to be and that made my family very much proud of myself. They now admire me for my work and respects me. They think that I am also a capable person who can do something in the life. They like me and talk to me nicely. My friends are also admiring me and they also are very much surprise to see me in such a great position."
