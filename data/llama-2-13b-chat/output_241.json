        "Summarize the following story in first person: A memorable time that comes to mind, is my sons birthday. He really wanted to go away for his day but we just didn't see it being financially possible. Somehow, my husband and I managed to get our funds in order and we were able to take the family to Disney. He was so excited. And to top it all off, he even got to eat at Cinderella's castle on the morning of his birthday. I am not sure who was more thrilled- him or I! We got to go to quite a few Disney parks and do some cool things. In Disney Springs we went on a hot hair balloon which was really neat! We also went to dinner and afterwards went on a vintage car ride in the water. It lasts about 20 minutes but it was quite unique to say the least. Some new things like Disney's new Toy Story land were a big hit. It was our first time there since they added all of that. The slinky dog ride was awesome and worth the VERY long wait.  I definitely won't forget this day and I know he won't either. Putting a smile on my child's face just means the world to me. I am so happy we were able to go. Not only for his birthday, but also to finally take a much needed family vacation. It's been quite awhile since we moved and I had to start working more hours. Although this day wasn't my birthday, it sure was a memorable day!"
