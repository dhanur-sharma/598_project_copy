        "Summarize the following story in first person: Four months ago, I was stuck in a dead-end job. My coworkers were nice, but boring. However, some of them had interpersonal communication problems, which made the situation at work tense. I didn't seem to be going very far in the company, but I wanted to change that. I went into my boss' office, and asked for a raise. She did not grant it to me, but she suggested ways in which I could work towards it, such as putting in extra hours in the office. I started doing this, and she started to take notice. She never gave me a promise of a raise, so it was somewhat risky for me to be spending extra time without a guaranteed reward. However, I pressed on. After landing two big new clients, she came to me and told me about her decision. She gave me not only the $1000 per year that I had requested, but an additional $2000 on top of that. She said that she appreciated the work that I had been putting in. She also said that my good work had caused HER boss to be impressed. She said that it was well-deserved. I went home that night feeling proud. And I held my head up high, knowing that my life was getting better, and that it was because of my hard work."
