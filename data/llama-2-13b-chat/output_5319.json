        "Summarize the following story in first person: In July, my childhood friend from Ireland came to visit us here in the US. She also brought her husband, who has visited several times, and her two kids who I had yet to meet. She also met my two sons for the first time. She stayed at my brother\u2019s house, but we all spent a lot of time together. We went to a baseball game, had a welcome party, went to a water park, and just had fun re-connecting again. In total, they stayed for two weeks and I took off work. I really wanted to spend quality time since I hadn\u2019t seen her in ten years. When I first saw her in my brother\u2019s yard, I broke into a huge grin. I gave her a huge hug and felt like we were kids again. It brought me back in time to our childhood summers together. We were carefree and stress free. We lived for her summer visits and did so many fun things. After we got older, we had jobs, kids, and responsibilities. Life has become harder but I felt like I was transported back in time when I saw her again. We laughed together like always. I hated to see her leave again."
