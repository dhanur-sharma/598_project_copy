        "Summarize the following story in first person: For the July 4th holiday last year, my friends and I planned a vacation to Key West, Florida. Since I had never been there before, I was excited to go. I had a a lot of great things about the local cuisine and all the activities that were going to take place for the July 4th weekend. Upon arrival and after checking into the hotel, we decided to take a trip to the each. The weather was perfect and the ocean was calm and beautiful. Being a fair-skinned person, I used a lot of sunscreen that day. I saw in the ocean and also played volleyball on the beach. We returned to our hotel and I looked in the mirror. As I was changing, I noticed that my shoulders and back were very red. I became quite alarmed because I thought I had applied enough sunscreen. However, when I went for a swim, the sunscreen came off and my skin was exposed to the sun. I believed that I had purchased a water-proof sunscreen. Over the next few days, I tried to stay out of the sun as I much as I could. When I was exposed to the sun, I made sure to apply an ample of sunscreen. In addition, I applied aloe vera to help with the pain and burning. On the last day of the trip, I woke up feeling ill and my sunburn was starting to blister. It was a very uncomfortable feeling and I had a hard time to sitting still. Upon arriving home, I decided to check into the local clinic. I met with the doctor who had informed that a had severe case of sun poisoning. Also, he advised me to come back if the conditions hadn't improved. This negative experience definitely impacted my life. I'm on high alert every time I go to the beach and exposed to the sun. Also, I'm hesitant to be out in the sun too long for fear of getting sun poisoning again. It's changed my outlook on life in that I realize one can never be too cautions when being exposed to the sun for long hours. Also, it taught me that I should have sought help earlier."
