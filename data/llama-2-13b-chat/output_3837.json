        "Summarize the following story in first person: Three months ago marks the most memorable yet terrifying time of my life. It was graduation day after a long road of college from Harvard University. I tried to view my graduation as a very happy time that would pave the road to many new adventures in the future. The only thing I wish I would have done differently, was mingling with other classmates. Its a shame I spent years around these people, and I can not tell you one thing about any of them(aside from my marching crew). After all, most of them did not seem very friendly or open to conversation. Even in college it was common to see cliques(which was something I thought ended after high school). On most days, I felt like an outsider and like I was merely existing while at Harvard. There was one thing that made me feel wholeness and like I belonged, and that was the marching band. I did not speak to many people while on the marching band crew, but we connected through our instruments and music. The members of my marching crew were very similar to me. Many of them did not talk a lot, and came to achieve greatness and do what they love just like me. I knew from the beginning that is where I was supposed to be. Although my days at Harvard are now a memory, I learned a lot about myself and the way of the world. Without my Harvard experience, I would not be half the person I am today."
