It was not like that and the opposite happened. With the arrival of good weather, the number of couples who decide to go through the altar increases. Every weekend, churches, courts and town halls see love for their halls parade. although not all stories end up as a fairy tale. Ending a relationship and literally breaking wedding invitations is not that uncommon. Gone are months of preparations and disbursement of money as a reservation of the place of the invitation. the flowers, the trip or the dress of the bride. What can the abandoned do? Apart from crying, since it is legally impossible to demand the fulfillment of the promise and force someone who does not want to marry, you can claim the money invested for the celebration. Getting married today is a luxury that many cannot assume. It hurt the money. my life. my family. everything."
