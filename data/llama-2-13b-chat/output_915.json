        "Summarize the following story in first person: A couple of months ago in May I took my 6 year old son fishing for the first time in his life. We woke up very early in the morning eating breakfast and brushing out teeth. After doing this we loaded up the car with our fishing gear and prepared to get out on the road. We drove for almost an hour until we arrived safely at our destination. We ended up going to the Clearwater Pier in Clearwater, FL. Clearwater pier is a huge bridge which used to connect Clearwater to St. Pete but was shut down and later re-purposed into a fishing pier. The morning started out by me teaching him a few safety precautions and showing him how to tie his lines and properly setup his fishing poles. We then began to proceed to fish, the morning started out slow but eventually we began catching fish. The first fish he managed to catch was a small Jack Crevalle. I was so proud of him in this moment no words can describe how it felt watching my son catch his first fish and being able to help him do this.  We kept fishing until lunch time catching a few fish in between. At lunch we prepared a pick-nick with the food supplies we had brought. Once we finished eating lunch we began fishing again catching multiple more fish each until we decided we had fished long enough. We packed up our gear which took around 20-30 minutes and got in the car. After getting in the car we decided to stop on the way home for hamburgers and ice cream. Once we arrived home we cleaned our fishing equipment properly and went inside to shower and relax."
