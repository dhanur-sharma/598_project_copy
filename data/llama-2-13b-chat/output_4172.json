        "Summarize the following story in first person: Two months ago I had the opportunity to go on vacation with my daughter, her husband, and my two grandkids. It was a great time. We took a road trip to California, and we went to Disneyland, Universal Studios Hollywood, and then topped it off with 10 days at the beach. We love going to California anyway, but it was so much more fun with those little grandkids. My oldest grandchild is my granddaughter, and she is five years old. Her little brother is three years old. It was so much fun to see them having fun at Disneyland, and then at Universal Studios. It was even more fun to spend 10 days with them in a condominium right on the beach. Each day we spent playing in the sun, sand, and ocean. In addition, they loved swimming in the pool. Even though the kids are very young, we took lots of pictures so they should remember throughout their lives. I know that my wife and I will treasure it for the rest of our lives. It was such a special time to spend with my daughter and her family. We definitely plan on doing it again in the future. Who knows, she might have another baby by then!"
