        "Summarize the following story in first person: In February this year, I recommitted my life to Jesus. It has been an astronomical change. I have never experienced such joy, peace, patience, and clarity. There was a time when I would use alcohol to fill this void in my soul. Or I always thought I needed to move, or find new friends, or perhaps a new marriage. There are even times I thought maybe if I had more kids I'd be happy. There was just something missing in my life. We found a church home years ago, but I would go on Sundays and be quite aloof to the teachings. But one day in February, I hit a emotional wall with my self satisfaction, judgment on myself, my parenting, my friendships, my health. That was when I prayed to the Lord to open my heart and my mind, and he did. I even could hear from the Holy Spirit occasionally. I no longer spend my days and nights with alcohol, I have been sober now for six months. When you explain this to someone who's not a Believer they probably think I'm crazy. But I do feel like every person in this world has a sense that there is something missing. They fill it with relationships, they fill it with alcohol, drugs,sex,clothes, cars,jobs, money. Whatever you're filling that void with it is meant to be filled with Christ. I truly believe that we are all made in Christ Image. And I will get debated sometimes of the big bang and evolution and all of that. However I always like to think, something can't come from nothing. So if there was a big bang, then God allowed that to happen. He created the first things to collide. There weren't just nothing that just blasted into nothing. plus, You can't tell me that every single thing on this planet just so happened to fall into a genetic DNA code. All I can say is my life changed and it is changed for the better in my marriage, my parenting, my health. And I give all of the credit to Christ."
