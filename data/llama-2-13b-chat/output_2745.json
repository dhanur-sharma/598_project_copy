        "Summarize the following story in first person: There was a young kitten in my neighbors yard that I rescued. My initial plan was to just  the kitten in my yard. But, My plans changed from that to talking it to a shelter to keeping it and taking care of it myself. Now, she has a name and a home for life. Because, we're cat folks Sophie and in our home. we already have a dog his name is  Simon and now, Simon started loving Sophie. we are allowed to pick up Sophie to our friends  are not. He stands there and barks until they put Sophie down follows. Sophie around the house and if the other animals get too rough. He gets between them and pushes them away. Sophie chews his face, his ears, his tail, his paws and he just has this big goofy grin. If you tell him where's Sophie? He runs and finds her. which is good smile because there's a lot of places for kitten to hide. In our house at times we keep joking that they match really. she's a nice cat. I really can't figure out. why someone would abandon this kitten. \"she is very well behaved\"."
