        "Summarize the following story in first person: I Have this friend who has a drinking problem. He is always drunk and drives drunk. He has only been stopped once for it but he keeps doing it. He has always been lucky and never crashed until three weeks ago. He had finally reached his rock bottom when he crashed in a ditch. He almost died and he realized that he needed change quick. His car was completly wrecked and there was no saving it. His jaw was now sewed closed because it was broken. His arm was also broken. He was trully at his rock bottom. When he was relesed from the hospital he went to get help for his problem. He Started to go to counseling and they recomended going to a program called AA. He has been going to AA for some time now. I have noticed a huge difference in how he acts and how he looks. He looks like he is going through a hard time but he looks heathier and he looks like he cares more. I have very high hopes for my friend to get better and I plan on helping him no matter what."
