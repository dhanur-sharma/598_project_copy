        "Summarize the following story in first person: It took a lot of effort on my part in order to acclimate my puppy to her new environment.  It wasn't so easy for her to feel comfortable the first few nights.  When she stayed with my sister, she had always slept in the bathroom off of her room.  My room didn't have a bathroom off of it.  Also, my sister has hardwood floors in her bedroom.  I have carpeted.  My thought it that my puppy liked the feel of the cold hardwood floors at night.  I'm under the impression that the carpet may have been slightly uncomfortable until my puppy got used to the temperature difference.  To test this theory, I bought a big piece of tile and put it at the foot of my bed.  Like the hardwood, the tile would stay cool overnight.  The very first night with the tile, it seemed like my puppy slept easier and didn't wake me up in the middle of the night.  My theory had been correct.  My puppy was to hot laying on the carpet because she already has long hair.  With the tile, it gave her a nice cool surface to relax on.  I'm not positive if this had anything to do with her eating and bathroom habbits though.  She ate very little and subsequently had to go the bathroom very little for the first week.  I'm not sure if she wasn't taking well to the environment change.  Potentially she had a specific routine of which she would go the bathroom at my sisters and had specific landmarks she associated with her location.  In order to combat this, I had my sister send over the kitty pool that she said my puppy loved to hop in and out of during the day.  I put this in the backyard to my house and in just two days, my puppy's mood seemed to elevate.  Not to mention, my puppy was getting much more exercise and was tuckered out from playing in the pool.  This instantly caused my puppy to eat and drink more.  All my problems seemed to be solved by simple observation and trial and error."
