        "Summarize the following story in first person: Back in June, my sixteen year old cat, Kisses, passed away. I got him from a local no-kill shelter when he was only 9 weeks old. It was an incredibly sad and emotional day for me. He was the perfect, orange tabby with a weak meow and a super skinny-face. I often thought he may have had some Siamese in him given his angular face. In any case, he hadn't been feeling well and had lost some weight. It was all of a sudden, too. It was over the course of about one-two weeks, where I could tell something was bothering him. I took Kisses to the veterinarian, and they did a check up and some x-rays. They came back to the room and let me know he had lung cancer, which appeared to be fairly advanced. I was in a state of shock. Kisses was always a strong, little cat and hadn't shown any signs of illness until the very end. I could tell he was slipping away and was in pain. I asked the vet if there were chemotherapy or radiation options. He looked at me with tears in his eyes (he has been my vet since the beginning) and told me it had spread. In other words, there wasn't much they could do for him. The part I dread about having a pet is in their last days. I opted to put him to sleep, so he wouldn't continue to be in pain. I will always miss my sweet Kisses, but I was so fortunate to have him."
