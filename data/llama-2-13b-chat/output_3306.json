        "Summarize the following story in first person: For a long time, my life has been a struggle. Not only my wife, but my son as well have been captured by the demons of alcohol. About 6 weeks ago, however, I had an important revelation. Heaven knows have tried to help both of them. I have taken them to rehabilitation centers. I have taken them to the doctor who have prescribed a variety of pills to help wean them from their alcoholic ways. But nothing worked for long. Meanwhile, the expenses mounted. Although I make a good salary. I could barely afford to put food on the table. So what happened 6 weeks ago? 6 weeks ago, I decided that I would stop by being a victim. I realized that nothing I could possibly do would help, either of these alkies. And I also realize that I had become afraid. Afraid of your own wife and son? It seems hard to believe. But it is oh so true."

My wife and son started to change. They started to see the light. They started to see that their drinking was causing their problems. They started to see that their drinking was destroying their lives. And they started to do something about it. I did not do anything. I did not force them to change. I did not try to change them. I simply stopped helping them. And that was enough.\n\n"
