        "Summarize the following story in first person: Two months ago I visited my good friend in Ormond Florida on the 4th of July. We use to date when we lived in the same city but now there is a a few hundred miles in between us. I've missed him so I wanted to take a quick weekend trip just to hang out. I ended up staying at his place on the beach which was amazing. Each morning we had breakfast at the local diner and then we would head to the beach to relax a bit. It was so nice just to be in his arms again and smell his cologne. The last night I was there was the best. He surprised me with dinner on the beach and the meal did not disappoint. He made fresh seafood pasta with Alfredo sauce, salad, and homemade rolls. We sipped on our favorite craft beer while we set at the little table he had set up. The most memorable part was the walk we took after supper along the shoreline. The tide was starting to come ashore and he stopped and gave me a gentle kiss. I was stunned when he pulled out a small box with a necklace inside. I was blown away by his kindness. I can't wait until we see each other again but I know it will be a few months.  I just hope we can both wait this distance out and one day be together. If it's meant to be then it will all work out."
