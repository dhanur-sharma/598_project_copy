        "Summarize the following story in first person: Never in my wildest dreams did I ever think that something so mind-blowing, heartwrenching, and beautiful could ever happen to me. I mean, I was present when my sister gave birth to my first nephew and I got to witness him come into this world... but never in my wildest dreams did I ever think I would have to deliver one of her children. When Miley Cyrus sang \"I came in like a wrecking ball\", I don't quite think she really knew what that meant, considering this sweet baby that I had delivered, had done in a physical sense. I woke up that morning and my sister and I were about to go shopping for some of her baby shower decorations when she tells me that she does not feel very well. We weren't expecting for the baby to come for another four weeks, so neither one of us detected that she was actually having contractions, especially considering they didn't really feel like contractions to her. She decides to lie down for a little while to see if maybe a little rest would help her feel better. Well, a few hours later she thought she needed to use the restroom so she got up, and she felt something really strange. By this time she calls me into her room and as I'm walking in she starts screaming that the baby's head is crowning already so I call 911 to get an ambulance on it's way, but the baby was coming way too quickly. I rush to gather some towels at this point because I just already knew that this baby was coming fast. I get my sister laid back on her bed and have her hold her legs up. At this point more of the baby's head is showing. The 911 operator is calmly telling me what to I need to do, but I'm still freaking out a good amount so I put the phone on speaker so that I can do exactly as they tell me to do. I counted with my sister and helped her with her breathing and pushes, and after three long pushes, out comes this baby. At first he's really quiet so I really start to freak out, but as I wrap him in the towel and rub his back, he let's out this strong wail. I pass him over to my sister and just about the time the 911 operator is telling me what else I need to do after this point, the paramedics knock on the door."
