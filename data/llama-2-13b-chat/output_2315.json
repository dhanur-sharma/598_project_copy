        "Summarize the following story in first person: For our 22nd anniversary, my husband was sneaky and had a whole day planned for us that I had no idea about.  He had surprised me with breakfast in bed and told me to get ready for a day on the water and also to pack another dressier outfit for later.  We always take our dog with us everywhere and he was even included in most of the day.  We started out adventure by enjoying the water in the boat and would stop off and swim here and there.  It was such a nice warm day and we just enjoyed the sun and the water.  We stopped off along a nice beachy bank area and had a wonderful picnic lunch.  After that we played along the shoreline with the dog, hunting for crawfish and playing ball and just splashing around in the water.  We continued to boat around a little more, looking and taking pictures of the birds and butterflies. We started heading in towards dinner time, and we stopped by a friends house so they could dog sit for us.  We got showered and changed and my husband and I went out for an early dinner since he said he still had one more surprise for me.  I tried to get him to tell me what the big surprise was, but he wouldn't let it slip!  The food was delicious and the company was wonderful but we were off for another adventure.  He surprised me with  hot air balloon ride at sunset, complete with champagne.  I had been wanting to go on a hot air balloon ride for years and this was just amazing.  After all that we picked up our dog and went home and snuggled on the couch, it was a wonderful day."
