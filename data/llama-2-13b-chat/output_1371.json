        "Summarize the following story in first person: My dad was diagnosed with stomach cancer in March 2019 and he passed way in May 2019. He was fairly healthy prior to the cancer and we were all shocked to know he was in the last stage of cancer. Life changed dramatically for us within 2 months and we could never imagine that he passed away so quickly. By the time the cancer was discovered, he was too weak and could not go through any treatment. We went through the roller coaster and finally lost the battle. Life was too short like I said. No one could tell precisely what would happen next second. All we could do is to focus on important thing and move on from bad things. Don't ever waste time on trivial thing and ruin your mood. It is not worth it! Just be positive and cherish what is good and important in your life. When the moment come, all will be passed. I wish I have spent more time to talk to my dad. Told him how much I loved him. However, it is too late now. There is no second chance in life. I will try to focus on big thing from now on and life as if it is the last day of my life. Be positive, be focused! We only have one life to live! We simply couldn't afford to waste time !"
