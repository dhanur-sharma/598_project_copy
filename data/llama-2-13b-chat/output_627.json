        "Summarize the following story in first person: This event is, quite simply, just a conversation I had with my wife about our future. It was a happy conversation that just happened randomly, about a month ago. We were plopped on our couch and just resting when my wife started a conversation about our future, about having our first baby. I was engaged. We started discussing how he or she would look like, who we want it to look like (LOL), how we will raise our child, and how fun (and simultaneously stressful) it would be to be a parent. It was a very meaningful and satisfying conversation. We normally don't have time available to just sit and talk like that. We live pretty busy lives. But that moment was really significant, because it meant something to us and what our future will be as husband and wife. We talked about how we have been married for over three years already, and we already enjoyed most of our time with just the two of us. It may be time for a new member to join in. We feel quite ready. I told her however if we can wait just a few more months before trying. I just want to have one more special anniversary to spend with her, then we can finally go for it. She agreed. It was a special time we shared having that conversation. It means a lot to us to share what we think openly, and be very loving and understanding of our thoughts and feelings. This event is something we would definitely look back at once we have our first kid."
