        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was in a musical duo that had decided to part ways. We wanted to fulfill our obligations though, so we performed at a large outdoor festival. I had been wondering what I'd do with my time, and I was also concerned my partner would have some direction forward. We played, but I guess due to nerves we rushed through our set with time to spare. Someone in the crowd asked my partner to play one of her solo songs. I was so happy her own work was appreciated. I got off stage as she played. I got into conversation with some people who are in another local band I like. Without knowing the duo was splitting, they suggested I \"try out\" for them. Really, a formality. They wanted me in. It was pretty remarkable that in a matter of minutes, both her direction forward and mine were made clear. I was relieved. I was also excited we could part with no bad feelings. Once she got off stage, I told her what happened. She was happy for me. I was happy for her."
