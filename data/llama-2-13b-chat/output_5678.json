        "Summarize the following story in first person: I got Azul, our Blue headed macaw to step up today!  Azul was hatched back in February and I have been hand feeding him since March when he was pulled from his nest box.  Having to feed him every 2 hours was hard and stressful, but after today that stress and hard work finally payed off!  Now that he has been on solid food since May, we've been trying to start his training to fly, but in order to do that, we need him to willingly step out of his enclosure and onto our hands.  We've been letting him learn to fly by letting him out of his enclosure and to just hang out in our prep kitchen while we work on cutting up fruits and vegetables for the the other birds.  Azul has been allowed to do whatever he wanted since about the end of May, but now that it's July, it is time for him to start his formal training.  The first thing I had to teach him was how to step onto my hand for a piece of food.  It was a struggle at first because he always wanted to play with our hand instead of offering a foot.  So when we'd place our hand out he would instead try to bite it to elicit a response from us (usually we'd would scratch his head so he didn't know why my hand was in front of his foot.)   For the first week of July I would place my hand by his perch and say \"Step up\" and if he moved towards my hand or lifted his foot, I would give him a piece.  Then when he got good at that, I would do the same thing, however instead for him to move towards my hand to reward him, I waited until he was fully placing a foot on my hand before he got his treat.  This past week I have been working daily with him and he has been progressing little by little.  Just on Monday he though about lifting the other foot off the perch.  Unfortunately I had to skip his training these past few days due to how busy we have been so Azul hasn't gotten any practice for the past three days.  I was expecting when I got into work today and got ready to train him that Azul would be back as square one after having those few days off.  However, instead of regressing in his training he actually progressed with out me!  When I asked him to \"Step up\" he did the cutest little hop and landed, both feet on my hand.  I was so excited that I had to remember not to jump or I might scare Azul.  It was such a moment to be held. After months of us hand-raising him and Azul getting some independence from us for a month I didn't realize how exciting and emotion filled getting over the first hurtle of training would be for me.  To hatch this gut go from being an egg to a bird who came on cue was such a joyous moment that I realized what this job was going to be like.  Leading up to this point, everyday was stressful and felt overbearing.  But getting to help these birds learn what is is to be a part of our program made me realize how much fun and fulfilling working with these babies can be.  Thank you Azul, because of you my outlook on work changed ever since today!"
