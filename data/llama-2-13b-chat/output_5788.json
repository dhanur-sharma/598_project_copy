        "Summarize the following story in first person: I had always wanted to go to England since I was a little girl. My husband knew that about me. So when our seventh anniversary rolled around, you can imagine my excitement when I opened my present. It was a plane ticket to England! We ended up leaving that night and we stayed for a whole week. We stayed at a cute bed n breakfast that made us truly feel at home. We did a couple of walking tours in places that we had really wanted to see. We saw Big Ben and Buckingham Palace. We took a picture with the guards. We tried to get them to laugh or crack a smile, but our attempts were futile. We also went to check out Stonehenge. That was a really cool experience. It reminds you just how small you are not just in a physical sense, but also in a sense of time. I would love to go back again and stay even longer. We had a lovely time, but I just wanted more! My husband and I definitely grew closer on this trip."
