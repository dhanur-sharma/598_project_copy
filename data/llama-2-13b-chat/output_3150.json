        "Summarize the following story in first person: A few years ago I was rather overweight. Some might have called me obese. I dreaded weighing myself for any reason but I needed to see a doctor since I had a problem with my gallbladder. The doctor said I needed surgery but couldn't get it. It wasn't painful at the time, but it steadily grew more painful. Somehow, that was my key. I broke down one night and decided to get my weight in check. Soon, I started going to the gym. It was pretty scary at first, but the regulars there only encouraged me. It was wonderful, and they helped me get into a weight loss routine. I started jogging with them as well as use the treadmills. I actually made some fitness friends along the way. Mind you, I still needed this minor surgery to be done. I still felt it from time to time. I lost over 100 pounds in the course of a year and a half, and I was able to go back to my doctor. They seemed really impressed that I took initiative and I was able to get the surgery."
