        "Summarize the following story in first person: Pokemon has been an important part of my life since I was a child. I've collected everything from plushes, coins, figurines, games and so on since I was 6. Bulbasaur is a Pokemon from Gen 1 and has been one of my favorites since I've played the Gen 1 games (Red, Green, Blue and Yellow). I'm even in a Bulbasaur fan club group on Facebook. You could say I'm a huge fan. When I heard rumors about a Bulbasaur Funko Pop being released, I knew I had to get in on the action. I remember getting notifications months earlier that the Bulbasaur 10 inch Funko was coming out. I was stoked and knew that I had to be there the day of release to get it if I wanted a chance of getting one since they were limited in quantity. I was excited and determined and counted down the days until it's release. I even told my mom about the plans to go and get it. Once released, I made sure to get up and get it the day of release since only a limited amount would be in each Target. I stopped at a couple of other stores in the mall area to run errands with my mom but as soon as we were done with that, I rushed to Target happily. As soon as I saw the Bulbasaur Funko, my face lit up I was so happy. I was also going to see Detective Pikachu with my brother later that day and decided to pick up posters and cards since they had those set out for free to promote the movie. Afterwards, I went to Gamestop to pick up a few other Pokemon related things such as my Ampharos plush and my Bulbasaur shirt."
