        "Summarize the following story in first person: This summer we went on a two month van camping trip across many states of the USA. We visited a lot of new places but the most memorable was visiting Laura Ingalls Wilder's childhood home. This was on a working farm. There were animals, including an adorable baby miniature horse. I was able to ride a covered wagon. I also visited a schoolhouse like the one she would have attended and taught in. A volunteer provided a lesson and challenged us with things children back then would have been required to know. We walked our dogs across fields and up to the edge of the crops. We could also see an old church in the distance across the field. There was a museum with a movie to watch as well. The best part was probably the reproductions of the sod house, the claim shack, and their first home on the prairie. Re-enactors demonstrated the ways of life in times past. We were able to camp right there on the farm. While camping, a neighbor family in a nearby camper had a birthday party for their little girl. They invited us to come over for ice cream cake. While we were all singing Happy Birthday around the picnic table, a lot of cows came right up to the fence to see what was going on. That was so funny."
