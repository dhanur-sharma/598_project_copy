        "Summarize the following story in first person: Five months ago, my husband had to have a surgery, and I was unemployed.  He had hurt himself at work, and as a result had to have a hernia operation.  Consequently, he was out of work for two weeks.  It was a really hard situation for us because my husband was the main source of income, and we had very little savings.  I was looking for jobs at the time, but they were hard to come by. I sent out countless resumes and applications but to no avail. I signed up for online job posting sites and looked for jobs on Craigslist.  Because of our financial situation, I grew very despondent and depressed, because every day our savings dwindled and we could barely afford to feed our kids. It was an even harder situation for us because we did not have any help from our families, as they lived far away.  It was very hard for me to get up in the mornings, and look for jobs because of the depression I was experiencing.  On top of everything else, my relationship with my husband started to deteriorate a little bit because he got a little depressed as well. Like it could not get any worse!  Our families helped a little financially, but they had their own lives to live.  Sometimes I wished that our families lived closer to us so that  they could help with the kids and give my husband and I a much needed break; unfortunately we had to make do.  Fortunately, we survived our difficulties; I had no doubt that we would, but it was hard going through it all the same. My husband went back to work and fortunately a couple months after he had his surgery I found a job that I love and am good at."
