        "Summarize the following story in first person: Over the past year, I have been planning out every detail to a Disney World vacation trip. I got the hotel room, the passes, other things to do in the area, I had saved money and did everything else I could think of. I had more than enough to get myself and my kids everything they wanted when we were there so no one would have a bad time at Disney! So six weeks ago when we were finally leaving for our vacation, I was feeling really great about the whole trip! Everything was planned out! What could have went wrong? Well, as you know when I think that something usually goes wrong. This time was no different. We had a couple of great days on vacation, however at night on the second day Abby got sick. We thought she ate some bad food and was just having a stomach ache. In the morning, she was puking and said that her sides and back and tummy hurt. I had no idea what to do, so my husband took her to a doctor there. I took the kids for Disney day three. Around lunch, my husband called to let me know that Abby had to go to the hospital because she had something wrong. I started to freak out and immediately told the kids we were going to see Abby. Abby somehow got gallstones and was having a gallbladder attack. I had no idea a child could have that! She ended up getting her gallbladder removed and for her, the vacation ended. My husband and I took turns sitting with her in the hotel but thankfully our room was near the park so at night we could all see the fireworks show. It made it worth it!"
