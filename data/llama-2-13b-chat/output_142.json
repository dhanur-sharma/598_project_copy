        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 2 months ago, one of our employees had a breakdown due to his family leaving. His family left him due to personal issues that they've been having. I was called because his neighbors thought that he had suicidal ideation due to his wife and kids leaving, and was advised that he had weapons in his house. At this time, I was very scared and it took me a moment before I realized what I needed to do. This man needs help immediately and that he can't be alone. So, I called the cops and responded to his home and found out that he wasn't suicidal but was just going through a lot. I asked him if he needs someone to be with him or if he wants to stay the night over in my place. He replied saying he just wants to be alone and that everyone deals with problems differently. He rest assured that he isn't going to hurt himself and that he is just looking forward to tomorrow. I took possession of his weapons to err on the side of caution and he didn't have any issue with it. The next day, he came and spoke to me and said that he has alcohol substance abuse, hence why his family left him. He self referred himself to the clinic. He then had to go inpatient into a rehab facility for 4 weeks. He finished the program 1 week early as he did great and actually came up with his own goals. His family came back home and they have been doing really well. He continues to attend Alcohol Anonymous meetings and continues to build his network of friends that he can rely on."
