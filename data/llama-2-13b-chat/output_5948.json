        "Summarize the following story in first person: My father-in-law is someone I'm very close to. When he was diagnosed with cancer, it was a dark cloud on our time. I didn't know how serious it was. But, if there is one positive, we are closer now than we have ever been. I didn't imagine myself connecting with this man as much as I have been. I still can't believe the good that was fostered from such a poor situation. I have become his health and mental counselor. I have supported him so much and I continue to grow closer to this man every single day. I could see where my partner gets their charm and compassion from. Cancer is no longer a death sentence. I choose not to associate with the what-ifs as much as I used to. There's no time for that. I just try to enjoy the here and now. I try to spend as much time with him as I can. I don't know what tomorrow could bring."
