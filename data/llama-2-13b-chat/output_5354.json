        "Summarize the following story in first person: Ever since I was 12 i loved motorcycles. i saved up money to buy a dirt bike since I wasnt old enough for a motorcycle. I rode that thing into the ground. When I finally turned 18 I bought my own bike and started going on rides with my dad. We travelled the US camping and going to biker bars across the states. We never had any trouble until recently with all the texting and driving. About 4 months ago we were on i80 and a car came barreling in off an exit and clipped my dad doing 75. The driver was on their phone the whole time and didnt even see him. My dad slid about 400 feet into the side of the road tossing and flipping. His bike was toast. There was blood everywhere and he for sure had a broken arm. When we got to the hospital it was much worse. His lung collapsed, 5 broken ribs, a broken collar bone and his arm was broken in 2 places. He was unconscious for 2 days and things werent looking too good. On the 3rd day he woke up and was in good spirits though a bit groggy. Since then he has been doing his rehab and up around the house. Im so thankful he made such an incredible recovery."
