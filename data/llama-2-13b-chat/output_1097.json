        "Summarize the following story in first person: There are some memorable days in my life and they remain ever green in my heart. My first day of school is such a day. It was the month of January 2003. I was then only six years old. My father proposed that i should be admitted into a school in class on the next day. I felt very excited i could not think of anything else. I was always thinking about the school, the teachers, as i watched on TV. I could not even sleep well that night. The next morning my mother woke me early in the morning, she wash me very well, comb my hair and dress me in new clothes. Then i had breakfast and started for school with my father. He took me to the nearest CFB primary school of our locality at 9:30 am. The school was not very far from our home, so we walk all the way, it took us about 30 minutes to get to the school. When i stepped into the school compound with my father i was somewhat afraid. I saw many student s on the school campus, some were playing some where talking to each other. Finding myself in a new environment my heart started to beat, at first my father took me to the headmaster's room and request him to admit me in one grade, i was nervous but his smiling face and and gentle eyes put me to ease. He asked me my name and i answered him. then he pointed me a letter chart and ask me to say some letters. I could say them all because my mother taught me how to say it at home. Then he became very pleased at me and admitted me to one grade, then he called Ms Fatema the one grade teacher to take me to class. When i entered the class all the students in the class where staring at me, i felt a bit nervous once again to see the new faces, i sat down and at my leisure period, all my classmate started playing in the field, i felt very lonely and was loitering here and there, then they invited me to join them, i started playing, i felt myself like a free bird flying in the open sky. My school ends at 12pm, my mother was at the gate to receive me. I leapt into her arms she kissed me caught me at her arms. That was how i spent my first day of school. I left the school with a new experience and a cheerful mind. I shall never forget that day as long as i live."
