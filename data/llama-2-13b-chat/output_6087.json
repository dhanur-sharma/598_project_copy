        "Summarize the following story in first person: I recently attended a family gathering in Michigan and got to spend time with many family members.  it was in Michigan, in the northern part of the state.  I drove through Canada and stayed in Niagara Falls on the way.  Niagara Falls was beautiful.  I visited Bird Kingdom and ate poutine.  It took a long time to go through customs though.  In Michigan I went to a winery with my girlfriend, aunt, uncle, mom, and sister and we talked about growing up and got nostalgic.  The next day was my cousin's wedding.  I remember him as a baby so it was strange to see him getting married.  He is all grown up now.  Everyone laughed and drank and had fun.  I got to talk to all my aunts and uncles.  One uncle I had not seen in 10 years so it was nice to catch up.  He has been going through a rough patch.  Seeing everyone made me remember how much I loved them all.  I wished we lived closer.  It was a very memorable event.  I hope there is another wedding or family reunion soon."
