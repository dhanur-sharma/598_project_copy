        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was in a strange part of my life. I didn't see what was coming to me. I was working a dead end job and was forced to live in an apartment in the shady part of town. This lasted about 6 months. Most of the time it was fine, but one day my landlord started acting strange. We had a deal where I was just paying him rent in cash. It was a little strange, but my choices were limited and him and I were both fine. He didn't appear to be a crackhead but I heard rumors among the complex. One day he just snapped. The first was when my rent was usually due. I went to his office like normal. When giving him the cash, he stood up, silent. Then he started berating and yelling at me. I was genuinely confused and started to leave. That's when he threw a punch at me. I was able to avoid it. I quickly started looking for another place to live and my cousin let me stay on his couch about a week while I was able to do that. I'm glad I got out of there."
