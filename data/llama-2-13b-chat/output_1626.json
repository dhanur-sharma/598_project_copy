        "Summarize the following story in first person: I had been thinking about volunteering with a local group that would do public art in our city. It was a few years ago that I first heard about them but thing distracted me from joining. I continued to do art and volunteer but never heard about the group again. Then one day, I decided to volunteer with a local group that would maintain the green spaces in my my neighborhood.  They would get grants and make landscapes more beautiful in the public spaces. They would also clean up the river. What I was most interested in was the art. I had recently participated in a public art project where an intersection was painted with a cartoon design of what animals were in the neighborhood. It was fun and I wanted to do it again. I then noticed an advertisement asking for volunteers for the green space group. I went to the meeting expecting to at least meet some neighbors and at best get to do some art in the public spaces. It was what I thought. They immediately asked if I wanted to be part of the murals that were being done in the neighborhood. I had found my place. I said yes and they said that I would be connected with the local group that I had heard about years ago. They would obtain grants from the city and state and use the money to create murals in the neighborhood by connecting with people who had something that we could paint on or paint on something owned by the city.  I was told to expect to have a meeting with the group very soon."
