        "Summarize the following story in first person: I can't believe what my friend is going through with her fiance. They have been together for 7 years and are finally planning their wedding. And I would have thought that after all that time together they would have already discussed what they want for a wedding and definitely how they each feel about kids, but apparently not! Just 5 weeks ago my friend's fiance told him that she wants an extravagant wedding, which he just doesn't have the money for or interest in. When he told her that the money could be better saved to spend on a home for them and their kids. She almost knocked him over when she said she didn't want any kids or a house for that matter. I mean it is her right to say no to kids and his right to say no to the expensive wedding but I really can't believe that the 2 of them have never discussed this in 7 years. Now our friends are divided among them in a fight over him saying no to the expensive wedding and her saying no to the kids. I am staying out of it and keep telling them both that they each have the right to say no to those things they don't want. The thing that needs to happen now is if they both feel so strongly about these things that they can't move forward together. My friend is mad at me because I won't just say he is right and she is wrong for telling him no to kids. As much as I understand his pain and disappointment, she absolutely has the right to say No if she doesn't want kids, especially since she would be carrying them. She is mad because \"every woman should have an over the top wedding\". It is his wedding too and he has the right to say no also. Especially if he is paying for it."
