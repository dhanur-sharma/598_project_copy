        "Summarize the following story in first person: Driving into Buffalo, New York having just traveled from Northern Vermont through Canada, I wasn't sure what to expect. I had trouble navigating the signs and kept getting distracted by notifications of wineries coming up on the turnpike. I was headed to Niagara Falls, something I have always wanted to see, but the reason for me going there was complicated. My boyfriend and I had just broken up, he was a brutal dude, I still had fresh bruises and wanted to keep moving while I had the courage - and I currently had all of my belongings in my car. I wasn't sure where I would end up, but couch-surfing a friends place in upstate NY I saw a ridiculous ad on TV for the falls so decided to go. It wasn't a well-thought out or wise decision, but Niagara here I come. Eventually I cut back down from the km loving Canadians to western NY and found the right exit and crossed something called the Rainbow Bridge? (Also distracting!) Border patrol asked me a bunch of questions I couldn't answer (how long will you be here? why are you here?) - but they let me cross anyway. I drove into town, used some of my (not considerable) savings and bought the cheapest room with an all-you-can eat buffet I could find. So about $30 (Canadian). I checked in and then decided to try and find the falls. It was late at night now and walking in a new town full of lights and tourists was disorienting. I followed the mist. And found it. And it was spectacular.  So much water, a louder roar than you would expect and....spectacular. The water was calling to me. Telling me what to do. I had a new direction now."
