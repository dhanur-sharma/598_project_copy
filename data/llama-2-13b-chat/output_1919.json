        "Summarize the following story in first person: A few weeks ago I went to a bachelorette party for a good friend. We all went out prior and did hair and nails, got dressed up and hit the town with tons of party favors in tow. We went to a place that we all know well where we ordered our first round of drinks. After a few rounds, one of my friends brought us another round. It was around our fifth or so and things were really getting loosened up. As I was drinking my drink and slurrping what was left at the bottom of the glass, I saw something pink. I played with it with my straw thinking it was a chunk of fruit or something. That's when I realized it was a finger nail!! i was so grossed out, I dropped the glass and it broke on the floor. It was super embarrassing because it caused a little scene. The bouncer came by and said I had enough to drink. I tried to tell him there was a nail in my glass, but he wasn't believing me since our bachelorette group was pretty loud at this point. When I dropped the glass, the nail was no where to be found, so I had no evidence. I was cut off from drinks and our group was under scrutiny after that. I didnt ruin the party, but it sure put a damper in things! We will all remember this night forever. Eventually, we went to another place, but it wasnt as fun as the first."
