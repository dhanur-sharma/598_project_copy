        "Summarize the following story in first person: My friend came with his wife that i have never met and she was fairly decent at introducing herself and being nice to me and me and my family and hanging out with us. But when me and my friend started a a barb q in the backyard and bought a few beers i could see the bitter side of her come out. She started to first whisper to him then i saw them go into the garage i had in the back and starting arguing. I did not want to be intrusive so i just backed off but when he got back to sit down i saw something was bothering him so i asked him whats wrong and he said not to worry about it. We then sat down and had a few more drinks then i saw it happening again and at this time it was a little louder than before which i tried to ignore but i could not at this time so i had to go in between them and asked them to calm down. What really went on that he did not want to tell me is that he was an alcoholic and he was keeping it from me and when he drank he could not stop. That is why his wife was getting mad at him for drinking and she knew that he could get out of control if he had too many. She was actually telling him to stop and not to go any further and embarrasses her. I felt like i knew my friend but in reality a lot of things have changed over the years. I can now see that people change over time and no one ever remains the same especially child hood friends. Sometimes in life people go thru things that affect them greatly, i was not there from when he got married up to that point so i could not really tell what was going on. I also did not know that he drank so much and it was affecting his married life. I felt that i knew my friend, as a younger person he did not have any addiction, he was into sports and loved spending time with his family , that is what i have known him for mostly . I do not know where in life he went wrong or what happened. After we were done that night after the BBQ i had a little talk with him and asked him if he needed anything from me or if he ever needed anything in life no matter what it was even if it was emotional support i would always be there for him and never forget how we were when we were little kids and growing up how things should be when you grow older although not the same. He said yea he might be in touch but this is just something he has to figure out on his own and that it has nothing to do with anyone or anything. He said that his addiction is somewhat uncontrollable due his it running in his genes."
