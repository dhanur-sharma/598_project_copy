        "Summarize the following story in first person: I always liked driving around. Sometimes, I can drive for two hours and feel good about it. It's nice to quietly explore the scenic highways. Recently, I thought, \"I have never been to Canada before. Should I visit Canada one week?\" Therefore, I planned a trip driving across Canada to Niagara Falls. As I drove to Niagara Falls, the excitement built the more I drove. I stopped to eat, get gas, and sleep. Otherwise, I was on my way to Niagara Falls with no other destination in mind. After a number of hours of driving, I arrived at Niagara Falls. Niagara was an interesting place to visit. As I looked at the Falls themselves, I remember thinking to myself, \"That is a lot of water.\" I can understand why this is such a tourist destination. The amount of water it takes to run these falls is substantial. I'm not sure a lake I live nearby has as much water, and it's considered to be a huge lake. The people here were very nice, and I got to talk to a few of them. Locals tell me that nothing compares to Niagara Falls. I agree with them."
