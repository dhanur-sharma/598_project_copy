        "Summarize the following story in first person: The event I am writing about is my recent job search.  I started to look for a new job after co-worker left and make my job much more stressful.  It was not an easy decision to have a job search when I worked in the same place for close to 12 years.  I started out with aggregate job posting site Indeed.  I found out with their email notification it is very helpful for a job seeker.  This job searching is not an easy process to customize my cover letter and resume for individual job.  I applied over 10 jobs and have 1 phone interview and another with an in-person interview in this 2 months period.  I went for the in-person interview job and find out I have experiences with the position.  I was excited to learn that I got one of the job with a much higher pay than what I am earning.  I also will have less stress on certain part of the job compared to what I am working as.  I will be starting the new job in about a week.  I hope things will be alright.  I feel anxious and excited at the same time.  It is partly because I was in the same position for close to 12 years in the same company and now I will have to adjust to a new routine.  Some of my coworkers where I am working in now are very sad about my leaving."
