        "Summarize the following story in first person: I once worked in a steel company but after some months, I was fired. On one fateful morning, I had a call from a friend who was a former coworker and he told me about a job opportunity. I was so glad on hearing this. However, the company was over 3,000 miles away. I told him I'll get back to him as I need to take my time in considering it due to the distance. At last, I made up my mind and I called to inform him about my decision. He told me the interview is in some weeks time and he gave me some hints on the questions they are going to ask to prepare ahead for the interview. I appreciated him and he promised to reach out to me whenever he heard of anything. I started studying very hard for the interview and praying as well. Finally, the day of the interview came and I made my way to the company. On getting there, I was the next person to be called and I rushed in. Fortunately, I was offered the job after interviewing with the company and I was also allowed to work remotely. I work so hard for the company in other to stand a good reputation and for my promotion. though it wasn't easy to travel for a very far distance, but the salary worth it. The company where i was fired had about this and were willing to call me back to resume but i couldn't because the company i work for now enjoying my staying."
