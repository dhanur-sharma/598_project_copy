        "Summarize the following story in first person: This event happened on August 19th of 2019. My mother had a heart attack before she was supposed to go in for surgery. She was having a laprascopic hysterectomy performed because the doctor found cancerous cells in her ovary. As they were prepping her for surgery, something in the anesthesia caused her heart to stop beating. The doctors and nurses had to restart her heart. I was then told be the doctor what had happened and that she was going to be transferred to another hospital that could better take care of a patient with heart problems. I was distraught and in a state of panic. My mother is my best friend and I couldn't grasp onto the possibility of me losing her. I have multiple anxiety disorders and they all went into full effect. I had a full blown panic attack on the way to the other hospital. I was trying to call my aunt to have her meet me at the other hospital and the call wasn't going through. I actually sat in my car for a few minutes trying to calm myself down knowing that I would have to talk to doctors and nurses. I don't know how but I got myself together enough to be able to be a functioning person. I met the doctors who were taking over her care and they were very helpful. She didn't have any real lasting damage and some of the nurses said that this can happen sometimes with giving anesthesia. We are now rescheduling her hysterectomy surgery for a later date and she is now somewhat normal. I still remember the utter feeling of helplessness and despair at just the thought of losing my mother and my best friend forever. I am still dealing with the emotional fallout from this and would like to feel normal again."
