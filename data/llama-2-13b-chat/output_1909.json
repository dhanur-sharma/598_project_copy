        "Summarize the following story in first person: I am still highly motivated to complete my weight loss goal due to the Woman's World magazine coverage. Being featured in the magazine was both an honor and a huge accomplishment. It makes me proud to know that so many others were inspired by my story. Since appearing in Woman's World, I have been approached by others to do similar stories. I now have the opportunity to be featured in First for Women. The editors contacted me for a brief screening. The screening was to see if I was still making progress on my goal. The screening also was for determining the likelihood of me reaching my goal and not abandoning the process. Because of this new opportunity, I have re-dedicated myself to my goal and am inspired to finish what I started. What is most surprising to me is that I was able to lose the weight without having weight loss surgery. Unfortunately, when I began the journey, my health was bad and I had many health issues related to obesity. First of all, I had a poor metabolic system and a sluggish thyroid. I was told that it would be nearly impossible to lose the amount of weight that I needed without having surgery. I could not have surgery because being being put to sleep was not an option. I suffered from congestive heart failure and was nearly 400 pounds. Surprisingly, I was able to lose nearly half of my body weight. I was also able to reverse the effects of obesity and am now highly active and my heart function has returned to normal."
