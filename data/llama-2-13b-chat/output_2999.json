        "Summarize the following story in first person: I hadn't talked to my ex boyfriend in many years but we recently had gotten back in touch when he added me on Facebook. He didn't post often, but one day I was shocked to see a long post from him saying that he only had a few weeks to live. He had a heart condition due to his past drug abuse, and since he had an extremely low chance of survival, no doctor wanted to perform the surgery on him. I contacted him and though there was little I could do, I recommended him some good hospitals with heart surgeons who had worked miracles on my grandparents. I also sent him some healing oil blessed by Padre Pio, which he said he never got. Not long after the surgery, I spoke with him to ask how the surgery went. He said it went well but that he still didn't think he was going to make it. He died a few months later. I felt shocked when I heard the news. I also felt very sad. It was a bit of a \"thing\" to think about, that the last time I spoke to him, he told me he felt he wasn't going to make it. And he didn't make it. He was right. I also feel like I should have done something to help him. or at least give him comfort. But in reality, what could I do? I couldn't cure his ailment.  I felt relieved, and convinced myself that he was going to be fine because he had lived through the operation. This was selfish of me. I wanted the relief of not having to worry about it anymore. So in my mind I made it over and done with. I was so wrong."
