        "Summarize the following story in first person: 2019 will always be home to one of my favorite days. It all happened five weeks ago. Autumn was gradually turning into winter, and we were looking for something fun to do, as a family. But this was a special occasion, because my mom was in town, and I hadn't seen her in 2 years. Her health had been poor as of late, but new physical therapy brought life back into her body movement and spirit. So, she was looking to visit and see her family. She flew in the day before, and brought love and excitement into the occasion. My kids, ever excited to see grandma, and find something fun to do, began listing all their ideas. Jack, my son, screamed, \"beach,' and Joan, my daughter, yelled, \"fair!\" We all agreed, based on weather, that the fair was the best idea, so, we packed up the car, and trekked out into town, where the fair was located. Typically, Im not too keen on fairs; its always so noisy, sometimes dirty, and for some reason I always get the cold/flu there. Nonetheless, my opinion was not important, because this was about family and magic, so we got our tickets at the booth, and began perusing all the attractions. The kids went on the Whirly Wheel first, and my wife tried the Cup Shooting (she won a giant penguin for my daughter). It was during this time that I was able to take a few minutes to chat with my mom face to face; it was nice to see her, see her up and moving. It was at this moment my mom told me she hadn't been on a carousel in 60 years, since she was a child. So we got on together, she sat on a pink horse, and I stood beside her for physical support. The music began and we began to whirl, the light in her eyes was palpable. It was life a flashback to her childhood; it was truly a magical moment. Afterwards, we joined together again, and went off the concession stand. The kids had never had fried dough, so we got three big plates full, and indulged. They filled their mouths as they listened to the sights and sounds around them.  \"This place is magical, Dad,\" Joan yelled. \"Ya! Im glad we didnt go to the beach!\" Fireworks erupted overhead. For me, this was a magical moment, and capped off a magical day with my mom, kids, and wife."
