        "Summarize the following story in first person: I took a trip for work that included a close friend. The trip was for a conference, but then we chose to stay over a couple days, and she brought her daughter along for the trip as well. Overall, the trip went ok, but there were reminders of why our friendship was strained. While I do still care about her, and I believe she still cares about me, the trip cemented the idea that we're basically at a point of the friendship ending. While spending time together was nice, there was an air of separation , and almost a wall between us. It's easy to understand why. The fact that we attempted a romantic relationship that failed and tried to keep everything normal worked a while, but we can't keep that up forever. So we're now in a situation where we're close but divided, being friends for 15 years can't just be cut off, but its almost like it stops now, and we just get to share the past. We got to experience Washington DC together, but I don't think It will ever be \"our\" trip, but rather a trip we both went on. I'll at least have the memories of the museums and memorials for myself. In terms of things that happened, we had many periods of silence while even being in the same room, and at times it seems she didn't want to be around me. As I could, I would go do my own thing so she wasn't getting upset, but it was painful to do so. Realizing you're not wanted isn't a fun experience. There was never a situation where she said I needed to go away, but it was made uncomfortable by the way she acted. It's hopefully something that will heal with time, but I don't know that it will. It's causing me to look into new jobs so that I can remove myself from the situation."
