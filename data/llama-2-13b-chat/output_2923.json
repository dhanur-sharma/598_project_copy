I had planned to wear a particular outfits for this event just to standout.But unfortunately ,my dry-cleaner almost ruined it and that would have got me upset really. But i was happy at the end of the day one of my friend came trough for me by making sure the outfit made it to me at the last minute .Just when i had lose hope completely. As if that was not enough. Just when we thought it was over, we planned to have some time out as buddies who just graduated. we went partying at a club downtown. It was fun all night. The music was loud , there were enough drinks to go round. The girls were dancing and happy. The guys were having good laughs and drinks. There were alcohol for everyone. we really had mad fun all this while till when suddenly. One of us started misbehaving and convulsing. He was rushed by the guys for help. I think he had too much to drink not considering his health. One of us attended to him by giving him CPR . after sometime , he gain consciousness . By this time we took him ot of the club. And planning to take him to the hospital but he refused going . He only wants to go home as he was hungover . We left the party and headed to his apartment some miles away from the club. When we go to his apartment, He had his shower and was calm. He made sure he threw-up the alcohol intake from the party. He was calm afterwards. Daniel decided to stay with him to keep eye on him. We left his place to our various homes after all the party was over. I left for my place and when i got home ,dinner was set. Had dinner with my family. I checked on my buddy from the club earlier and my friend [Daniel] told me he was okay."
