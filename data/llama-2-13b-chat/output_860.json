        "Summarize the following story in first person: So with coffee (made to perfection I might add) in hand and my favorite comfy sweater on I start to peruse the internet. It has been a while since I had a computer, and since I didn't have one, it made no sense to have an internet connection. I had thousands of emails to catch up on and friends to \"friend\" on Facebook.  When I am depressed, I have no desire to see what friends are doing especially if something wonderful is happening in their lives like getting married. Knowing that marriage is so far for me, I can not relate. But if I were to be totally honest, I am jealous. Jealous that they, seemingly, have normal lives. Some days I can hardly get our of bed because of the depression. My boyfriend has been so patient with me. He is a great friend and is always there for me when I can't be there for myself. Surprisingly, we met at Barnes and Noble. About 6 months ago, I was in the self-help section and he was looking for a book for his graduate studies in psychology. I did not notice him at first but smelled cigarettes and followed my nose to a thin man with a beard. I gave him on of those once overs, starting at the flash of red hair (oh how I love gingers). The beard was slightly more brown than his hair and his eyes were bright blue wearing tortoise shell Raybans. Moving down I noticed he was quite muscular despite his smallish stature. I stand 5 feet on a good day and he was a few feet taller. Wearing a white V-neck and perfectly fitted Levis, he somehow intrigued me. I moved a little closer to see if I could detect, through the cigarette smell, the cologne he was wearing. Yep, there is was, Aqua de Gio. My favorite and one that totally turns me on. I am getting slightly turned on now as I am writing this. What surprised me most was when he noticed me and asked me how my day was going. I blushed a little and said \"Great, now\". He asked me to have coffee with him in the Starbucks at the book store and as they say...\"the rest is history\"."
