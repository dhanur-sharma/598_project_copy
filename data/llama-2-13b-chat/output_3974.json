        "Summarize the following story in first person: It's been almost two years since my husband and I first started trying for our first child. We were so overcome with joy when the tests came back positive and Dr. Nguyen confirmed that I was pregnant. But God decided that He needed to take my little angel back with Him. It's been two weeks since the miscarriage, and I am still a wreck over the loss of my baby. I had to ask my boss for some time off of work to process the loss. I couldn't concentrate and just broke down when anything could even be slightly related to a baby. Thankfully, she was kind enough to allow me the time off. She even had flowers sent to my home. My boss isn't the only one that has been kind. Mom and dad drove down to take care of the house. Dad's been fixing up some parts of the house that we were being renovated when we were still expecting a baby. Mom has been cooking meals for us and cleaning up the house. I am so thankful to have them here. Growing up, mom and dad always knew how to comfort me and make me smile. My friend Janine organized a lady's night out with the other girlfriends. We got manicures and pedicures. I had my hair done. Janine paid for everything for me. It's been nice to get pampered and to pretend like things are normal for once. I'm so thankful for the love and support everyone has shared with me."
