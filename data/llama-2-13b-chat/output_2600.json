        "Summarize the following story in first person: About a month ago, my husband, who was deported to Eastern Europe, accidentally sent me a video through messenger of himself out on a date with a woman who is not me. When confronted about the video, he promptly removed it and tried to tell me that I was exaggerating the contents. Unfortunately, it was very clear that the two were intimate with each other. I found this to be heartbreaking because I have spent tens of thousands of dollars and flown back and forth from the States to Europe on multiple occasions to bring myself and our son to him over the last year. During a phase in our marriage where I thought that there was no obstacle we could not overcome, I was absolutely blindsided by this happening. Moreover, to deal with ICE, immigration court, physical deportation, flying across the world with a toddler in tow, the expense of maintaining two households, only to have my marriage end over something so much ridiculous, is highly frustrating on many different levels. The aftermath of this situation has been constant bickering, anxiety, and loss of sleep. Furthermore, I have come to realize that this man is not the man I thought he was. The financial cost has been an approximate loss of $3500 since I had already secured our return tickets. Psychologically, I am frustrated because I have had to deal with immigration laws while securing permanent residency overseas, which will obviously no longer be happening. I feel sad for our son more than anything else. Because our son is so young, it will be many years before he sees his father again, as I will not feel comfortable flying him alone for such a long flight. This has never happened to me before, I would never have expected this from my husband and it is devastating to know I have wasted so much time on a relationship that could end so abruptly. I actually found this to be more distressing than him being deported in the first place. I have contemplated working through the infidelity, but came to the conclusion that it is not the financially intelligent move to make when I have a young child to raise. This is definitely the most striking and emotionally upsetting thing that has happened to me in quite some time."
