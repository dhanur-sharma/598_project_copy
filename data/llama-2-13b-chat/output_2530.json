        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 3 months ago something strange happened.  I woke up one morning and everything seemed normal, but it wasn't! The night before one of my eyes had been red but it didn't hurt. I took my contacts out of my eyes and decided to sleep without them that night. Everything was fine with my eye in the morning so I put the contacts back in. My eye was no longer red. I went about my morning as I usually do when all the sudden I saw red gushing down before my eye. Right in front of me, like someone had put a red lava lamp in front of me, I saw what looked like blood, but it wasn't there when I waved my hand in front of my eye. I thought there was something in my hair but there was nothing. I realized there was something going on with my eye. It was freaking me out because not only had nothing like that ever happened to me before I also had never heard of anything like that happening to anyone else! I drove myself to the eye doctor unbelievably with my eye like that. The eye doctor sent me to a retina specialist. What happened 3 days later was that I had to get eye surgery because I had a hemorraged blood vessel in my eye. I remembered about 3 nights before that I had accidentally hit myself in the eye with my hand. It hurt for awhile but then I had forgotten all about it. After the surgery I still saw little blood vessel floaters for a couple of weeks but am happy to say my eye got back to normal. That was a really scary situation and I do not ever want to go through that again!"
