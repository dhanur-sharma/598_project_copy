        "Summarize the following story in first person: Today I quit my job in order to retire.  I was not entirely happy about it, but it was time.  I wish I had left a better feeling at work with Stephanie, but aside from that, it was basically a good experience.  Tim said \"Good luck, Mike\" when I cleaned out my desk.  I gave Chris my tissues and a fistful of red pens.  Since Chris has severe allergies, this small gift was appreciated.  I gave Rachael an unfinished buyback, but luckily she appreciated the humor.  I loaded up Smiley, my Mexican sugar skull, and Jules, my turtle.  I put the box in the car and took a deep breath.  The weather was nice and sunny.  I did feel a sense of relief as I drove away.  I would never have to go there again!  There were money worries, of course.  But I have plenty saved.  Also, Kathy is still working, so that will help.  And I can devote myself to the kids."
