I knew this day was coming. She left me alone in a lonely house. My heart raced as she walk out the door. I ran to her and wished I could beg her to stay but I know life has to go on. I felt very uncomfortable as I hugged her goodbye. I'll have to admit. I did get sick and I was very cold. I couldn't get out of the funk I was in. Today though, I will try something new and get out of bed to enjoy my day. I lept out of bed, put the cold water on my face. I ate a half piece of bread for breakfast. All in all I think i'm gonna have a good day."
