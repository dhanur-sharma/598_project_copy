        "Summarize the following story in first person: I had the most uplifting experience a month ago.  I was approached by the pastor at my church in regards to teaching Vacation Bible School. I have to say I was shocked at the thought of teaching children about the Bible. It is a subject that I struggle to understand myself.  I voiced this concern to my pastor. He told me that is the reason he wanted me to take the role of the teacher. His believed this experience would help me understand the teachings of the Bible and at the same time benefit the children. After careful consideration, I agreed to teach Vacation Bible School. I must say this endeavor turned out to be one of the best decisions I have ever made. I was assigned to a class of 7-9 year-olds. The children in this age group were inquisitive and full of wonder. I immersed myself fully into each lesson. The decision that I made to undertake this challenge was one of the best I have ever made. I learned more about the Bible during that week than I had learned in my entire life. The children were responsible for opening my mind up to all the things that were confusing to me concerning the teachings of the Bible.  The children had an awareness that I hadn't before this week of teaching. They graciously shared their stories and opinions on the lessons I was teaching. That was one of the best weeks in my life. I am so glad that I participated in the event. My pastor was right about this aiding in my understanding of the teachings of the Bible. During that week of Vacation Bible School, many of the questions that were always pulling at my mind were answered by innocent children. The memory of that week will forever be in my heart."
