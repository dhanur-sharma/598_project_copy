It had fables of Ancient Persia passed down orally through the generations. These stories were very unique and rich. There was a tell about a boy. He played with his dog everyday. He threw a ball down the road one day. A cart was going to hit the dog but it missed. This taught me to look around for my surroundings. I was sorry for the dog. He was scared in the story. I'm glad that he didn't die. This tell should be taught to everybody at a young age. It teaches them to be careful and thankful about their mortal life."
