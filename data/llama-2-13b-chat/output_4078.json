        "Summarize the following story in first person: Several months ago, for an international vacation, I decided to travel to France for ten days. I traveled there with my brother and a close friend and we spent the whole time relishing the change in scenery and culture. While staying there, I got in touch with a friend of mine on social media that had been my best friend throughout my entire youth. Through our back-and-forth chats, I discovered that she was visiting her sister in a small city rather near where we were staying. Immediately, we were both enthused about the possibility of reconnecting and didn't want to miss such a surprising opportunity. The vacation was nearing its end, but I decided to extend my stay there by five days since I didn't need to return to work for another week and I could spare the expenses. My brother and friend returned home on a flight the next day. The following day, we decided to meet at a local cafe. The cafe was a beautiful little countryside shop that was surrounded by some stunning scenery. I arrived first, but only had to wait for five minutes or so. We picked a table outside, which made for a very pleasant experience due to the lovely weather and tranquility. Somehow, despite having hardly spoken for eight years aside from a message or two, we reconnected so easily. Our conversation wasn't the least bit awkward or stilted even at the beginning and we fell back into a sort of easygoing, lighthearted rhythm remarkably naturally. After a small lunch, we spent the rest of the day traveling by train through the countryside. We talked and laughed and shared numerous stories about our lives over the years. Nothing felt difficult to talk about and the depth of our friendship seemed to have never left, as though it would be able to survive anything. We said goodbye to each other that night, but met up again two days afterward and spent the majority of my remaining time there together. Aside from the reformation of a wonderful friendship, the whole experience was one of the most transformative of my life. It reawakened my creativity and love of life to an extent that few other things ever had. It also emphasized the importance of maintaining my relationships throughout life. We parted in great spirits and have kept in contact regularly ever since."
