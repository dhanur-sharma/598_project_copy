        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was recently at an outdoor concert  with my daughter who is now 35 years old with children of her own.  It was an  event up near where she lives which is approximately 60 miles from where i live and where she grew up.   We all set up on the grass to watch one of my favorite bands, The Beach Boys. it was myself, my daughter, her husband and her three kids.   I have never seen them in person and they were amazing of course.  After about an hour i had to use the ladies room.  Upon returning, i saw my daughter talking to a guy who i just thought was striking up conversation about the concert.  Imagine my surprise, when i walked over and he introduced himself as Richard who i grew up with in my old neighborhood.  .  While i did remember his name, i did not recognize him.  i remember he lived across the street from me and that we went to the same school  When we were really young he had a crush on me but as we got older we had different friends.  He moved away when we were both sixteen.  The strange part comes next in how he began talking to my daughter.  He  said  was walking by my daughter and her family and immediately realized that she looked like someone he had known growing up (me).  He said he felt sort of uncomfortable approaching her but the resemblance was so uncanny he just had to.  He then asked if her mothers name was Debbie  and if she lived on the street where i grew up as a kid.   Of course she said yes but also added that i was at the concert and just in the ladies room.  We reminisced for a while but the most amazing thing was how much she must look like me to be able to recognize her as my daughter after all these years!  Also i find it amazing for anyone to remember me all those years, especially since i didn't  remember them (by looks)."
