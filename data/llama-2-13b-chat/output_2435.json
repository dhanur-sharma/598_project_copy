        "Summarize the following story in first person: This day I was awoken by my text notifications going off like crazy, it was my downstairs neighbor calling for help to get to the pharmacy for her prescription. She was in so much pain but wouldn't allow us to pick up the prescription for her.  When we were leaving she actually had to stop and take a break to get to the car. Her breathing was taxing and her color of her skin was all off.  You could tell something was really wrong but she was so hesitant about telling us about her condition. I know she believed if she kept it inside it wouldn't effect anything on the outside. We could totally see she was in pain and lots of suffering.  While we were at the pharmacy counter the pharmacist asked if she needed any explanation about her meds, and she replied no.  They asked her for the identification and then proceeded to tell her that the prescription was morphine and what her dosage was.  I acted as if it was no big deal, but just about then I new something was really wrong.  She then pulled me aside and told me her predicament of her diagnosis,  and then told me it was metastatic pancreatic cancer.   I was destroying her liver, kidneys and stomach.  The next day we took her to the hospital, and stayed with her as long as we could, she had no one except us. Her family was all gone, she had a daughter that had no idea that her mother was so sick, she had absolutely no clue, but that is how her mom wanted it.  She was diagnosed a week ago, and today, less than a week later, she is gone."
