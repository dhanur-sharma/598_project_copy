        "Summarize the following story in first person: We purchased our first house on March 5th, 2019.  When we finally got the keys we couldn't believe that we have accomplished our dream of being homeowners.   It was very exciting because we had dreamed about owning our first house for a while. We ran inside the house and looked at every empty room and we imagined our furniture it. Little by little we began to make it our home and we began to create memories.  The process in buying our house was very stressful but in the end it was worth it. We are also still adjusting to our new city and neighborhood. My son will start a new school soon.  We are still adjusting to being new homeowners. We were very excited to have a backyard and to have a garage.  We had always dreamed about having summer family gatherings. We are looking forward to having summer BBQ s soon. So far we are enjoying every moment of it. We were mostly excited for our son to have his own room.   We are so excited to continue to set everything in our new house and make it home."
