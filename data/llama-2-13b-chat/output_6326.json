        "Summarize the following story in first person: The event I am thinking of is when I got engaged. My fiance and I had just been on a long hike. At the end, he got down on his knee in the mud. When he asked me to marry him, we were surrounded by swans. The mud was the most memorable part. I couldn't believe he was willing to kneel in the mud and ruin his jeans for me! Sharing the news with my mother and family members was also quite memorable. This event was significant to me because we have been together for 3 years exactly. It happened on our 3 year anniversary. We are waiting 2 more years to save up enough money for the wedding, but knowing it will eventually happen fills me with indescribable joy and happiness. Our parents have also been pressuring us to get married, so it was nice to see how happy they were to hear the wonderful news as well. I can't wait to marry him. I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with him! Just talking about it again makes me elated. I am now in the wedding planning process."
