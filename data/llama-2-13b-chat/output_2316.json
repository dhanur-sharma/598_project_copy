        "Summarize the following story in first person: May was mine and my husband's 22nd wedding anniversary.  I really thought that it would really be just like any other day, we would probably exchange cards and have a nice dinner like usual but he had other plans.  He started off that morning with a surprise breakfast of homemade cinnamon apple pancakes and bacon and fresh squeezed orange juice served with a bouquet of flowers with our dog wearing a black bow tie.  Breakfast was delicious!  He then said that we were all going out for the day and to get ready for some outdoor fun.  We got ready and we drove up into the mountains where he had booked a boat ride for me, him and the dog and we got to speed around on the lake stopping to swim and just enjoy the sunshine.  We then set out to a little island and had a beautiful picnic on the private beach watching our dog run up and down the bank chasing and barking at the waves from the other boats going by.  We spent the afternoon just having fun and relaxing, the feel of the boat just making all life's problems disappear for just a little while.  We headed back to the marina and I figured our day was over but he had one more surprise for me that day.  We had to drop off our dog at our friends house for a little bit and got cleaned up and dressed and then we headed further into the mountains.     We stopped at a very fancy new restaurant and had a wonderful meal of fresh seafood and the best fried potatoes I have ever eaten along with freshly baked bread and a fabulous chocolate cake for dessert.  He had the waiter bring over fresh flowers and some wine as a special treat. My husband leaned over for a kiss and said that he still had one more surprise for me and to get ready for some fun!  We went just a little further and we were at the top of a mountain and I saw a hot air balloon.  I got so excited because I have been wanting to go on a hot air balloon ride for years.  We got in and it was breathtaking, we were there for a champagne sunset trip and the weather was gorgeous and we just held on to each other through the whole trip thankful that we are still happily married and so much in love.  The day was amazing from start to finish and I still think about it today."
