        "Summarize the following story in first person: My son has left the country.  That was what I thought to myself as I left the airport last week.  Those thoughts brought on a wave of emotions, both good and bad. My son, who has been a daily part of my life for the past 18 years, was going away.  My wife and I would not seen him again for about nine months.  We always knew when he graduated from high school that he would likely be leaving the state for college.   That expectation took on a new twist when he was accepted at a school that had a program allowing freshman student to apply to spend their entire first college year studying in Italy.  He was thrilled when he was accepted in to the program, and I was happy and proud.  However I was also nervous and sad. While I am exicted for him and the opportuniy he has in front of him over the next year, it still hurts to think of him being so far away.  The idea of \"losing\" someone I am used to seeing every day, that I won't be able to help him if he gets sick or hurt, hat we won't be able to take a walk together, or throw a ball, or share a soda, or just talk... leaves me with an empty feeling inside.  Sure we will text and email, and (hopefully) speak on the phone several times each week, but it is not the same. Should I feel guilty over being sad instead of happy for him?  In truth, I feel both.  I am proud to see him take another step towards growing up and becoming his own man... but I also miss my little boy."

I know that I am not losing him, just him physically.  But the distance between us will be a challenge for both of us.  I know that he is ready for this next step, and that he will be amazing, but it is hard for me to let go.  I am excited to see where this next year takes him, and what new experiences and knowledge he will gain.  I just hope that I can learn to be happy for him while still dealing with the pain of his absence.  Maybe it is time for me to find a new purpose in life, one that does not involve being his full-time caregiver.  Maybe it is time for me to start taking care of myself, to focus on my own needs and desires.  Maybe it is time for me to start living my own life, instead of just being a parent."
