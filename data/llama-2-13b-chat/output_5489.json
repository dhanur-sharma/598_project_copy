        "Summarize the following story in first person: A little over two weeks ago I was on an interview for a job at a software development company. I had really been polishing my skills on my own recently and really wanted this job, it's at a great company with amazing pay and growth potential. There were a few interviews for the position. One was with HR just them getting to know me and vice versa. Another was a technical interview going over some specific things listed on my resume and how I would solve certain software problems associated. The technical interview was the most nerve wracking but I thought it went okay. This was a long shot position that I just applied for to see if I'd get a callback and maybe some interview practice with a big software company. However, the most shocking part was when I got a call informing me I was being offered the position I applied for and if I was still interested. The wave of emotion and adrenaline was almost overwhelming, it was difficult to stay professional over the phone with this feeling rushing through me.  (This company was not Microsoft by the way but is a large well known company). I think part of the reason I was hired was because it isn't about the money or the prestige of working at a great place like this, but that I'm really just excited to learn about their process of finding solutions and developing software in this kind of scope and scale. It so far has been an amazing ride. Lastly, it seems there is an error in the hit. It says you need 15-25 sentences, currently seeing 13 OR you need 600-3000 characters, I am currently at 1560. Does the OR need to be an AND? Apparently so."
