        "Summarize the following story in first person: This event occurred 6 months ago, but I can still remember it clearly. After a long and grueling program in Post secondary education, I finally made it to graduation. I was then surprised by my mentor showing up at the ceremony, and she gave me my diploma! I was so excited to see that she cared enough to show up. I began crying and she hugged me and told me she was proud of me. I was amazed by the applause I received from my peers, and my family was extremely proud of me. I felt so accomplished for being the first person in 3 generations to complete a masters program and my father even shed a few tears when I went across the stage. It seemed that after endless hours of studying and tutoring sessions had finally paid off. I am now working with the University after being offered a full-time position after graduation. This was largely due to my mentor writing me an amazing letter of recommendation. I am now looking forward to working with students in the same way my mentor worked with me. I have met with several students who I am now an advisor to. I hope that in the coming years I can develop a relationship with them that will be like the one I had with my mentor. I will then continue the trend of being at my students graduation. I cannot think of a happier occasion in my life."
