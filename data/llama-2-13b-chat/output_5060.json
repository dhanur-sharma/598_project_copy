        "Summarize the following story in first person: I am 35 and I told my dad that I loved him for the first time that I can remember.  It was tough. The words just felt unnatural (at least in my head). I don't know if I said it to avoid the awkward silence or if I meant it. I really have only a few firsthand memories of my father growing up, all of which were positive. My mom always spoke poorly of him. I think I just believed he was this druggie/alcoholic loser that she made him out to be although I never saw him drunk or stoned that I was aware of. He lived out of state most of my life. From what I've been told, my parents eloped in Vegas after I was conceived and divorced before I was a year old. My mom never remarried or really even dated. But now that I'm getting to know him more, I'm learning there's a lot more than the labels my mom put on him and ingrained into my head. I'm kind of angry I never got the opportunity to learn this sooner. I remember always being afraid to ask for things without fearing some form of guilt relating to my father. When I was in middle school, I really wanted to play the saxophone. I worked up the courage to ask my mom. Per usual, she would tell me it was too expensive and to \"ask your father\". I was mentally punished for who my father was my entire life but I didn't even know him. Now that I'm getting to know him more as an adult, I wholeheartedly agree that I am a lot like him (looks, personality, etc.). I was always the black sheep of the family, so it's legit mind boggling to me to have so much in common with a relative for like the first time ever. I call him by his first name. I don't know if I'll ever adjust to calling him \"dad\" but I do remember I would dream of having a dad in my life as a kid. I think I am finally learning to understand myself, accept myself, and be myself."
