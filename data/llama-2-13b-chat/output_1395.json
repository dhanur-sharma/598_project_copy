        "Summarize the following story in first person: Everyone needs software. It is one of the most important, highest paying careers out there. It's also not a job everyone has the brainpower for. That makes me feel special. Translating need into software is what I do best. I've met so many people from around the world that I otherwise wouldn't meet and i'm thankful for that every day. This is a job i've wanted since I was a little girl because my dad was a software developer, so I really feel fulfilled. There is a lot of bad software ideas out in silicon valley like the juicero, but people with a real passion for innovation will always shine the brightest. In addition to fulfilling my dreams, I love my team. They are  hilarious and make a really hard job much easier. They are fast learners as well. We do many social activities together contrary to the computer nerd stereotype. We hike, go to dinners, watch TV shows like silicon valley together, go to workshops, and even Christmas parties. This is more than I did with my childhood friends of average intellect. I've been exposed to some of the brightest minds in the world from ivy leagues to natural homegrown talent and I could not be more thankful. I'm pretty sure I would not have the fulfillment at some dead end desk job like some of my old friends and my sister. They make living which is great in this say and age, but they get burned out so easily. I'm truly thankful for the path I took in life"
