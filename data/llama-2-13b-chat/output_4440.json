        "Summarize the following story in first person: Oh my god so two weeks ago I had a very emotional experience. My daughter had her first day of school. I went to graduate school, she grew up seeing me continuing my education. She is going to be doing the same thing! And going to the same school that I went to! Oh how I've changed from the days of hard partying. To now I get so emotional seeing her doing what she loves. You can see it in her eyes. She isn't just doing this to please her daddy. You can see that she really truly wants to do this. She's talked about wanting to go to the same school that I went to for years. No one can prepare you for the wave of emotions that you will get when you have children. And then not only having said child but getting to see them grow. Getting to see them make decisions on their own. She is growing up so fast! It's difficult to imagine her being old enough to leave the home and attend graduate school. I am crying tears of joy!"
