        "Summarize the following story in first person: Today is the day of the competition, we were so excited but apprehensive about this trip, Ben has been preparing for several months but are you ever really prepared? I could not sleep last night because I was so worried about this event and I hoped I was able to support Ben accordingly. How would I react if things don't go to plan? We have spent so much money and time on this. We got there around 6am, traffic was shockingly less than expected! The parking lot was full already but we managed to grab a space thanks to someone leaving. We remembered to take everything along we needed, costume, skates, snacks. Tony, my husband was exhausted and suffering from a cold. My older son, S, was not thrilled about attending this event and wanted to go home. I was hoping I could bribe him to enjoy things by saying he could pick where we ate dinner. Ben was excited and not even remotely nervous. I was a wreck but pretending to be fine! Ben got into costume around 7am, practice ice went well and he seemed happy and content. We then saw the kids he would be competing against and felt a pang of nerves, how could this little kid compete against kids much bigger and stronger than him?! He did not seem phased at all. Another boy and his family were there but they were not remotely friendly, they kept glaring at us which made me feel irritated and also nervous. One of Ben's friends, a little girl skated and did ok but did not win, she came 4th in her event. This made me worry for Ben and start telling myself this whole trip was a waste of money. It was time for Ben to skate and we all held our breath, he did an amazing job and we were not sure if it was good enough to win but it was good. Ben's coach said \"he has got this, he will win\" and we waited for the scores, trying to not get too excited. The scores took forever to be announced but when they were, sure enough, he had won! It was time to calm down and congratulate the other skaters on their skates and try to not appear too boastful. We waited for the medal ceremony but heard nothing. We then had the medal ceremony which was incredibly rewarding and then the event was over! We were exhausted and went home. And it was still only 10:30am!"
