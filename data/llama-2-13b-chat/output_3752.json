        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 4 months ago I lost my hero. In the middle of the night, I learned my aunt died in a car accident. My aunt was the most beautiful and strongest person I ever met. She was always the black sheep of the family. Never played by any one elses rules. She never cared what other people thought. When people judged her, she challenged them to think harder and be more critical. She changed my entire life really. She is the one that told me to question everything. That I can only know what I've experienced myself. That so many people in life just follow the person in front of them, and never really know what it is like to live. They don't even know themselves. She challenged me to become a more well rounded person. To think outside of myself and care about other people. She showed me that living a truly fulfilling life meant learning about myself and what I care about and then sharing that with the world. It was about helping other people.  She also taught me that dying is only scary if you were never living in the first place. So I know death was not scary for her. I will always love and admire her."
