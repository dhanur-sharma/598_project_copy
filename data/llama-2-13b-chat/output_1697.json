        "Summarize the following story in first person: A memorable moment that happened to me within the last 3-6 months would be my trip to Yellowstone National Park. I took a week off to drive to the park, and to set up the campsite that I have reserved. The memorable moment of this trip would be when I was hiking in upper Yellowstone. After seeing several geysers, such as Old Faithful, I also wanted to go on some hikes and trails, specifically in Lamar Valley near the northeast entrance. It was in the afternoon, and I had already been able to experience and observe many bison and wildlife that I had normally never seen in the wild, only through pictures or a zoo setting. Seeing the wildlife in person, and often much closer than I would have preferred was a great experience in its own right, more so as I would recollect incidents of wildlife attacking people for venturing too close to them. Keeping my distance as much as I could on the trail, I kept on walking, taking in the scenery and occasionally getting wet from the occasional rain that basked the area. After walking for a bit, I would eventually come across an animal I had hoped to come across, but in person would fill me with fear and awe. A large bear ended up walking near the trail, a bear that had notably brown fur. I had previously encountered several black bears in my life, a couple even as I was driving in Yellowstone, but not this type of bear much less this close up. It was no doubt a grizzly bear, evident by its pronounced hump in its back, a feature not commonly shared with other bears. The distance between me and the bear no doubt put me in notable danger, although the bear was evidently focused on other things, likely foraging for food given the time of day. I attempted to remember all the advice and information I read about dealing with grizzly bears, such as not making sudden movements such as running away. Staying in place yet making my presence known, the bear would eventually walk away from the trail, ending any potential danger from the confrontation. Despite the danger, I was glad to experience and photograph up close a grizzly bear, given how synonymous it is to the park, and even the state I traveled from. It would have been possible that I could hike in Yellowstone for hours on end, even days and not come across a grizzly bear, at any distance given timing or even luck. For this encounter, I am fortunate to experience an aspect of nature that reminds me of nature's beauty and majesty, along with its danger and potential risk."
