        "Summarize the following story in first person: The story I am going to tell you seems to resemble Cinderella's story but vice versa. To put them in context, I have been living with my boyfriend for a year, who is divorced and has a 15-year-old daughter. My boyfriend's daughter travels from another state to visit her for once a month. Every time her daughter travels she feels obliged to share with me and it is obvious that she doesn't like it at all. The last month he came to visit something unexpected happened that definitely changed the way we live for all three. One afternoon when I went shopping with my boyfriend and she stayed at home, he received a call from his daughter telling him that his milk (because you have to buy milk separately) had a strange taste like jabornWhen we returned from shopping, my boyfriend provoked the milk and actually tasted of soap, so he told her it was safe and we voted for it. The next day she left for the airport back home and when she could contact lenses told her that they burned a lot, then my boyfriend told him to wear others, she changed them and went home. In the afternoon she called my boyfriend and told him that during the trip his eyes were still burning and that when he got home he checked the liquid in his glasses and it smelled like Clorox, so he had to discard it, that She believed that it was I who was doing all this for evil. My boyfriend talked to me and told me that we weren't going to be able to stay together for what I was going through. My reaction was to cry and tell him that I could not live without him not telling me that I would never do that to her. My boyfriend was incredulous at the beginning he asked me many questions and in the end it seems he believed me. The next one, my boyfriend's daughter called him and told him that his laptop had been damaged and that when he took it to the technician he told him that the circuits had burned because he had poured water on her, according to her this was the proof that indeed I I was intentionally hurting him. My boyfriend told his daughter that he didn't believe her and her reaction was to block his phone and not talk to him for a week. My boyfriend in the face of that pressure decided to tell him that I had already gone back to my home country, and with this the girl spoke to her father again. Now every time she returns to visit her father, I must go with all my personal things to spend these days with my boyfriend's mother."
