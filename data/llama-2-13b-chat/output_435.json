        "Summarize the following story in first person: I remember exactly how it ended. That morning you asked if I would be happier without you. Unsure, I remained silent. I was hoping you would reassure me that I wouldn't be. Instead, you took my silence as an affirmation that I would be better off. You went to work and I went on with my day as normal. Little did I know that everything had changed. Days later, I tried to reconnect and work on the relationship, but you were no longer interested. It hurt me tremendously. I was counting on you for years, and despite all our problems, I was still trying to fix things. Used to our fights, I expected things to fall back into place in the next few weeks, since we could never stay away from each other for too long. That never happened. I reluctantly began going on dates with other people to try to move on and heal from your rejection, and you took that as a sign that I was seeking something or something else. I didn't know what else to do to try to fix something you didn't want anymore. Months later, we remain separated and rarely talk. It's still unbelievable to me because I never imagined we could go longer than a day without taking to each other. I have yet to tell my parents that it ended. I think that's because part of me is still holding on to hope that we'll work out. However, I'm simultaneously starting to accept that things are this way. Even though I still miss you, I no longer have the desire to tell you about everything that happens in my life. I no longer have the urge to talk to you all the time or think about you constantly. It's unfamiliar, but I guess this is what you wanted. I don't know the details of your life anymore and that's ok. In the end, I just hope we're both happy wherever we end up. I just never would have imagined it ending this way."
