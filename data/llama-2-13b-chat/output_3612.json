        "Summarize the following story in first person: I recently broke up with my long term girlfriend. We had been dating seriously for over 5 years. As time had gone on we had grown further & further apart. We both had sexual relationships outside our relationship & we no longer seemed to be sexually attracted to each other. Our relationship had become cold & I knew it was time to be honest with myself & her & just move on. I think the last straw for me was my grandmother dying plus me writing her a happy birthday email & getting no response. I told her I was done with her & she got very emotional. It didn't have any effect on me. I had just become hardened to her. I didn't want the relationship to continue & told her I didn't even want to be her friend. She tried a few weeks later contacting me but I yelled at her. I felt bad about it but we both just needed to move on. Hopefully someday we can be friends again. I'm not sure if it'll happen though. Too much water under the bridge."
