        "Summarize the following story in first person: I asked my girlfriend Alicia to marry me. She initially said yes. But then as we talked more, she was always too busy or had some other excuse to avoid making real plans. After she did so a few times, it became obvious to me that she didn't really want to do it. But whenever asked about it, she always acted very positive about it. It was a very strange disconnect between words and actions. I wanted to believe her. But it also scared me that she was possibly a really smooth liar and manipulator. At best, she was excessively unreliable and disorganized. I had given her enough chances. I didn't want to admit it after having such a great first impression of her, but it was not going to work. I knew she would be an important person in my life, and she was. But she wasn't going to be 'the one.' She was another girl who existed to teach me the nature of women. It is unfortunate that I had to accept this reality. But it forged me to be better next time."
