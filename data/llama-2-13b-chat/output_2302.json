        "Summarize the following story in first person: For my birthday and combined Christmas gift, my husband got me tickets to go see the Backstreet Boys. I was SO excited that I was finally getting the chance to see them. I have loved the band since I was a kid, so at least 20 years. Not only did I get tickets, but I got tickets in a really great area of the venue so I had a good view. We had a lot of fun at the concert. Before the show started they had a block party set up with a bunch of neat things to do. People sang karaoke and took pictures of themselves with big cutouts of the BSBs heads. I got a shirt that is actually a little big for me so I wear it as a night shirt. The venue we went to has a VIP club that you can purchase for an extra cost so you don't have to stand outside and wait in line. This was interesting and fun because we got to sit in an AC room and have drinks and food without having to worry about losing our spot in line. It also had a private bathroom that we could access during the show if we needed to. The show itself was SO good. The boys still sound as good as they did 20 years ago. They sang all the songs I was hoping they would sing. I'd love to see them again in the future!"
