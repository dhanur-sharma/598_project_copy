Maybe later when I had trained more, but I wasn't sure now was the time. Dave, the bastard, goaded me into doing and I guess he was right. What did I have to lose except my pride. Something he said I have too much of anyways. But I did take the test. And I passed it. Sure, it took until the last attempt, but they don't track that in your record. There is just a rubber stamp saying passed, and that's all I wanted. It felt so relieving and redeeming to finally pass the test! And a bit surprising. Just goes to show that you never know until you try. And that Dave is actually worth having around. Now on to my career!"
