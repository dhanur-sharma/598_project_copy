        "Summarize the following story in first person: A woman came in late one evening to the hospital who was very obviously in labor. It was about 4 months ago but it was one of the most memorable events during clinical rotation that I've ever witnessed. The woman who was very heavily pregnant was with her partner waiting to check in. While her partner filled out paperwork and answered questions, the woman leaned against the wall for support. Finally and none too soon, the woman was rushed into an exam room where her water broke and chaos ensued. The on call doctor announced that woman was already crowning and that she was ready to deliver. There was no time to call others into the room. I stepped up and followed the orders given to me by the doctor. The woman who was ill prepared for natural childbirth, tried her best to push and push but you could tell she was exhausted. I did my best to comfort her and coach her through contractions. Not twenty minutes after the woman's arrival, her baby was born into a hastily set up exam room. I stayed with the woman and her partner and witnessed their first moments as a family until nurses arrived. This is the field that I have chosen to enter and witnessing my first birth really made me more sure of my decision. There's nothing like seeing a new life enter the world and seeing a family together for the first time. As I continue my training, I try to keep this event fresh in my memory as inspiration to keep going."
