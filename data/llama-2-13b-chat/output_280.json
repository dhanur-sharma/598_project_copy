        "Summarize the following story in first person: About a week ago, I was asked by a relative to conduct the service and eulogy for my recently deceased grandfather. I hadn't seen or spent much time with my grandfather in years so I was surprised at this request. Nevertheless, I accepted the responsibility. I spent some time putting together all of the details of the service which only took a few hours. Once I was done with that, I started working on writing his eulogy. For a long time, I was stumped about what to say. I thought about how we hadn't seen each other in a while and I began to think that I shouldn't be the one writing his eulogy in the first place. After a few moments, I remembered a day that my grandfather and I spent together when I was about 10 years old. We were on a boat out on the lake with fishing gear. My grandfather wanted to teach me how to fish but I wasn't really interested at the time. I tried to catch fish but they always escaped. I started getting upset. My grandfather could see this and started to pretend the fish got away every time he caught one. He wanted to make sure I didn't feel alone and laughed at himself to show me that fishing wasn't something to be too serious about. It was about spending time with your family and having fun. I finished writing the eulogy and during the service, I read it out loud while my relatives looked on. After the service, I felt sad but also happy that I got to relive a beautiful moment with my grandfather."
