        "Summarize the following story in first person: Since my own mother died when I was younger, I have become close to my husband's mother and maintain an affectionate correspondence with her. She is not my mom but I love her for who she is all the same. In the past few months my mother-in-law has been quite ill. In the last month, I learned that she has stage 2 borderline stage 3 lung cancer involving a large mass in the lung. I saw her last week for the first time since her diagnosis when she stopped to spend a night with us while on her to begin cancer treatment. She was in good spirits despite the long journey. She joked about death and mentioned doing her 'dying person' prayers. Being a feminist and an incredibly open-minded person, she was extremely supportive towards me and my unconventional career choices, encouraging me. Everything felt suspended in disbelief and she was filled with more tenderness than usual. In a way this surprised me because she has many reasons to be angry: with her doctors or with life in general for striking her with cancer, in addition to many other misfortunes. She was relaxed and calm and put on a good face but she also looked frail and had lost a significant amount of weight. The next morning she got up early and when we said goodbye to her, she seemed so small and impotent and alone. She looked at both of us directly - her son and me - and somehow I felt that we all understood what is at stake here. As she drove off I wondered if I would see her again. Her visit and seeing her has made me feel many things. I grieve that she has to face this terrible disease and I feel a deep sorrow for my husband, who has been sleeping poorly, worried and more quiet than usual. He would not be who he is today -- respectful towards women, kind, loving, patient -- if it were not for his mother. He does not want to lose her. I feel a sense of total powerlessness in the face of death and the passage of time. I think about how my mother-in-law has lived this amazing, full life, always doing what she wanted even when it was the controversial choice. I think about the vast emptiness of not being able to talk to her again or to be able to email her or see her. I think about how I could have visited her last year but chose not to because it was too cold and rainy where she lived, and I assumed I would have many more chances to see her. I think about how all of us are suspended in disbelief in every moment, unsure about when death will happen to us. It is incredibly overwhelming and I try to be as kind as I can to myself and to everyone around me, it is all I can do, it seems. I do not know what else I can do."
