        "Summarize the following story in first person: when my husband and i decided to file for bankruptcy we had no idea what we were really doing and if it would indeed help us in the long run or hurt us.  going through the entire process was very stressful and we had to meet up with the lawyer a few times.  we were embarrassed that it came to that point that we even had to consider doing what we did but we knew after talking to the lawyer that we were making the right decision for us.  we werent those people who had to file because of over spending on luxuries, we were just a normal couple who went through a hard time after having our first son and then job changes and just needed a little boost in the right direction. we got information for the lawyer from my mother in law and moved forward right away.  we had to have meetings with the lawyer and get all of our paper work straightened out and bills laid out for him to see.  after everything was put together we had to meet downtown with our lawyer to have the court date and to finalize everything.  our lawyer was very helpful and it was very reassuring to see other couples and people just like us that were there to do the exact same thing as us.  it was all over very fast and the entire process was painless. after going through the entire process and it all finally being over, we learned a lot, not only about our finances but also ourselves.  our lawyer helped us out so much and told us that this was a fresh start for us that not everyone gets.  we knew that after filing we had to manage our money better and try to start saving.  since filing months ago we have been able to save a little bit of money, not as much as we would like, but it is a step in the right direction.  we know now that by going through that together we will be able to handle anything as a couple and as a family.  the whole thing made us stronger and was a blessing in disguise."
