        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last week I won my first Brazilian Jiu Jitsu match! I was so nervous about competing and I can't believe I actually won! I can't describe how amazing it felt to win! I worked so hard training for this tournament and my hard work paid off.  I was so happy after winning and has motivated me to keep training in Jiu Jitsu. I believe I found something I could really be good at. The match wasn't as hard as I was expecting and I would have loved to keep competing that day. I hope I can be in another tournament. I know that I will have to train harder than ever so I can keep winning matches. I want to start a new workout routine that includes Jiu Jitsu as well as other exercises to help me with the next competition. I also want to get my diet in check so my body will be in tip top shape for competing. I still can't get over the fact that I won!! My mind keeps replaying the match and I feel silly for being so nervous. I keep trying to focus on my new training regiment but I just keep going back to the memory of the match.  I am so happy that my hard work paid off and I have found something I believe I am good at. I am already counting down to my next match!"
