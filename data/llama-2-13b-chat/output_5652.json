        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 3 months ago I was playing sports. I played baseball and my team was pretty good. we made it to the playoffs and eventually made it to the championship game. It wasn't always good however there were times were we lost and didn't make it that far. This year was different however. we were really good and didn't lose at all. we did have some close games but etched those games out to win as well. we ended up making it to the playoffs again it's been a long ride. we finally ended up losing one in the playoffs which hurt our standings at the time. we had to win out every single game after that in order to make it to the championship game. we were able to do just that it was a challenge but we did it. winning the championship game was the most exciting because thats what we've been working for all year long. So once that game was finally over it was a sigh of relief. The entire team celebrated and we enjoyed our championship. Overall this has been a good season and I think we deserved to win big."
