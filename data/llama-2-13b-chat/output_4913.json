        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was the most wonderful night of my life. I'm actually still shocked as to how amazing the entire evening went. Me and my boyfriend went to this beautiful Mexican restaurant, I had cheese enchiladas, rice, and beans while he had  steak chimichangas. The dinner was amazing and I'm sure the waitress was really happy too for the big tip she got. For months we had waited for this night. Tonight was the night that one of our favorite artists would be in town and we had bought tickets a long time ago. The artist was Electric Light Orchestra, and now that we were done eating we were heading to see the show. Tonight would be the last night I would see my boyfriend for the entire summer so we wanted to make it special. Me and my boyfriend absolutely love live music, one of our favorite things to do is go to shows and I'm so glad we went to this one. We couldn't believe it, Electric Light Orchestra opened with most favorite song! We spent the entire night listening to good music and eating food. We were in love and nothing could change that not even a summer apart from each other.  We didn't worry about a single thing all night, just enjoying ourselves and each other's company.  I don't think this is a night i'll ever forget the rest of my life and it's already been four months since it happened. My boyfriend is going to be back soon since summer is almost over, I can't wait. I usually don't wait this long to write into my diary but it's taken me this long just to process how magical this night was."
