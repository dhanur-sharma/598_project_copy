        "Summarize the following story in first person: Five months ago, my baby's birth was a scary experience! It was my first child and I was so excited! It was a very fast labor. It only lasted an hour and a half. We were lucky we got to the hospital in time. It was especially nerve-racking because we had to drive through a blizzard for 30 minutes before we got there. I was well trained and kept my cool during the whole experience. I started the deep breathing before we left the house. Not only was there a blizzard, but it was dark! I prayed and prayed and kept a positive attitude throughout the experience. When she was born, they immediately took her to the side to examine her. This was after getting the cord from around her neck. I was worried, but kept a good attitude. Thank goodness she is so strong and perfect! Thank you everyone!"
