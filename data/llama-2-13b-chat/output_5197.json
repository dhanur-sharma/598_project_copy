        "Summarize the following story in first person: Depression really sucks, but I think I'm finally starting to get a better handle on it. I accepted a job offer two months ago and am really liking the work I do. It's very meaningful and rewarding to see all the people I can help on a daily basis. The pay also isn't too bad either. My office and coworkers are both as nice as I could have asked for too, so I'm pretty excited for the first time in a long while. I spent months and months stressed out and depressed about not having any work, so this is big. I was declined by more companies than I could count during my job search. I really started to look inward and blame myself too, which I have now learned is the wrong way to interpret the situation. Some of the online classes I've been taking have really helped me see how poor my mindset was for all those years. I really regret not getting a handle on my depression earlier. These classes are truly helping me in ways I never imagined, and I know I can translate some of what I'm learning into my daily life both personally and professionally. Any stress I might experience at work will not affect me in the ways it used to in the past. That much I know for sure! There will definitely be tough days ahead without question though, so I know I need to stay focused on getting my mind in a healthier place. With this new job helping to take my mind off the financial struggles of my life though, I think I'm going to end up being just fine!"
