        "Summarize the following story in first person: Dear Diary, This has been the worst year of my life. I won't get into everything now, but I just can't stop thinking about my father. About 5 or 6 months ago now, I went to work like any other day. Got to my cubicle, started up my computer and started designing the catalog spreads. Everything was going just fine. That's when my mom called. Dad was in a car accident. He was being life-flighted to the hospital in critical condition and I needed to get to Maine ASAP. I don't remember if I even told my boss I was leaving, I just got up and ran out. I may not have even punched out. Traffic, of course, was terrible as it was a holiday weekend. It took me an hour to even get out of town, when normally it takes 20 minutes. The whole time, I was panicked. I tried to keep my cool because, no sense in getting into an accident myself. That's when I got another call. It was my mom again, she was in tears. She wanted to tell me, so I didn't fly there as fast as she knew I was, that he passed away on arrival to the hospital. His injuries were just too severe. I pulled over, and broke down. I have lived in New Hampshire for a couple years now, but have always wanted to move back to Maine where I am from. I can't believe I didn't move back in time. This truly has been the worst year of my life."
