        "Summarize the following story in first person: I'm honestly a pretty simple person. I have a good family, I love to work, and I also have good friends. To me, having good friends and family is probably the most important thing to me. I know that if something were to ever happen to me, I would have my friends and family to back me up on it. Speaking of back up, I also love my job as a Program Service Evaluator. I think that working is one of the most important things that a person can do because, without working it would be extremely difficult to support yourself and the ones you love. I love to be able to provide for everyone in my family because it makes me feel important and like I matter to them. In my job as a PSE, I have to determine whether people qualify for government issued benefits. Not everyone qualifies, but everyone is always able to apply. It is a particularly difficult job that I wish paid more than it did. That doesn't mean I dislike it though. I wake up every day waiting for the new challenge that awaits me at work. It seems as though there is always a new scenario. The policy manual isn't always clear either. But I think that keeps the job fresh and interesting."
