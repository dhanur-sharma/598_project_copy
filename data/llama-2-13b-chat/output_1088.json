        "Summarize the following story in first person: Dear Diary, I know I'm probably sounding like a broken record talking about how the best thing in my life happened six months ago because of a dinner I had, but I only feel somewhat guilty for that because honestly I'm just really really happy. I haven't got to talk about what officially it is now so I guess I'll just start with being invited to dinner by my boss. I don't go to the steakhouse we went to very often, heck I'm gonna be honest, I was freaking about going in general. I love the idea of having a good top sirloin, but on my intern salary that's not really a thing. I would never say no to a boss though and eating dinner went good. I mean, actually better than good, pretty great. We talked about maybe starting full time at the desk position I've been dropping hints about all year. Like actually have a start date to train and everything. I went and sat at the bar afterwards to celebrate when the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my life sat next to me. Needed me to pretend to be her cousin Jim because some sleeze ball wouldn't leave her alone. Ended up talking and her name was Vanessa. Talked about any and everything honestly. What she thinks of politics ( I like to get that out of the way ahead of time), what her view is on whiskey, how she likes her eggs cooked. I'm gonna be honest, that's a big thing for me because runny eggs are awful. Anyway, we've been talking this whole time off and on. Random text messages, like the one I got rubbing in mu face that the Patriots finally lost. I had told her I thought Brady would do one more superbowl before retiring, but I guess hindsight is 20/20. I finally asked her to be my girlfriend that day so I guess you could say the Pats won something for me lol. I now have an amazing girlfriend, a start to a dream job, and an excitement for the future. And to think, all of this because I agreed to a steak dinner."
