        "Summarize the following story in first person: I went to a bachelor party a week ago. It was just as wild and eye opening as I was expecting with the opportunity to meet tons of new people to share life with. I was so surprised at everything we did. The groom's brother, was the best man and he planned everything. We started the night out with a nice poker game. We played for about an 2 hours. Great game of friends and the groom ended up winning the most which is great since he is the groom. After we finished our game we went to a loyal strip club for some fun and dinner. The show was great lots of beautiful women. The owner who was a friend of Jack's even had the lady's do a special show just for us to celebrate groom's last day of being a bachelor. Great music and great dancing I will never forget. When we were done we went back to groom's brother, and sleep for a couple hours. We had a 7am fight to go see the Cowboys play. I am not a fan, but Alex loves them and this was his day or should I say days.  We showed up at the station a couple hours early. We were all a little confused why and then to our surprise the manager of the Cowboys comes out and leads us to the field. Another friend there works for the owner in one of his other businesses and got us in to meet the whole team.  These was the best bachelor party I have ever been too. And I am glad groom had the time of his life. We flew back to town the next day and groom was married a day later. I wish him all the luck and happiest in his marriage."
