        "Summarize the following story in first person: It all started this summer for my family reunion.  The Ricardo Family Reunion was to be held as a 2 day event, staring on Saturday, June 20th and Sunday, June 21st.  It was a lovely day.  On Saturday we held a family picnic at the Pavilion.  My family came from everywhere Franklin Louisiana, New Orleans Louisiana, Houston Texas, Phoenix Arizona, and Los Angeles California.  We played baseball, basketball, volleyball and the kids had a water slide.   We had a large selection of food.   We traced our family generation back as far as 9 generation. We learned so much about where we came from and how strong of a family line we have.   The children enjoyed them self, playing with cousin they and Aunts and Uncles that just met or haven't seen in a long time.    My great-great-great grandfather was an Indian Chief.  We learn that we belong to the Cherokee Indians.  My family is mixed with Spanish, and French.   We listen to stories told my the elders about events that had happen in their days.  We were told stories about how the family stayed and worked together.   We talked about the many fishing boats that the family had on Grand Isles.   We also visited Madewood plantation where  my Grandfather, Mr. Ricardo, had done a lot of work in restoring the plantation.  We even went to New Orleans and toured the city.  We visited  where my grandfather, Mr. Ricardo,  had did some work in the French Quarter.  The next day we all celebrated by going to Mass together.  Being with family is a blessing and sometime we let the world and material things get in our way and make us forget about what is important.  The best time is spending it with family, united in love and doing the simple things in life."
