        "Summarize the following story in first person: My sister passed away after a long battle with cancer.  I am glad she is now at peace.  I miss her so much.  Watching her slowly wither away was the worst of it all.  I watched her go from a beautiful flower, so full of life, to a wilted plant close to death.  At her funeral they made her up to look beautiful.  When they placed her in the ground, she looked just as beautiful as I wanted to remember her.  I hope this is the way she feels now that she is in heaven.  Every day is a battle.  I miss her so much.  I know she is at peace now, but I can't help to be angry.  Why would God take her away at such a young age??  Why is someone as sweet at her dead, while so many others who are terrible people are still alive?? My heart is broken.  I don't know what I am going to do.  I feel like part of me died with her.  I try to think that she is in a better place.  She is free from pain.  But how do I know for sure??"
