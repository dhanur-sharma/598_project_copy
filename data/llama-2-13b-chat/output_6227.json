        "Summarize the following story in first person: I often thought I knew what happiness was. I often thought I knew what love was. I had no idea what either were until I looked into my daughter's eyes for the very first time. Three months ago, I stood anxiously holding my wife's hand as she delivered our first child. When it was nearly time, the doctor told me to look and there she was, my wife was delivering a perfect, beautiful baby girl. As I nervously cut the umbilical cord, my daughter opened her eyes to look at me. In that instance, I knew what happiness and love was. A few moments later, as I sat with my wife and daughter, my heart nearly exploded for both of them. I couldn't believe that my wife had just gone through the most painful event ever to give me this perfect baby. Over the course of the last few months, my love and happiness has grown each day even through sleep deprivation. My wife and I are truly a team when it comes to this child-rearing business but I am not arrogant enough to think we have it all figured out. I know we have nothing figured out but we are finding our way. At night, when it is my time to get up with our daughter, I can't help but smile when I look at her. It's totally hard to believe that we created this perfect, little human. I am sure there are trials and tribulations to come but. for right now, I am simply enjoying these moments."
