        "Summarize the following story in first person: Dear Diary,Tomorrow will make 1 whole month since I married the love of my life in front of all of our family and friends. The days leading up to our wedding day was so stressful just trying to plan it all and I kept thinking how we should have just eloped. I'm so glad we didn't elope though, because our wedding day was amazing. I remember walking down the aisle to my love so vividly. I couldn't take my eyes off of him and I felt like I was dreaming. I remember thinking, \"Wow! We're actually getting married. I'm actually getting married to the love of my life\". I remember feeling so happy that my father was able not only walk me down the aisle, but also witness this day. The ceremony was everything we wanted...short, sweet, and simple. We said our vows, sealed it with a kiss, and then were on to take pictures after the ceremony. We were a bit shocked to see some of our closest guests, or at least we thought were our closest guests, not bother to show up to our wedding. However, we didn't dwell on it too much. One of the many highlights of our day was seeing how happy our families were to celebrate our day with us. We literally danced the night away and it was so nice to actually have a moment after all of these months where I allowed myself to have fun. As the reception ended, I remember my love and I reflecting on how that night was just a glimpse of how amazing our marriage would be. Tomorrow will make 1 whole month since I married the love of my life and I am truly blessed!"
