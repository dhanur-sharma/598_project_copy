        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was recently involved in a somewhat stressful incident at college. I bunk up with 5 other roommates at college, so 6 of us total in one apartment. At the start of the semester we all got along really well, but by the end of it, we were fighting more. We had one situation in particular that stuck out to me. I was sitting, as we usually did, 5 of us in the living room, because the 6th man was going a little crazy- I do not know if it was his meds or what, but we were just watching TV as a group and it was awesome we did that a lot. Anyway, 6th man walks in, well him and (lets call him 4th man- 4th being the number of his bedroom just like 6 is for 6th man) 4th man got into some heated arguments recently. 4th man is a ripped dude who got me to go to the gym for the first time in my life, and I am sticking to it, been going for about 4 months straight now and I feel great. So we all agree if 6th man tried something 4th man could just take him no problem and we were all kind of secretly hoping someone would show him how stupid and petty he was being(6th man). He kept on complaining when we did not invite him to stuff. At first it was not on purpose, but then we did kind of stop inviting him to stuff just because he kept freaking out that we did not like him or whatever the heck he was thinking. Truth is, he stayed in his room most of the time - so, yeah, we are not inviting you because we JUST made the plans like 1 hour ago, not on purpose, just with whoever was in the living room. We should not have to specifically go in to everyone's rooms to personally invite them to something. Hang out, and you actually hang out with us. Hang in, and you are gonna miss out, not because we hate you, but because you just are not hanging out with us. Anyway, 6th man wanted something from the fridge, so he goes and 4th man is already in the fridge door. Now, I'll admit 4th man egged it on JUST a little, but he did egg it on by standing in the door acting like he did not see 6th man for just a second. 6th man says move, grabs his thing and then as he is walking to his room says, \"if you ever do that again I'll slap you so hard you're gonna wish you had never been born\" boom, slams the door and walks to his room. We all we like, \"4th man, what did you do?!\"  So 4th man was telling us, \"I did not do anything except grab my stuff from the fridge, lol\".. So the fact that 4th man was also like wtf? made us realize it was just 6th man being crazy. Well, 6th man sends a text to 4th man saying that he knows why 4th mans girlfriend of 2 years just broke up with him, saying he was a piece of crap, etc. Well we all did not see the text since it was just to 4th man, so 4th man gets up and says, \"thats it\". Oh crap! lol, We all knew it was about to go down, so I tell the other dude in the apartment who was a big, tall guy to get in there, and he totally does. Long story short, nothing happened thankfully, but that whole situation was freaking crazy for the whole semester."
