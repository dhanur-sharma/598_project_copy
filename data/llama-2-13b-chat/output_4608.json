        "Summarize the following story in first person: One day I went and got my mail out of the mail box and my husband received a birthday card from his sister. A few minutes later my husband called form work as he always does everyday and he tell me open  the card. I open the card and I was expecting a check for maybe 30 dollars as she usually does every year.  Out of the card a check falls onto the table and it is written for 1,650. 00 . I tell this to my husband and he was surprised, we both thought maybe she made a mistake. Now I hang up the phone and before I do that ,  my husband states I will call you  back I am going to call her.  I thought maybe she sent a wrong check and this was for a bill she was suppose to pay. I did get that call back and it was correct ,she wanted to help us pay-off a loan we had for a mobile home we bought.  Shocked and delighted it was something that was so surprising. they are not rich but doing well . I felt great that the gift would help us finely own our own home after all the things we have been through. After the check cleared we did go to the bank to pay-off  this loan. Our life had been difficult  with losing a home due to serious illness and job loss. Having a place of our own again and starting again  makes the gift even more amazing.   We did send a thank-you card to his sister and brother-in-law , it funny how good things seem to harvest other good things.  When your mind feels good about your life I am guessing it opens up your life for more blessings. The love and caring of family is something that money can not replace , because it was a gift of love .  Family can sometimes be a curse and a blessing when they say I see what you have been through and want to help."
