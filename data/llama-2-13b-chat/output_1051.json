        "Summarize the following story in first person: I recently had a few different drastically life changing events take place. One of which is the beginning of a divorce. After ten years of marriage, my husband decided he wanted a divorce. After some of the awful things he did in our marriage, I was still hanging in hoping we could move past all the hurt and betrayal. But unfortunately, he got fed up with the process and decided to end it. Just within the last three months I have agreed to give him the divorce, had him lash out at me in unspeakable ways, been forced to move due to lack of ability to continue paying for the previous place and had to pick up the pieces for myself and my three young children. I thank God that he has given me several people in my life that have been there for me and helped me through all of this. Without them, it would have been way worse. I am still trying to get through this divorce, but I have faith that the Lord will work all this for good. Many other changes have come along with this divorce. Of course the move. The change in family dynamic, which has been the worst and most difficult change. The financial changes. The emotional changes in me, which I struggle with every single day. The coping of my children. Yes, this has been quite the emotional roller coaster. I am still looking to the Lord for daily strength."
