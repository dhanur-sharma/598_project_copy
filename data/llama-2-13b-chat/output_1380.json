        "Summarize the following story in first person: During the Haiti charity event, instructors from all around the area came together to showcase their talents in the form of dance. There were all types of genres from Zumba, Hip-hop, mixed fit, etc. The event altogether lasted around 3 hours. Each group was allowed to perform twice for rounds of 10 minutes each. There had never been an event like this before, so it was intense, fun, and only at the price of $15 for admission. Each group that went on showed power, intensity, and all around had a great time. All of the groups on the sidelines cheered on for each other and took pictures and videos of the event and the groups performing. We all had a love for each other that could not be explained. I truly felt part of a community bigger than myself and was proud of each and every group that performed. My greatest surprise were the students attending the event. They danced NON STOP for three hours straight. The physical capability and determination was beyond overwhelming. In the end everyone was exhausted, but so happy at the event turnout. The event was a huge success because we were able to raise a lot of funds and get a lot of donations for the children in Haiti for their upcoming school year. After this event was over, we were already planning to do another event just like this one, and many of the groups were already planning for the future."
