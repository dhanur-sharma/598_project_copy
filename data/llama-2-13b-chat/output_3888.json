        "Summarize the following story in first person: TERATOMA, ENCEPHALITIS, these are words that I had never heard before and in all honesty, never wish to hear again. These are words that caused a fully functioning adult and changed her into a child. A child who has to depend on everyone around her to keep her clean, to keep her healthy , to help her relearn to walk . I had a good life, great job, great coworkers or so I thought. In July of 2018 i started having symptoms of many things, none of which I would ever imagined would be a mass on my ovaries. I knew something was wrong with me, I did not feel like myself but I continued to do my everyday activities, going to my job, working out on my treadmill, occasionally lifting weights with my home gym. I was eating healthy and losing weight everyday, which I had finally gotten under control. One day I was picking up my car from the garage down the street and on my way home I thought I had passed my house. I literally had no idea where I was, and that was pretty f'in scary. I went to my PCP and told her I was no longer comfortable to drive. I had been driving everyday since I was 17 years old. I was able to work at home thanks to my employer but the more I worked, the less focused I was. I initially thought it was due to my vision, so i had my eyes checked. They weren't terrible, but I thought I would give my glasses a try to see if it helped. It didn't. I went on FMLA, never thinking I would have to go through what I went through. After 41 days in the hospital, undergoing a multitude of tests, plasma exchanges, testing for Lyme disease, I went to the rehab inpatient for 7 weeks. I had 4 sets of serial casts, fitted for my braces which I continue to wear everyday thanks to my father. I am finally in outpatient therapy and I should be happy as I am making some progress but negativity around me drags me down. I love my mother and my brother and sister but it seems I am never doing enough for myself. They don't understand that if I could do it I would be. I have started standing at the parallel bars, my knees pay for it later,but they aren't hurting in that moment. I got up on all fours,never thought I would be so happy to be on my knees but I could do it.. and that is what matters. I am focused on getting my legs strong enough to stand. Hoping for some solutions when I have my doctors appointments this week."

I have been researching and I am considering getting a wheelchair or a walker to help me get around. I am trying to stay positive, I am grateful for my family, my friends and my therapists. They all tell me that I am a fighter, but some days I just want to give up. I am scared, I am scared of what is going to happen next. I am scared of not being able to do the things I love, or the things that I take for granted every day. I am scared of being a burden on my family, of not being able to take care of myself. But I know I have to keep fighting, for myself, for my family and for my future. I will do whatever it takes to get better, to get back to my old self. I am determined to beat this, to overcome this, to survive this."
