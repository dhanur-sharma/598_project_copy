        "Summarize the following story in first person: In a few days, it will be five months since I lost my dream job. This was the job I worked towards my entire career as a chemist. As an investor funded company, I knew it could end at any time, but the company had just received the promise of another two years of funding. Our research was going well and we were meeting deadlines. The day that changed my life started as any other day at work. I was told there would be an impromptu meeting at the end of the day but that wasn't anything out of the norm. Unfortunately, I could not stay for the meeting as my 4 year old had swim practice on Wednesday evenings and I came in early to be able to take her. Everyone in that meeting was told to pack up their desks that evening and not to return. The funding that was promised was not going to happen and they could not afford to keep the staff for one more day. Since I was not at the meeting, I received my news by phone call, while sitting in the parking lot of the local rec center. I was told by HR to return the following day to collect my belongings and that there would be no severance package. It was so devastating of a loss that I could not focus on the task at hand of taking my daughter in for her lesson. The rest of the evening feels like a blur of events. All I can remember is going through the motions to make it to bedtime and getting on my computer to scour job postings. However, the city I live in is far more technology oriented and there were very few science oriented job postings. I started to become depressed and worried about our livelihood. I had only been with the company for a few months and already changed our lives for this job. I switched my daughter's preschool to be closer to my work and it was now a 30 minute commute from our home, with a few months left of the school year. I had also booked a cruise vacation with the extra income this job was providing and felt stressed about making the payments with only one income. The friends I made with my new co-workers were still too new that I didn't have a single one of them on social media. I also wasn't there for the final meeting and that left me without a means of gaining their contact information. I grieved for their loss as well. I knew the hardships a few of my single co-workers were going through and felt lucky that I had my husband to fall back on. This loss was one of the hardest I've encountered but it also brought about such wonderful change. I switched careers to substitute teaching and not being in a lab meant it was safe to have another baby."
