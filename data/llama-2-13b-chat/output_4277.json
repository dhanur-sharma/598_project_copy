        "Summarize the following story in first person: Earlier on in the year, my girlfriend and her family invited me to go on a trip with them. We would be going to South Texas to float on fish on a river, and do some camping for several days. My girlfriend and I are in a long distance relationship, so I take every opportunity that I can to see her. We planned the trip for several months, and brainstormed many different places in Texas to go for the trip. For a while, we were going to go to a local lake, but decided that it was a little bit too primitive. For a while, we also thought that we would all be in tents, but eventually we sourced a camper from a family friend, and we thought it would be fun for all of us to stay in it together. Finally, after a few months of planning, we decided on a pretty nice campground along a river south west of San Antonio. We had heard great things about this place, so we made up our minds pretty quickly. We got their on a Thursday night (I drove alone, as I live in a different city from my girlfriend and her family) and we set up the camper. It was really hot, around 99 degrees, but once the sun went down it was not so bad. One of the things I remember most fondly about this trip was actually falling asleep next to my girlfriend that first night we got to the campground. Since we do not live together, sleeping together is really special for us. Obviously though, we didn't do anything much more than some kissing, because we were sharing the camper with other people. Over the next few days we did a lot of really fun activities. We rented some kayaks from a local man, and we went up and down the river in them. The water was super clear, and the scenery was just beautiful. At night, we had a campfire, drank beer, told jokes, and just enjoyed each other's company. Looking back, the thing I remember most about the trip was just being able to spend time with my girlfriend, and not necessarily what we did on our tip."
