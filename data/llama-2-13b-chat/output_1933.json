        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 3 months my daughter and I were driving to the grocery store. This was on a small residential road near our house where the speed limit is only 35 miles per hour. As we were stopped at a stop sign, a car unexpectedly slammed into the back of our car. I was shocked and turned to be sure my daughter was okay when out of the corner of my eye, I saw the other car backing away from our car and then speeding off down the road! I was too surprised to make note of many details of the car, and certainly not make note of the license plate or any very identifying information. I was able to note the color and general style of the car (a sedan) but couldn't recall anything about the driver or the make or model of the car. After I confirmed my daughter was physically okay but just scared, I pulled our car to the side of the road and comforted her. A nearby resident who had heard the collision came out and checked on us. She offered to call the police while I comforted my child and assessed the damage. When the police showed up, they asked for all the details I could recall about the other car and said they'd look. They checked the damage on my car to try to see if there were any clues that would help them identify the other vehicle. They told me to call my insurance company and an agent came to the scene. The police didn't seem overly invested in actually solving the crime and said they'd get back to me if they had any info but I have had to call them for updates periodically as no one ever reaches out to me. I guess it'll never be solved most likely. Thankfully, my insurance was great about getting my car fixed even though these things are always a hassle. I guess I'm mostly just thankful that neither of us were injured and that the car was drivable and not totaled. This situation has made me aware that bad things can happen at any time and we really need to appreciate each day we are given because you truly just never know what's to come."
