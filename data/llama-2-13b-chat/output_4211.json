        "Summarize the following story in first person: My family, and aunt in particular, experienced immense and sudden loss a few years ago. My aunt was trying the best she could to deal with her grief but had a mental break due to the stress. This was actually the best thing that could have happened to her. My aunt lost her only child tragically and suddenly a few years ago after losing her mother (my grandmother) 4 months before. She thought she was dealing with her grief and she probably was the best way she could at that time, but she really was not. She let grief take her over. It was extremely painful for me and our other family members to witness this. At one point she hit rock bottom and had a complete mental break. This ended up being the best thing for her and made her realize that she wasn't and hadn't been dealing with her grief. So she started making steps to start dealing with her grief and emotions surrounding my cousin's death. She seems to be on the mend now, but I still remain cautiously optimistic. She has made herself more stable both emotionally and physically and is taking good risks now. She is showing a bravery that I knew she had in her all along, she had just allowed the grief to take over. I was very close to my cousin. We were only 18 months apart and she was my only female cousin on both sides of the family. The loss of her hit me very hard as well and I tried very hard to not let grief take me over. Grief changed me. I'm not the same person and I don't necessarily have the same outlook on life anymore but I realize how difficult it can be to fight grief from overtaking you after such heavy losses and I'm so proud of my aunt for clawing her way back and starting to live her life again."
