        "Summarize the following story in first person: I have a crazy story to tell I think you might like. It happened a couple weeks ago but I can not stop forgetting about it. I was hanging out with some of my girlfriends, and we all have kids. We planned a day where all mommies got together with our kids. It was a birthday party for one of the girls kids. He was turing 9 and they rented a huge waterslide for all the kids. After all the kids got to party on it for a few hours, we (as in the adults) took it over. We had some beer and we were going down, pushing each other down. It really was so fun. I was pushed down by one of my friends and I landed on my arm wrong and twisted my shoulder. It still hurts to this day! Im so mad at her, but she is my best friend. It was a crazy night, a fun day. The kids had so much fun at the party. We will always be friends and do stuff together."
