        "Summarize the following story in first person: Things were pretty hectic a few months ago with my friend Julie. Though she was only halfway through her pregnancy, she was experiencing some pain and doctors couldn't figure it out. After a few weeks of dealing with it by using pain medication, her condition did not begin to improve. I was starting to get extremely worried. I could only think of my old college roommate, Kim, who went through something similar and ended up losing her child after only a few months. Though I spoke with Julie to reassure her, I remained scared at the possibility of something seriously bad happening. Then, one afternoon maybe five months ago, I received a text from her husband that nearly put me in shock. He said that she was forced into labor early and both her and the baby were on life support. This was the worst news I could have ever imagined. My jaw was on the floor. I wasn't sure what I should do. I called her husband again but he did not answer. That's when I really started to panic. So I rushed to my car and headed straight for the hospital, despite living nearly three hours away. Somehow, by a complete miracle, I received a call when I was roughly 20 minutes away from the hospital. It was Julie's husband to tell me that both Julie and her baby were off life support and were going to be just fine. I felt so relieved! I was able to spend a few hours with them and see the baby, and then prepared to head back home for my three hour journey. What a day!"
