        "Summarize the following story in first person: I got proposed to at Disney World. We are from Houston and he flew me to Orlando Florida and proposed. My sisters and brother in law went too. It was my first time ever going to Disney World and that made it so much more memorable.  He proposed at the end of the day, when the fireworks were going off. We were all pretty tired and honestly I wasn't expecting it at all. It is still one of the best days of my life. It was perfect and the most romantic thing he has ever done for me. Soon we will be getting married. Our wedding date is 11. 23.2019, and we have been planning like crazy. Actually our theme is Happily ever after, we tried incorporating Disney in it. Overall it has been a very stressful but happy event. It has been very expensive, but super fun to plan. We are a month and three days away. But im sure it will be well worth it."
