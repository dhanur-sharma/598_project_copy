        "Summarize the following story in first person: 2 months ago i was barely scraping by financially. i was making just enough money at work to pay my bills and eat, but not much else. i didn't even have the ability to put money away in case something bad were to happen to me. if i got sick and was unable to work, everything would have been over for me. but as luck would have it i actually got a raise in my pay. and no small raise either. i was put on as head of a major project at work and was compensated accordingly. i remember when the news broke about me being placed on the project, i went home and just cried tears of joy because it felt like my career was finally going where i wanted it to go. i called my parents and gave them the good news. they were excited for me because they knew how much it meant to me. they were also happy i was finally being paid like i deserved to be. as soon as i got my first check since becoming the project head i took the money and paid off all my remaining debt. i even had some left over to put into savings. i felt like i didn't have to compromise in my career to earn good money. i was proud of myself more than i had ever been before."
