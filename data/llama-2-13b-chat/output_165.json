        "Summarize the following story in first person: I applied for a job that was more about the special needs of children. It was actually crazy because I did not have the expertise in the field. It may have sounded simple at first because on paper, the job description is entirely doable. When I say doable, what I mean by that is that I can definitely improvise my own experience and apply it to the job. So that day, I went ahead and got the interview. I prepared my lucky casual attire, which was a maroon colored sleeved shirt. I call it the lucky casual attire because it was simply a lucky shirt that I wear for interviews and everytime I wear it, I become successful in being offered the job. When I did the interview, I was not doing well with it. I was stupid enough and actually cocky enough to not be able to even try and prepare for the interview. My thoughts after I did the interview was mostly negative, I was hard on myself for not trying to prepare for the interview. I promised myself that that interview would be the last one that I did not come prepared. The interviewee was actually a good mix between accomodating and genuinely strict. The interviewee was actually attractive too. The moment the interview was done, the interviewee still ended up offering me the job, on the spot. I was excited inside and obviously I definitely accepted the job gratefully."
