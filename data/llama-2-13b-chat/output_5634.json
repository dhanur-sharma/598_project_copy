        "Summarize the following story in first person: It started as an ordinary morning for me during a recent traveling vacation I took through Canada. I had awoken early, had breakfast at the motel and then drove downtown to visit an art museum I had been planning to see. I arrived early and was one of the first ones to enter. I noticed five other people waiting, two couples, one in their 50s the other couple younger, perhaps in thier 30s. There was also an older woman, she looked like she could be in her 80s. She wore a coat although it wasn't that cold out and walked with a distinctive wooden cane. The two couple went in as soon as the doors were unlocked and I held the door for the older woman to enter. The museum had a special showing of photographs from famous artist in Canada. I took my time walking through and viewing the work. On the third floor I noticed the old woman standing in front of two photographs by a woman photographer (I'll leave her name out) and I smiled at her as I passed behind the old woman and glanced at the photographers name and saw there were two photos of her work. I continued on and then went to the basement cafe for some coffee and a pastry. I was there about 30 minutes. I decided to walk through the museum again. On the third floor I noticed the old woman still standing in the same place. I approached her and after making eye contact, I ask her if she was OK?\"Oh yes, quite,\" she said, \"I'm just admiring my granddaughter's photographs.\"\"Oh, this photograph is your granddaughter?\" I asked.\"She was,\" said the old woman, \"but I'm afraid she died three years ago, an accident, she was 37.\"I told her how terribly sorry I was and then she told me she's lived in that town, but her granddaughter worked in Montreal,  so she only saw her every few years. But now she had come for eight days in a row and would continue to come into the work was moved to another city as it made her feel closer to her granddaughter than she had ever been. i complimented the work and invited the old woman down to the cafe for coffee. She talked to me for an hour about her life, but mostly of her daughter (who also had died) and her granddaughter."

I listened and sipped my coffee and we chatted for an hour before she said she had to go. I walked her to the door and we hugged before she left. As I watched her leave, I felt tears welling up in my eyes. I realized that the woman had been coming to the museum for eight days in a row to see her granddaughter's work and talk to her, even though her granddaughter had been gone for three years. I had been so caught up in my own travels and plans that I had forgotten how important it is to hold on to the memories of loved ones, no matter how difficult it may be. I felt grateful for the opportunity to listen to the old woman's story and to be reminded of the importance of cherishing the memories of those we love."
