        "Summarize the following story in first person: In the morning I decided that it was my job to give this kitten a home. I really want to keep it, but I work up to ten hours a day so that wouldn't be fair to the kitten. The first step was to take it to the vet.  I knew there would be vaccinations and a de-worming involved. I figured I would ask the vet who could help me find the little guy a home. At the vet, I sat in the lobby with a few other people. The kitten was nice and warm in my hoodie. An older lady was there, looking tearful at the desk. I did some eavesdropping and figured out that she had just put her older cat down. A light bulb moment. I didn't waste any time thinking about whether or not this was a good  idea. Before I could tell myself to mind my own business I said, \"ma'am are you interested in adopting a kitten?\" She wiped her eyes and looked at me cautiously. I pulled the little kitten out of my sweatshirt and she couldn't help but \"awwwwwww. poor little guy.\" I knew she was the one. Maybe there was a higher power who put us together that day. I gave her the kitten after his examination and the woman had tears of happiness in her eyes when I said goodbye."
