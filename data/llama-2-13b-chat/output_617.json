        "Summarize the following story in first person: I'm thinking a lot about my older sister these past few months. Last October, she lost her husband to a long battle with pancreatic cancer. He was only 57 and had been suffering for three and a half years. The came six months after our Dad had passed from complications due to a stroke. This summer was particularly challenging for my sister as my Dad's birthday and her anniversary was in July so she was very sad. When I called my sister on her anniversary to let her know I was thinking of her, she told me she had not even heard from our mother was very hurt by that as our mother, out of everyone, should have known how my sister was feeling that day. Whenever I would speak to my sister, she would be upset about something our mother had said to her. For example, in trying to go through paperwork, my mother would say to her, \"at least you have your girls to help, I have no one\". It's hard for me to even think our mother could be so harsh because my sister's husband died so young whereas my dad was in his 80's and had lived a great life. This insenstivity extended to our younger sister, who instead of offering her support, chose to bring up an event that happening 8 years ago at our parent's 50th anniversary. It escalated earlier this summer over text messages with some very vile things said to each other and they are no longer speaking to each other. In fact, my younger sister tried to get me to take her side when I went for a visit for her son's graduation. Thankfully, my younger sister's husband told her that she should not drag other people into her fight with my older sister. It was heartbreaking to her that our mother and younger sister are that insensitive to my older sister and what she is going through. This made me want to make a point of reaching out more regularly to my sister to check in to see how she is doing."
