        "Summarize the following story in first person: Within the last few months I created a true account of something that is happening in my life that I posted on Reddit in one of the chat threads. Because of this post my inbox blew up with messages of support, offers to date me, illicit offers, and even offers of friendship.  I actually started corresponding with several of the people who sent me messages and I even went on to meet one of the writers within my metro area in a public setting.  We actually went on several dates and meetings, and they tried very hard to have me give them my address or have them pick me up at work but I would not allow this.  I try not to every do that until I feel as if I've gotten to know the person which for me, usually takes at least 3 months or more. While this person seemed nice, and true they were not.  Over the course of several weeks of dates, and meetings, I discovered that everything they said was a lie.  Who they were, where they worked, the family they had.  All lies. This person was attempting to prey upon me due to the story that I put out in a public setting. It was disheartening to discover this but in reality it opened my eyes that virtual friends, interchanges, etc., are truly not real or actual.  The internet is a very dangerous place and one should not venture there alone or without friends.  I have truly learned my lesson and will be extra cautious when posting on public chats and make sure that all of my personal information is safeguarded.  In this day and age you should never trust anyone no matter how kind or nice you are, and no matter how kind and nice they seem.   This was a very valuable lesson that I learned."
