        "Summarize the following story in first person: Exactly three months ago today, I had the worst experience of my life.  I could not eat without vomiting.  I could not sleep for the pain.  I was in desperate need of a doctor but didn't have health insurance.  I waited as long as I could and finally when my eyes began turning yellow and my skin a yellowish orange color, I decided it was time to go to the emergency room.  I was concerned of how I would pay for a visit but I knew something was wrong.  It was almost like I could feel death approaching me.  When I came into the emergency department, I was immediately triaged and when the doctor examined me, his first words to the nurse was, \"Book an OR, stat!\".  That was scary but at that point I was a the mercy of the physicians.  I prayed to God, asking for his protection.  Ten minutes later, I was under anesthesia, grasping at life.  The initial surgery took 2 hours and the second surgery took 11 hours.   In recovery, the doctor explained to me that I had to be opened up and fixed.  My gallbladder had gall stones and those gall stones had acted like bullets inside my body when my gallbladder had burst open.  The gallstones tore through my pancreas, liver, and right kidney.  They had to go in and do some repairs.  While the ordeal was traumatic and scary, it is a constant reminder that in a blink of an eye, I could have been 6 feet under right now.  I am thankful I went to the hospital when I did.  I am still unsure how to pay for the $800,000 bill, but I suppose that is the cost of my life.  Today I am a healthy 39 year old female who has an incredible deep red and ugly abdominal scar, but has the hope of a future."
