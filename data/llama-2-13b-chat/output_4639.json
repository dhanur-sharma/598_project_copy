        "Summarize the following story in first person: Growing up with my family was quite hard. My parents were extremely religious and hated homosexuality. This made it extremely difficult living in their household because I am a lesbian. I always worried about what they would do if they found out. I still haven't told them because of how they act. They probably would never speak to me again. That's what they did to my grandfather, anyway.  Before he died, it was found out that he had a relationship with a fellow sailor while serving in the Navy. My family kept it very secret, and I only heard them talk about it in private once or twice. They were disgusted by him and were worried his actions would affect their standing in the church. They were so upset that they didn't talk to him for the last few months of his life. Last weekend my grandfather passed away. My mother didn't even show up to his funeral. I wonder how they could be so heartless, especially to their own family members. It makes me really sad that they've closed themselves off from the world so much. I hope I can tell them eventually about myself. I hope that I could change their opinions about it and show them that love is love."
