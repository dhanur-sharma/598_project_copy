I had to go to the hospital. The morphine they gave me helped a ton. I was in pain for a week. My family came over to say they were sorry for kicking me out. I forgave them. They all had a big cry together. The food at the hospital wasn't too bad. I got a nice steak one day. I also had some french fries with my steak. They were both decent. They gave me a choice between apple juice or soda. I decided on soda. I left the hospital after two weeks. The bills were paid for by my insurance."
