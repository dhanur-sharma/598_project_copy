I was thrilled when my brother in law Paul told me that he had a spare ticket for a coldplay concert. This was 3 weeks ago. I still remember jumping up and down with joy. The past few months were quite hard with me losing my job and all. So i really needed this. It has been a desire of mine for years, to watch their concert up close. I finally got to it. It was magical! So many of favorite songs! I even managed to get selfies with a couple of band members. This experience infused a fresh supply of energy in me that i so badly needed."
