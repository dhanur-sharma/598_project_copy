        "Summarize the following story in first person: Five months ago, at the age of 63, i retired.  This was an extremely important event; something i had looked forward to for quite a long time.  After working in social service fields for approximately  thirty years i was definitely \"burned out.\"  I had been a caseworker at the local Department of Social Services for a little over fourteen years.  Then i spent approximately the same amount of time as a counselor working at a non profit agency.  There are some who believe that this field of employment; working with all types of people who need a variety of services, is the number one field for burnout.  whether or not this is true, i can honestly say that when i had the chance to retire, i knew it was the right time.  The fact is that i had planned on working until i was 65 but i really needed to \"get out.\"  I had lost a lot of my patience; little things were beginning to annoy me, and worst of all i didn't feel as if i was giving the clients my best efforts.  I can truly say that i am now the happiest I have ever been.  Not only am i retired, but i spend four days a week with my wonderful two year old granddaughter.  My wife runs a small day care center here in our house, so Kinsley comes over here four days a week and there is no way i can describe how much I adore her.  She is our first grandchild; i had no idea how much i was going to enjoy my time with her.  She seems to learn something new almost every day.  The fact that i am retired means that i am on my own schedule and can spend as much time with Kinsley as i want.  Things are so good with my life right now that it's almost too good to be true.   What made my retirement so emotional was that i knew it was something I really needed emotionally.  I knew it was the right time to stop working.  Spending so much time now with my granddaughter makes it all even better."
