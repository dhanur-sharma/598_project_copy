        "Summarize the following story in first person: Dear Diary,I am so excited to announce that 2 weeks ago I was given a raise! I have been working with and reporting to regular donors at the school and because of the donations that they have given the school felt like my work warranted a raise! This money is really going to make a difference as I have had trouble making enough to pay for this apartment. My first paycheck with the pay raise should be here tomorrow and I plan to go out to treat myself to a nice dinner to celebrate. I think maybe Ill go to that new taco place that opened across the street. Moving forward I know that great things are going to happen. Over that last year things have been really hard since Michael left. I feel like all I could do was to dig into work and forget about my home life. Perhaps I haven't dealt with things as well as I should have. Is work all that I think about? Damn him... Even now when something great happens I second guess my happiness. I should go to that therapist mom recommended, insurance will pay for it. Tomorrow Ill start painting again. Ive been to into loss and work to remember what makes me happy. I was going to be a portrait artist. Now my portfolio is covered in dust. The brushes I didn't bother cleaning because I was going to use them again tomorrow are now dried and useless. But thats yesterday. I can still start anew."
