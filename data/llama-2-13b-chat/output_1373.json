        "Summarize the following story in first person: My family and I traveled to our son's school downstate to attend his graduation ceremony from Corpsman School 5 months ago. This was a proud moment for our family, and it was a long journey to get here for our family. It was culmination of years of hard work and dedication from my son and support from us that got him here. I could not have been proud of him if I tried.  So, to make sure we were there to see our son's achievement live, my wife and i took five days off work to ensure that we would be there and to account for any unexpected events. My wife and I would soon find out how useful those extra days would be. First, the rip to the school grounds went a lot slower than we anticipated due to flooding and storms in the area a few days prior. This made road leading downstate to be backed up with traffic and filled with detours that took longer routes. While annoying, the commute was the least for the issues as we would should learn later. Once arriving at the school grounds, we greeted our son and talked to him before we headed to our hotel were we would be staying for two days. When we got to our hotel, we discovered that the hotel was nearly as clean and neat as they advertised.  We weren't pleases, but we were tough old birds and tolerated it. On the day of the graduation ceremony, one last time had to present itself to make this trip as much of a headache as possible. We woke up late because the alarm clock in our room didn't work. So, when we left out to go to the school to be seated, we were already a half-hour. that half-hour made all the difference since finding a parking spot in the school's parking lot was a huge pain. We spent a good 20 minutes trying to a spot--any spot!--to park. By the time we finally found a spot, we only had 10 minutes to get into the building where the ceremony was being held before it started. Thankfully, I remembered were our seating was since I scooted the place with my son the day prior, so we were able to find our seating literally moment before the ceremony started."
