        "Summarize the following story in first person: My wife and I have been living in the same family home for the last ten years.  It was our first family home and we purchased it when we were newlyweds.  Now that our children are growing up, we needed more bedrooms.  We tried to make the current situation work as we are very attached to this first house.  It was a difficult decision, but after much deliberation we decided to sell it.  This happened about four months ago.  We are excited about the new house we are moving into but miss the nostalgic touches of where we reared our children in their younger days.  We miss the apple tree outside that we planted ourselves when we first moved in.  We miss the marks on the wall where we recorded their height as they grew up.  But we try and look forward to the new memories we will be creating in this new home and set our sights on the future.  This house has a dining nook where we can imagine many family pizza and movie nights going forward.  It also has a fire pit that we can imagine the kids will enjoy having their friends over at as they grow older.  It is important to never grow to attached to worldly things as nothing lasts.  It is also important to remember that although nothing lasts, nothing is lost.  The older I grow the more I realize what this truly means to me."
