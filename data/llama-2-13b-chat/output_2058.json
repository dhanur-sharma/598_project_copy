        "Summarize the following story in first person: I have been writing and performing standup comedy for three, nearly four years. There have been times where I\u2019ve done okay, times where I\u2019ve had an audience of three, and times where I\u2019ve had a full house with uproars of laughter at every punchline. About five months ago, I competed in a stand up comedy night in which comedians were awarded based on audience votes. After a night of 14 talented comedians performing, I won audience favorite comedian and as a result, a handsome cash reward. I felt so much adrenaline and esteem from this experience. Some of my closest friends made the trip to see my performance about an hour and a half from our home. I had my favorite people with me and I was so joyful and excited. I had never felt quite this way before. Audience members were constantly approaching me and praising me for my performance. Some told me I inspired them and some told me they really identified with my style of comedy. They appreciated the work they knew and understood must have gone in to writing and practicing my set. I felt so rewarded by my emotions and the cash prize was simply a bonus. I still keep a twenty from that cash prize as a reminder that what I do is worthwhile. It can be hard pouring your soul out in my style of comedy. It\u2019s emotional and requires an unprecedented level of vulnerability and genuine personality. I\u2019ll never forget the emotions or some of the things people said to me that night. I was so nervous as the night started by confidence began to grow and wane as the night went on. I\u2019m so proud of what I do and why I do it."
