        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was always making excuses not to go back to school and complete my Masters degree. Before long over 20 years passed and I realized something was missing, I wanted a Masters degree, it never left my mind. The opportunity was present and I am so glad I finally took it. But what really matters on this special day is not only proving to myself I could do it, but showing my Daughter to never give up. The pride I feel inside from accomplishing my goal, but the feeling of completeness there is from my Daughter receiving her Masters the same day is indescribable. I remember what started me on this quest, my parents wanted me to be \"educated\" and in their eyes it meant a Masters degree. The told me continuously to start classes, to get moving on it, at times there were almost relentless about it. I could see it in their eyes, how very much they wanted me to complete my education, I felt that drive in them, that sense of pride they would have in me. Before they passed away I made a promise, to me I took an oath in their presence, that I would no matter what complete my Masters degree. They never let me forget that promise, my mother reminded me of it daily, my father talked about it often and I carried that around with me until this day. I remember sharing the story with my Daughter, the promise I made to her grandparents and what it meant to them and me. At first she could not grasp the meaning of it all to me, the sense of gratitude I had for my parents as well as what it meant to them for me to get my higher level degree. I finally got through to my daughter about how I felt, how my parents felt and how to me it tied in with her getting her Masters on the same day. She always knew how I beam with pride over her, all her accomplishments and dedication to studying. It brought me great happiness to be able to share the day with her, to get a degree the same time she did. I feel inside now a true sense of calm, knowing my family is proud of me, I set a good example for my daughter and my parents can rest. I told my daughter my life is finally complete, and I feel a true sense of circle and self, and that my parents can finally rest in peace with an oath kept."
