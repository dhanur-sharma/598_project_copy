        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was working on mturk for pennies as I do everyday. My life was in a horrible downward spiral that I cant seem to stop. I'm watching the democratic debate and hoping that maybe the country will be able to turn itself around but I knew it wont happen because we are all slaves for corporations. Then I hear banging on my bedroom door and I put my laptop down and go to answer the door. I open the door and my is extremely drunk and slurs the words in his pidgeon \"Did you break into my room\". I answered no and the he says \" You didn't break into my room?\" I said I wouldn't do that. He the sucker punched me in the eye. I fell back onto the floor hurting my bad back severely. He keeps shouting to get the fuck up and I said I'll just stay here as I hold my hand over my eye. The woman who owns the house comes out of her room and asks what the hell is he doing? He states that I broke into his room and stole some money. She then makes me come out of my room to talk about what happened. I told her I didn't steal his money or go into his room. He then tells her we used to be such great friends and that he had told me where he hides his money and I said bullshit you fucking liar. She asks him if I wasn't there would he have attacked her and of course he said no. So I said to call the cops and he then changed his tune and started apologizing. I said get the fuck away from me and the owner did nothing to him other than say it isn't ok  to attack people in the house. Now I live in fear and constantly look for a new place to live."
