        "Summarize the following story in first person: My extended family from Hawaii came over to celebrate some birthdays. My cousin and grandfather have the same birthday. Myself and my two brothers are all born in the same month. This always makes celebrating easy, but a big event. This year we decided to go to an amusement park. I've been there before, but most of my family hadn't been there in years. Even so, I knew we would all have a great time. As it turned out, some of us had a little bit too much of a good time! My cousin has always been kind of a problem drinker and we all hoped he would control himself this time. This was not the case. The day started out great. A lot of catching up and laughs. It was around lunch time and we all decided to get something to eat. A few others had a drink, nothing unusual, but my cousin went overboard. For the rest of the day he was very loud and even got kicked off one of the rides. We still had a lot of fun and made some great memories."
