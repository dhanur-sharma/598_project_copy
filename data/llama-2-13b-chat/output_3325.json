        "Summarize the following story in first person: About three weeks ago, I took my niece to Target to buy her a  couple toys. We don't get to hang out very often, so I always make sure to buy her stuff when we do. I picked up her up from my sister's house, and we went to the outlets. We went inside, looked around at the toys, and she picked out a couple she wanted. We then went to the electronics department. She somehow talked me into buying her a tv for her room. The lady thought my niece was so cute that she gave us a coupon on the TV and saved me 80 dollars on the whole order. Afterwards, we went to get ice cream at a local spot. I got her a big sundae and some coconut almond ice cream for myself. When I was paying, the owner of the spot complimented my niece and again, we got a discount. Her's was free, mine was half off. We then just drove around and talked for a bit, deciding on what to do next. We went to the pet store to look at the puppies. She was in love with all of them and begged me to buy her one, but I knew my sister would kill me if I did. After we had some fun there, we went to get some dinner at Red Robin. She got a small kids meal with pizza, and I got a big bacon burger. We weren't going to get dessert because she already had ice cream, but after we were eating, the waitress brought out my niece an ice cream for free, just out of no where.  I let her eat it, of course, but told her not to tell her mom. We went back to my house to play with my dog and cats for a while, and she had a blast. We had a great day together. It was just very fun and even though I spent more than I thought I was going to, because of her being cute, I saved a good bit of money."
