        "Summarize the following story in first person: When we brought the dog home, my kids were so excited. They were in love with her. But of course like everything my kids got bored after a couple months. Of course we still have the dog and I love her with all my heart, she is now my baby and we are like best friends. We hang out and if the kids try to mess with me she protects me. The kids still like the dog but not as much. Like they are not so excited to take her for a walk or feed her or pick up after her if she had an accident on the floor. This has def. been an adjustment for our family. I really like having a dog around for the times when everyone is asleep or the first thing in the morning before anyone is awake. Its like a happy face addition to our family. She really is a shining star in my life. I tried to cut her nails myself once and it turned out to be a nightmare. I will never do that again, the dog freaked out and I freaked out. I like to take her to my best friend, she is a professional groomer. She is a little expensive but she is worth every penny as long as I dont have to do it again."
