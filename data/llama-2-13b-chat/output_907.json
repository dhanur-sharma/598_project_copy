        "Summarize the following story in first person: Dear Diary, What is happening to my life? I feel like I\u2019m on another planet. Or, maybe I wish I was. Courtney won\u2019t speak to me at all. For the last two months I have been losing sleep over trying to figure out what I could have done wrong. Who just suddenly stops talking to their best friend out of nowhere with no explanation whatsoever? Am I that bad of a friend? I\u2019m angry. I don\u2019t deserve this. I didn\u2019t do anything. Maybe she\u2019s a bad friend. Maybe I don\u2019t need her. She has done horrible things to me and I forgave her every time. She didn\u2019t come to dads funeral. She stole my boyfriend. She blew me off repeatedly because of some guy she was seeing. Still though, I moved past that, and if she can\u2019t move past whatever it is that I did (if it\u2019s anything at all), then maybe she\u2019s not worth my friendship. What she is doing is wrong. Childish. She could at least talk to me and tell me what I did. But I guess I\u2019m not worth her time and I don\u2019t deserve an explanation. Whatever it is, I hope it\u2019s worth losing a five year friendship over. I\u2019m not apologizing if I don\u2019t even know what I did. If she wants to talk, she can come to me. Until then, I will be living my life as if she doesn\u2019t exist."
