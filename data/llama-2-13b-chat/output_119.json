        "Summarize the following story in first person: Walking through the small apartment, Celia had a huge smile, trying to hide a bit or nervousness, to show me her or now our apartment.  We had spent some time together, but not much as we lived so far away and I decided to move in with her never having even been to her place.  Around each corner she pointed out a room with little suggestions for what we would do in them.  She had an adorable way of showing the room where she would have both hands in the back pockets of her jeans or one and one arm embracing me, while she lifted up on her toes just a bit as she ended her sentences.  There was such joy in the air to finally be coming together and thinking of the possibilities that this flat would bring. This was not only me moving in with my partner, but this is the first partner I fully moved in with.  All my other relationships had stages where we would spend 12 or 14 days together or spend the night 5-10x in a row at the same place, but I never got to the stage where we were moved in and officially living together.  Not only was I making a big jump in my relationship, I was making a big jump in where I lived.   I moved away from my friends and family to live with Celia.  I did not know anyone in the city or region she lived in.  She is just so wonderful that I had to make this big change and take a chance on the love between us.  Later on that day, she would chop up a salad for us to have for dinner.  That was a big deal as her old roommate told me that was a surprise that she \"cooked\" so much for me.  It was a wonderful little meal and a sign of her trying to help me ease into the situation.  Washing the dishes it really was settling in that I was in a new place that was beginning to feel like a home.  After that we had our first Netflix and chill.  We found a BBC series that we became completely addicted to.  There while she was leaning up against to me the whole film as we found our little comfort spot on her small couch.  There were no nerves then, except not to spill the wine.  With her cat climbing over us, I was realizing that this was a place I would be for along time.  While her head rested on my chest and she started to fade into sleep, I had found that comfort zone in the apartment very quickly."
