        "Summarize the following story in first person: My kids have never been more than a state away from home. I figured it was wrong of me to not take them on vacation at least once every couple years or so. I have so many good memories of vacations as a kid, so I wanted them to make memories as well. I decided to take them to Florida to visit my dad and step mom about 3 months ago. Normally they come visit us, so this was a surprise for them. I booked our tickets and we left the next week. The kids were so excited to go on an airplane, which was a relief. I thought they would be scared. When we got to Florida, all they could talk about was Disney World. I told them we weren't going there and we were just visiting family and going sight-seeing. Little did they know, I had bought tickets for the whole family. When we got to my dad's house, we all had a big dinner and dessert. When we were done eating, I went around the table and gave each of them a ticket. My kids went crazy. My dad told me there's no way he wasn't going to pay me back for these considering how expensive they were. Honestly, I was expecting that, as well as hoping for that. We all had an amazing time for about 10 hours. Then we went home."
