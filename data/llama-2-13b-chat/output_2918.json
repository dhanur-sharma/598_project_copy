        "Summarize the following story in first person: Two years ago I graduated from a prestigious school with a master degree in which I worked very hard for several years on. It was very expensive as well and I see a long road ahead as I try to work and pay off student debt. The school was a place where I had wanted to go for several years before graduating high school but wasn't able to secure a scholarship to pay for it. I struggled a lot with myself and the school to try and pay my way through it. It was a difficult time and I was very unhappy with the way things were going. At the time of graduation, I decided not to walk with the rest of my class on that day because I was so upset thinking of the future and what was to come next. As I think back now, I regret that decision very much. I should have walked with the people I had grown close to. The students, the teachers and for everyone who supported me during that time. I am sure that I let a lot of people down because of it. Now that I'm out of college, I wish I would go back and do it again, just to walk with them and celebrate this achievement which I spent so much time and money doing. You can only do it once, and I should have done it. I should have looked past my emotions at the time and thought about the future and realized I would not feel this way forever. It was a temporary state and I would regret it later in life. It's unfortunate that this happened, but I will have to live with it forever now. I would give anything to go back and change it."
