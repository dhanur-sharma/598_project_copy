        "Summarize the following story in first person: I went to one of my good friends wedding and she was breath taking and this was my first time taking pictures at the wedding. I think I done a great job it was a very emotional day and a lot of crying but I think my pictures showed great emotions in that day. Her husband was so happy when she came down the isal and it was so sweet. It was a very long day but a very well worth it day. I took a lot of very nice pictures of her and him together and of there family together. I love the part of them coming out of the church. They really showed of they felt after they go married. They had a wonderful ceremony after the wedding and there was a lot of food and dancing. They don't the flower toss and they cut the cake a feed each other. she was even given a house to live it and that showed a lot of emotions to. With me telling the story I think if I could show pictures it would show you more emotions. They got to go in a old jeep and that was kind of neat seeing them leave on that jeep. They even made sure to wave at everybody and we started cleaning up once they left. This was one of the pretest wedding I have been to in a wail. They had everything perfect even though I thought we were going to be a little late with pictures. They even had this at a church with a pond. They knew exactly what they wanted and how they wanted this and so we were justing waiting on some of the grooms men. Some of them where running late and I was trying not to be unhappy but I was get scared like I wasn't having enough time to do all the pictures. This is the end of my story but like I was saying if I could show pictures I could show a whole lot more."
