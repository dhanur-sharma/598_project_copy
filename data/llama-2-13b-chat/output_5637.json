        "Summarize the following story in first person: One day four months ago, my eyes opened to the California sun in my face through my venetian blinds, little dust particles scattering before my waking consciousness. I was feeling good after a long run along the Santa Monica coastal path, and hour of yoga, and a nice Acai bowl before bed. It was a normal weekday, living off the interest of my well-invested exit cash from Snap's IPO, wondering which canyon I'd explore north of the Palisades. Altruistic good nature ebbed into my gathering self awareness, and I was compelled to do something good for someone else. I asked Siri, \"where can I donate blood?.\" A list of blood drives popped up, and I was happy to see there was one right up the street. I popped up out of bed, threw on my huaraches, pancho, and skinny jeans and hopped on my one wheel for the quick jaunt. I had never donated before, but I take good care of myself, so I wasn't surprised I passed the screening. Needles are scary, but I sucked it up for the good I was doing and this little deposit in the karma bank. I stood up to walk away, threw a shaka at the phlebotomist, and started one wheeling it home. Suddenly I lost consciousness and fell into the curb. I came to in a hospital bed, concussed, and with a broken arm. The doctor suggested I have an MRI. I don't feel good about cosmic rays penetrating my body! A bone was protruding through my skin. There was blood everywhere."
