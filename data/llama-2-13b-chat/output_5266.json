        "Summarize the following story in first person: My very first time performing at a show was such a mixed experience. A few months ago my cousin told me about a show that features a open mic segment for up incoming artist. I was hesitant to accept but he assure me that i would regret the decision to not participate and eased me into the thought of performing. I prepared for this the best i could in such shot notice. He picked me up that evening and we rode of to the venue. When I got there i felt rather underwhelmed by the presence and aura around the venue. I remember being rather confident almost borderline arrogant about my talent and abilities to entertain the crowd. I was talking myself up to the other artist present at the venue with looking back seemed like a cover for the underlying nervousness I felt. When I was finally called up I felt a release of a almost crippling anxiety build up inside of me. The more I approached the stage the worst the anxiety affected me until I finally hit the stage. That's when a feeling i can't quite describe came over me. I felt like I could do any thing and that I was on auto pilot a natural high of some sort. It was liberating something I want to feel over and over again. That rush has help me step into even more opportunity over the past few months. I think that was the single most pivotal moment for me this year."
