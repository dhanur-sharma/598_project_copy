        "Summarize the following story in first person: A couple weeks ago for July 4th, we went up to Hiawassee, Georgia, a small mountain town on the border of North Carolina and Georgia. My sister and I were visiting our grandparents to celebrate 4th of July together. Their house was situated on a quiet cove of a lake. This lake is generally what Hiawassee has come to be known for, as it is often covered in boats and recreations. Beautiful houses line the shores of the lake and make it feel magical of sorts. The holiday comes around and as is tradition for those on the lake, everyone takes their boats out to another quiet cove and waits. We wait for fireworks, launched off by the city just after the moon rises. The fireworks the previous year were notably short to the disbelief of the boat goers. However this year the city had certainly made up for it with what was maybe an hour long show. It was truly incredible. American music was being played from boats in every direction. You could hear the audible gasps and excitement with each new firework. It truly was an incredible sight and time. Afterwards, many people hung around on their boats talking with friends and even swimming in the black of night softly lit by boat lights. I'm definitely going back again."
