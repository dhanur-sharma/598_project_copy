I SAW QUITE A FEW PEOPLE AND IT WAS BUSY DUE TO THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND. ONE OF MY LAST PEOPLE TO SEE WAS PAUL M. PAUL IS A 57 YEAR OLD MALE WHO HAS MENTAL AND PHYSICAL DISABILTIES. AS I WAS WALKING PAUL BACK TO THE OFFICE HE SAID THAT HE NEEDED TO CHANGE HIS ADDRESS. WHEN I PRESSED HIM ABOUT MOVING HE STATED THAT HIS FRIENDS WIFE KICKED HIM OUT OF THE HOUSE AND HE DID NOT HAVE A PLACE TO GO. PAUL ASKED ME TO CALL HIS CTE WORKER TREY AND HE STATED THAT TREY WILL KNOW HOW TO GET A PLACE. I CONVICIED PAUL THAT I WOULD CALL AS SOON AS WE WERE DONE GOING OVER ALL OUR INFO. PAUL HAD JUST GONE TO COURT THIS MORNING AND HIS CASE WAS POSTPONED. I TOLD PAUL THAT BECUASE HE WAS DOING SUCH A GOOD JOB OF REPORTING HE WOULD NOT HAVE TO COME BACK TILL AFTER COURT. I THEN ATTEMPTED TO PLACE A CALL TO HIS CTE WORKER TREY EVENTHOUGH PAUL DID NOT HAVE THE # OR NAME OF THE PLACE WERE TREY WORKED. WE WERE ABLE TO LOCATE THE PLACE ON GOOGLE AND WERE ABLE TO CONTACT TREY. PAUL WAS SURE THAT TREY WAS GOING TO COME PICK HIM UP FOR MY OFFICE TO TAKE HIM TO HIS NEW APPARTMENT. WHEN PAUL'S EYES STARTED TO WELL UP WITH TEARS I KNEW IT WAS GOING AS HE THOUGHT. IT TURNED OUT THAT TREY HAD NOTHING AVAIABLE TODAY. EVERYTHING WAS OPENING UP TOMORROW. TREY TOLD PAUL TO GO TO THE RESOVLE SHELTER. PAUL WAS VERY UPSET BECUASE HE HAD NO MONEY FOR BUS FARE AND HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I WAS ABLE TO GIVE HIM $10 DOLLARS AND PROVIDED HIM WITH A COKE AND SOME CRACKERS. HE WAS SO EXCITED AND APPRICATIVE THAT HE ALMOST HUGED ME. HE YELLED IN THE PHONE AT TREY \"I GOT ME SOME BUS MONEY, I GOT ME SOME BUS MONEY AND I WILL SEE YOU TOMORROW\". THIS MADE ME FEEL GOOD."
