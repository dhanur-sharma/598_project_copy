        "Summarize the following story in first person: Today is Thursday. I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s been one week since all of the drama with my neighbor went down. I can\u2019t really understand how a women with such a great career and future ahead of her could stoop so low. I doubt she thought the truth would get out. An affair with a fairly new hire at her business, come on! Not to mention the thievery they committed together. They nearly stole millions of dollars from her company. I can\u2019t help but think this man came into the picture before getting hired by her. A heist this big had to have been planned for months. She totally took advantage of her managerial position and intentionally hired this guy to make their plan work. Honestly, how did they figure they wouldn\u2019t get caught?!   Now her children and her husband have to deal with the shame. Their name is all over the paper and the news. How could she compromise their well-being and peace for her own selfish gain...it\u2019s sickening. I\u2019m glad somebody caught on and told on them. The nerve she had to lie right to the police officers face!  I really can\u2019t fathom how her poor family must be feeling."
