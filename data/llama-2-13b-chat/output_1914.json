        "Summarize the following story in first person: My husband who is a wealthy business man has hired his ex girlfriend as his secretary recently. It all started 1 year ago when we were in love before getting married. The women who he was cheating me with is hes girlfriend during the college, they told me that they were only friends until i found that they were dating secretly. My best friend saw them on a coffee shop and told me twice to take precautions but i did not trust my friend at that time since i know both my husband and the women he was cheating with. One day when i came early from office i saw both of them in bedroom. I was shocked to see them in my bedroom half nakedly. i started to scream and also made attempts to hit the women my husband was cheating with but my husband protected her from me and sent her home. Two days passed then my husband came and explained me how they both got in to relationship and begged me to forgive him for his actions and also said hi will never cheat on me again. But he has hired her as his secretary a month ago and he didn't tell me anything about it. I think my husband has feelings for her. that is why he is hiding from me but has also recruited as hes secretary. There are lot of questions running on my mind right now. But i cannot tell anyone about it since it will create a bad image about my husband. I have given a second chance for my husband i do not think he will misuse it but it makes me very uncomfortable that the women he was cheating on is his current secretary. I will find out again if he is dating the same women and take some serious actions this time."
