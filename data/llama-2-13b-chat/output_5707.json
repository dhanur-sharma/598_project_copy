        "Summarize the following story in first person: I finally have a chance to write about what happened two weeks ago when my niece was born. I was sitting home alone relaxing when I get a frantic phone call from my sister in law who lives around the block. She said she feels some pain and thinks she might be having the baby. She was 38 weeks pregnant, so I figured it was just Braxton Hicks contractions, but I headed over to her house anyway. Once I got there and saw the puddle of liquid on the floor around her I knew she was having the baby. She didn't want to call an ambulance because they would take her to the closest hospital, not the one she wanted to go to. I had no choice but to drive her. This was her third child and the doctors had predicted that once she went into labor she would deliver very quickly, so I was terrified she was going to deliver my niece in my car. The 45 minute drive to the hospital was the most nerve wracking experience of my life. I can't even explain how much I was shaking and praying. I was praying we made it, I was praying I wouldn't have to deliver a baby on the side of the road. For as much as I was freaking out my sister in law was surprisingly calm. She focused on her breathing and didn't talk much. I could tell as we approached the hospital that the pain was starting to be too much for her. I pulled up outside of the hospital and she jumped out and ran into the emergency room. I parked the car and ran inside after her. They took her into the delivery room right away and luckily my brother was able to make it to the hospital before the baby was born. After it was all over it felt great to be so involved in the birth of my niece. It was a long day, but once all my family came to the hospital to be with us and visit it turned out to be a great experience."
