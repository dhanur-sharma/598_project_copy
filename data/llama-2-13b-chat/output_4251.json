        "Summarize the following story in first person: About a month ago, I brought the old lady to Rocky Gap Casino for the weekend because, first of all, I was feeling lucky, and secondly, I wanted to get lucky, if you catch my drift. Anyways, the drive there was pretty uneventful except for a huge accident on the interstate that caused us to arrive about a half hour later than we had anticipated. When we entered the casino, and that unforgettable scent of stale cigarette smoke and spilled booze hit me in the nose, those siren sounds of the slot machines caressed my eardrums, and the highly oxygenated air filled my lungs, I felt like today was going to be my day. Something was different about this trip, an electricity was in the air, and it was not the same electricy I had felt on so many of mmy prior trips to this particular casino. I handed my girlfriend a hundred dollar bill and she made a beeline for the high-limit slots, while I directed myself to the craps table. Let me tell you it was hopping, and everybody was cheering and hollering, but most importantly making some serious dough. I see a spot open up, so I belly up to the table and place a pass line bet, and wait for the shooter to throw. The shooter, a black gentleman who looks like he's knows a little about throwing dice, grabs the shiny red cubes and tosses them a couple of times against the sidewall, then arranges them meticulously before snatching them up and tossing them high into the air. They land at the other side of the table, bounce once and careen off the backwall, then land softly; the stickman has a look. \"Seven, front line winner, pay the line!\", he calls out. The stickman slides the dice back to the shooter, where he again arranges and then tosses them expertly. \"Yoooooo eleven! Pay the line!\" calls the dealer as the players pick thier winnings up off the table. Well wouldn't you believe it, this shooter would go on to hit five straight points, earning me a cool thousand dollars in the process! I was so happy, I decided to treat my girlfriend to eat at the casino buffett afterwards, where we dined on delicious crab legs the size of a baby's arm, and prime rib so succulent, it melted the moment it hit your tounge. What a fantastic day!"
