        "Summarize the following story in first person: Three months ago, I was watching P.S. I Love You. The main character Holly, lost her husband to cancer. She was devastated, young, and angry. She spent a lot of time alone, called off work; stopped living, essentially. A few weeks after her husband's death, while she was grieving alone, her friends and family showed up to her apartment to wish her a happy birthday. Holly had turned 30 years old. It was then I was hit with the idea that the dreaded thirties are coming my way. I ruminated on the years that had passed me already. How I'd never again experienced all the good things I've lived through. I also thought about all the bad things I never have to live through again. Once was enough for me, and in a larger sense, I suppose that's good with both the good things and the bad things. And although devastated in thinking about the past, I was met with a bittersweet overall feeling: I have lived a good life. Thinking about my upcoming birthday, I decided that I wouldn't make a big deal about it because I would just be grateful to be alive another day. When my birthday comes, I would celebrate in silence, in peace. Although, the dreaded thirties are almost here, I have come to peace with it."
