        "Summarize the following story in first person: Two months ago I went to a music festival not to far away from me with my girlfriend and our friend Jess. During our drive there the weather looked like it was going to rain but by the time we got there the sun was shining. We decided to drive to the festival instead of camping because the music festival was not that far away and I had to go to work the following day. When we arrived at the festival we had to find parking which took a very long time. Afterwards we unpacked our chairs and blanket and started the hike up the hill to the main stage. Once we found a spot to place our equipment I headed off in search of food. Part of the reason why I like going to festivals is the food, I love to eat. It took about 30 minutes but I returned with enough food and snacks to feed an army. I was ready to settle in and enjoy the show. My girlfriend and our friend Jess had other plans. They wanted to go shopping and see all of the booths that were set up before the show started. I relaxed and ate while they went shopping. By the time they came back the show had started and they had shirts for all of us.  Everyone was happy and settled in to enjoy the show. We watched a few bands and hung out for a while when all of a sudden friends of ours from school happened to walk by. We got their attention and caught up about how our summers were going. We then decided to sit together and enjoy the rest of the concert. There was a surprise band that played after the headliner to close the show. We were all blown away by the quality of the performance. While the last band was playing the encore song we headed to the car in an attempt to beat some of the traffic. While we drove home we discussed which bands and songs we liked the most. All in all it was a great day."
