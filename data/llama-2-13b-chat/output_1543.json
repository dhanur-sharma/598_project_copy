        "Summarize the following story in first person: We decided that we wanted to experience everything that was unique and interesting about Mexico.   Since this trip was only about 3 months ago, the memories are still very fresh and upfront in my mind.   My friends and I had done research a week or two before we left so we knew which excursions we wanted to take.   My favorite excursion was when we toured some ancient ruins which showed the way that the indigenous people pf Mexico originally lived.   I learned that in these cultures, it was not uncommon for the tribesman to run barefoot from one village to the next - which was sometimes as much as 50 miles.  It was amazing to learn how this activity evolved the culture into these super-athletes who had amazing endurance and stamina.    Another favorite excursion was a tour of a real Mexican plant where authentic Mexican food is made.  After the tour, my friends and I ate an amazing meal of true authentic Mexican food that was out of this world.  At the end of the meal, a mariachi band came over to serenade me with an authentic rendition of \"Happy Birthday\"!  I thanked my friends for setting up this amazing surprise.   Another favorite excursion was our trip out to a Mexican ranching farm.   We learned about some of the differences between ranch farming in the U.S. as compared to Mexico.   I was impressed with the dedication and commitment that Mexican ranch farmers have to make to succeed in this business due to the hot climate and dusty terrain.   Our last excursion was a trip though Mexico City.    I was amazed to learn about the high elevation of Mexico City and the frequent earthquakes that occur.   I was also impressed with the vibrancy and energy that seemed to permeate  through the city.    My recent trip to Mexico for my birthday was an amazing trip and one that I'll remember and think fondly back on for the rest of my life."
