        "Summarize the following story in first person: I had been a housewife for 18 years until my daughter went off to college. She left about 12 months ago and it was hard for me. This was her actual first day away from home. I had sheltered her for so long. Then the day finally came where she became an adult. I tried to talk her into staying home during her first year of college but she wanted freedom. I understood because I was the same way when I moved away from home. She is my only child so I felt lonely when she left. I talk to her everyday but life hasn't been the same. Maybe if she was closer to home I would feel better. After the semester ended, I thought she would come back home, but she decided to stay. She said that was her home now. The bright side is that I had one last lunch with her at a Chinese restaurant that was near her apartment. I told her how proud I was and how much I was going to miss her. Although this has been hard for me,  I know she is becoming a young woman. The first day was just the hardest."
