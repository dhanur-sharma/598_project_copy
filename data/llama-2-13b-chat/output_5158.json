        "Summarize the following story in first person: One thing that happened to me and was memorable is the passing of my partner\u2019s first cousin.  He became ill and days later got admitted into the hospital.  The end of the day when he got admitted, he passed away and my partner was coming back home.  I was with the cousin\u2019s girlfriend as everything happened and I felt completely heartbroken for everyone. the mourning process was long.  It took a day for me to process exactly what had happened.   I felt like it was my duty to be strong for everyone but it was so difficult. My partner has been very sad and I keep trying to have him remain positive. I am constantly thinking about the kids and the family. I am putting everyone else as a priority just to make sure everyone is ok.  We have had a a couple of rough nights and days as we are coping with the loss. We are still to this day trying to understand and accept what had happened. I know as time passes things will get t better. Little by little the acceptance will sink in.  I hope it is a lesson for everyone to maintain good health and peace among the family. And everyone will hopefully remember how much of a happy person he was no matter what was going on."
