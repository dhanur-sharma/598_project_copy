        "Summarize the following story in first person: This summer was very hard for me me and my boyfriend broke up. We have been going threw a lot of problems and even fighting with each other. I have been so depressed i couldnt even very out of bed i just been hating myself. Ive gotten down to thoght about taking my own life. My boyfriend cheated on me with me with one of my friends just becuase he saw her on facebook. I am so upset i can manage i thought he loved me like no one else. I can blame anyone but myself my mom once told me before she left that no one is going to love me like my family is going to love me. My only hope is that i can find myself again ive been struggling though everyday its a battle just to eveh eat food. I would like to sing i often write my own songs in hope of freedom. My class mate tells me dont worry about anything but just helping myself. These days i just feel like smashing my head threw a wall becuase i am just being consumed by overwheling revaltions about this world and who i ama. I dont know how people can just move on like that do they not feel as deeply as they show. Have mercy on me have mercy on my soul. I cannot forgive myself at least not yet i am trying and trying. I want to be proud of myself and make the ones who came before me proud."
