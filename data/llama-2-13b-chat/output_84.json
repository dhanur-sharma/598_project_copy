        "Summarize the following story in first person: During this Summer session, we visited a dozen of university campuses and got very impressive memories on a few schools. Through talking with the admission officers and touring students, we captured a lot of information about admission policy, documents need to be prepared, majors, and student campus life. It was very helpful for my child to select ones they are interested in and would pursue their studies in the future. It is is very important to touch these necessary information early prior to their application deadlines. We drove to a few cities nearby where the universities we are interested in located. We visited 2 schools each day during this trip. We first visited a few schools on the east coast, then visited others on the southwest side. A few Ivy leagues schools were included into this trip. According to the well known rule, we divided these schools into three categories, reach, match, and safe to schedule our visit concentrations. For a reach school, we focused on to learn more about the admission policy. For a match or safe school, we concentrated on the required documents including SAT test scores. During the visit, we figured out which major could be more promising one when applying for a reach school, considering as a premed track student later on. For a match or safe school, we strictly followed up the most interested major such as Biomedical engineering in one engineering school. We compared the similar ranks of schools in terms of student population size, campus life, major strength, faculty to student ratio etc. We finally narrowed down to 10 schools in our list. One of things need to mentioned especially here: be sure to check in on time prior to your information session. For example, WashU treated a campus visiting as the demonstrated interesting of a student on them. Some of schools followed up us after our campus visiting. It is also useful for a family to on-site check the student residence and meal plan in one specific school. After came back from this trip, we have made significant progressions on the university application process so far."
