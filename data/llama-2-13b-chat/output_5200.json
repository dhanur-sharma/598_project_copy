        "Summarize the following story in first person: This is unbelievable. My crappy refrigerator finally kicked the bucket. Even worse, I have no money to get a new one. I went and checked out one I saw on Craigslist, but I'm pretty sure something was growing in it. Too bad my credit sucks. I went and applied for a Lowe's Card and got denied, story of my life. As if it wasn't bad enough, my girlfriend started arguing with me about it. I didn't think it was very mature to call me names because of something I don't seem to have any control over. She hasn't tried to get a new one. I'm not really sure why this is only my problem. It looks like I'm just going to have to get fat eating fast food for awhile until I save up enough money to get one. Maybe I should giver her an ultimatum. I shouldn't have to deal with this myself. It should be both of our problems. I just hope some family and friends have some odd jobs I can do to speed up the process."
