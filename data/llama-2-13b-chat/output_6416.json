        "Summarize the following story in first person: Work can be stressful for most people, but for me, I feel like my job takes it to another level. For one, my boss is always on my back. I never feel like I can just be myself or do my job, because she'll always hassle me about one thing or another. This has completely altered my mental health. I feel like I'm anxious all the time. I go to work, and am just nitpicked to death. I started to hate my otherwise good job. I still enjoyed other aspects of my job, like the actual work itself and the fact that I was helping people. It still felt good. I decided one day that I wasn't going to let my boss control my work situation. I decided to go to my local mental health clinic. There, I was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder, and given some anti-anxiety medication. I have never felt better. Now, my boss doesn't stress me out so much. I couldn't be happier in the slightest."
