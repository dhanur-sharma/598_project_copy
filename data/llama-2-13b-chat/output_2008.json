        "Summarize the following story in first person: In May 2019, my partner and I got into a car accident on Route 87. We were lucky to be alive given the damages and everything that happened. We had just had a great time at a concert for Jai Wolf in Santa Cruz and were on our way back home. I had an exam the next day and my partner was exhausted, but took the liberty of driving us back home. While I was looking down on my phone to study, I felt the car jerk in a bad way and then looked up just to see us about to collide into the mountain. Luckily, my partner maneuvered the car in such a way where yes, we collided but we didn't completely disable us from getting back home. It was a horrifying time after going through such a great time. We continued driving, even though the headlight and bumper were almost wiped off the car. I remember him panicking and breathing funny due to anxiety. I can also remember the moment that we got home and it was such a relief, but it felt like it wasn't over yet. My partner still had to contact his parents and let them know about the car, and I still needed to finish studying for my exam. We checked out the damages when we got home and it was worse than we thought. We weren't sure if we'd be able to drive it again and felt lucky we even made it back home. We chose not to get cops involved because of insurance purposes. I wish that we could go back and I would drive again."
