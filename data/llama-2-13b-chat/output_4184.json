        "Summarize the following story in first person: I broke up with my ex girlfriend. This is because she cheated on me. I am not sad because i have been looking for ways to breakup with her since she started acting strangely in the relationship. I told her friends and my friends and no one seems to be of help. That is why i took matters into my own hand. I do not feel bad about the issue at all, because i already found another girlfriend. And i believe had  better attitude than my ex. she has a good family background. she came from a good home. she keeps good friends who are ready to give her good advice. I am going on a trip with her to Australia next week. I am going to have  fun and shop because i will soon propose to her. I think she is the love of my life. and she will have my kids. I am sure my dad and mum will be happy to hear this good news.                                                                                                                                                         - happened 6 years ago."
