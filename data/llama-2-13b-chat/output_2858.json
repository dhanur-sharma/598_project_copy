        "Summarize the following story in first person: Four months ago Trey was offered a job by a tech company in California. On one hand I'm thrilled that he was offered a job in his dream field and position. He's worked so hard to get there, taken all of the necessary classes, learned all the needed skills, and I know his interview went fantastic. It's great seeing my husband succeed at such a wonderful company. This is a life-changing event for the both of us. It was a little surprising that he was able to find this job so quickly, with only two weeks on the job hunt, after having switch fields. For him, it's the accomplishment of reaching a long held goal. But for me, it was the worry and uncertainty at the idea of moving so far from home and my family. As happy as I was for him four months ago, I can't say I wasn't a little concerned and frightened at the idea. My family and I have always been extremely close. We take trips together, plan holidays with each other, are often going on vacations  with one another. My sister and I, in particular are incredibly close and consider each other best friends. Leaving them all back in Tennessee is hard for me, because I feel like I'm abandoning my family. Don't get me wrong I absolutely love my husband and I'm committed to supporting him. One of the best things about his job is the pay increase will allow for us to afford to send me back to graduate school. I just wish I could have picked up my family and moved them to California with me. It's been four months since I've last had a BBQ at their house, or teased my sister in person and I miss them dearly. Trey and I have made some new friends during this move, and they have been a great help for adjusting to this new life in California. In fact one of our new friends, went through the same scenario as me and she too had to move for her husband's job. I think with the help of new friends, Trey and the promise of my family to come and visit, I can adjust and thrive in this new life."
