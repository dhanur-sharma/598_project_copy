        "Summarize the following story in first person: My dad got remarried. It came as a sudden surprise as he had not told us anything about it and so me and my younger brother were shocked. The emotional wounds of losing our mother 2 years prior were still fresh and the pain had yet to fade. So when he invited us out to dinner and brought along a lady-friend, we were surprised to say the least when he announced to us that this was his fiance and that they were to be wed in a few days. Our dad was never really close to us growing up so communication was always a little awkward. We respected him and he respected us, but he was never much of a \"father\". Instead it was our mom that kept us on track, fed us, drove us to all our activities, and was there when we needed someone to talk to. I guess this is typical of an Asian family, stereotype or not. But still, he mourned just as much as me or my brother when it came to the loss of our mom and I had felt our familial ties pull taught as now we were down to just the three of us. At that time I was just graduating college and my brother was transferring between universities, so none of us were prepared to lose someone so important so early on. It felt like our lives were just beginning and we imagined our mom to be there every step of the way, to introducing our future girlfriends to eventually seeing our mom hold our future kids with the same love that they had blessed our childhood with. All of that was gone now. So him announcing his new marriage just 2 years later felt so fast and abrupt to me. I felt like we barely had any time to process my mom's death, and now I suddenly had to face another big shift in our family. Maybe it partly had to due with my dad's lack of communication, but that fault also laid with me as I had not really attempted to make any headway in understanding each other either. So I guess in hindsight it's understandable, why he chose to wait until the very last minute to announce a new family member. It didn't feel like a replacement of our mom. It just felt like a new companion for our dad, someone to keep him busy and help him move on. I still don't even refer to her as \"mom\" but as \"auntie\" and she seems to be very understanding of such. After all, how can you replace someone that loved you for 25 years of your life. My dad got an early start, and we're all starting to progress in our own lives now, but the memory of my mom lives on."
