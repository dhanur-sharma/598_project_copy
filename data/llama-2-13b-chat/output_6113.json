        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was on my break from work and sitting eating outside when someone came up to me and said they were filming a movie in the mall. She said they needed people to do extra work at the weekend in some bar scenes downtown. She asked if I'd be available that weekend to be an extra and I said I would. I conformed that it would  be paid and she took my details. On Friday evening I got an email with directions and instructions for the nxt day. I was nervous and still a little sceptical but I went down on Saturday anyway. I was sitting in the holding area for about 90 minutes when I was asked to follow the assistant director. They took me to the hair and makeup trailer and after looking me over they asked if I would be interested in being a body double. This meant an increase in pay and I got to be part of the action in the longest scene of the day standing opposite the leading man. We did many, many takes and I was standing in for all the rehearsals and about 12 takes of the scene. I got direction from the director and the crew was very nice to me. We were taken to a 5 star hotel in the city for lunch and I got to sit and eat with the stars rather than the other extras. The day was long, I was there about 14 hours all in but I got to be a famous actresses body double for the day, I earned a lot of money, I met the stars and the director and they asked me to come back the next day, Sunday, where they put me in a bar scene and gave me a decent amount of screen time sitting behind the leads. This also took a long time and we were at the bar for about 10 hours with another lunch break. That day we got cash to go buy our own lunch. We got $50 each so that was nice and I got to pocket most of it.  It was something I never though I would do and it was a very cool day."
