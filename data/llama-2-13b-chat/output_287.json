        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was let go from my job several months ago. I believe it's been exactly 5 months. I always thought I was really good at the job and I really enjoyed what I was doing. I was marketing analyst and enjoyed playing with number and looking for trends. I really liked helping my clients grow their companies. So, it came as a surprised when my boss told me I was being let go. The agency I worked for was doing well financially and they had to cut back on expenses. I knew they were having a tough time but I never thought it would affect me. I assumed if they had to lay anyone off it would newer hires and not people like me who had been with the company for years. I was really disappointed and surprised.  Now I'm left trying to find a new job but it's possible I might look into a new career path. Finding a new job hasn't been as easy as I thought it would. I have a part time job now and I'm struggling to pay the bills. I have some still have some savings left but it's starting to dry up. Things are starting to look pretty grim and I'm really afraid. There's a part of me who thinks I should go back to school and try a new career but I can't afford to go back to school So for right now I'm stuck and I'm trying to figure what to do next. Whatever it is I have to figure out something soon."
