        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last week I went to an amusement park for the first time and I was finally able to overcome one of my greatest fears - not being in control. I got there late which was an intentional delay on my part. I wasn't ready to face it. It was 3pm and I tried my best to avoid the roller coasters, only the individuals that I was fortunate to be in the company of were thrill seekers, in the highest sense. I was faced with two choices: to face my fears or stand alone. Of course, I stood alone. Not once, not twice, but three times until it became clear that I did not belong here. The separation I felt was immense. I had seen my friends go on these rides and come out unharmed and very satisfied, what was I afraid of? My closest friend gave me the nudge I needed. She said, \"Its fun because you're not in control.\" I couldnt wrap my head around that but it made me curious. That is how my love for roller coasters began. There's nothing you can do to prepare your body for the resistance it feels when youre plunged downward at high speeds - nothing! It may be a simple event but it was very emotional for me, as I had come out of my comfort zone and I didnt regret it. I accepted that I cant always be in control and sometimes that's okay."
