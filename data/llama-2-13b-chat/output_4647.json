        "Summarize the following story in first person: I have been married with my wife for 4 years now. Our relationship has been pretty much perfect. We rarely ever argue and even when we have small disagreements, we communicate about them and find a middle ground. I got promoted at work and was transferred to a different location, so I asked my wife to move. We moved to a different city in a somewhat suburban neighborhood. We have many neighbors close-by and one of them came to welcome us at the house. He came with his wife with some house-warming gifts and some food. They told us that they had just moved in the neighborhood a few days before and were already used to it. They told us everything we needed to know about the neighborhood and where basic necessities are located. We spent about 2 hours together that evening. At some point during the night, my neighbor approached my wife and they talked. He seemed to be making her laugh and she was very entertained to talk to him. After they left, my wife started telling me how nice of a man he was. She said we should return the favor and go visit them. We went there one evening and as my neighbor's wife was preparing food, he couldn't keep his eyes off my wife and they talked a great deal. I could see that their bond was strengthening, and as we went back home, hardly a day passed by that she didn't mention him in a conversation in a complimentary manner. I started to see our relationship deteriorate and our bond get weaker. You can imagine my surprise when three months ago, I received divorce papers from her with reasons that I don't understand."
