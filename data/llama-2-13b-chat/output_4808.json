        "Summarize the following story in first person: Three months ago we went on a long anticipated trip to the Oregon Coast, we had been planning this trip for months and the whole family were so excited. I Googled the weather before we went because I was really worried about rain, I know it is summer but you just never know. Thankfully the weather forecast for the whole week was bright sunshine. We packed a lot of sunscreen, I needed a new bathing suit so went shopping the week before and found the perfect one, I don't usually go to the beach. The kids got new books to keep them busy on the drive there and I swear I repacked at least seven times. We took a lot of games to play because the kids get bored easily and we wanted to make it a tech free vacation so we knew we needed to keep them busy! We ended up playing a lot of games on the trip, especially poker, who knew it was so much fun! I think the highlight of the trip for me was collecting seashells, we wanted to get enough to make some jewelry when we got home, my youngest kid was so excited about this and spent hours searching for the perfect shells. It is actually crazy how many washed up on the shore, we really enjoyed walking along the beach and it was so peaceful. I was surprised to see so few other people, I mean it was June, you would think there would be people everywhere. We saw maybe 10 people the whole time. It was so relaxing and we would sit in the hot tub in the evening and just remove stress from daily life. The kids want to go back soon and even my husband who is more of an inside type person is asking to go back! I think it is probably one of the best vacations we have ever had. And the best part is nobody got sunburn! I think the only thing I would change is the hotel we stayed in, it was rated as four star but it was not great and overpriced. I will have to research better for next year now we know we love the location."
