        "Summarize the following story in first person: I had been miserable for quite some time with no answers from any of the doctors I had seen. Finally went to see a knowledgeable ENT doctor who is an understanding, kind person and was told my nose was filled with polyps and terribly deviated septum. I went through the process and had surgery done. The first few days after were rather terrible, lots of pain, sinuses packed and stents put in to prevent swelling and allow drainage. My mother took care of myself and small child so my husband could still work, we wouldn't have been able to make it through without her and I'm eternally grateful. I went back for the first follow up appointment and he removed the packing and stuck a light and suction tube in my sinuses and sucked out gobs and gobs of congealed blood. Although it was completely gross to watch and not the greatest feeling, afterwards I felt air in places in my sinuses that I'm not sure I've ever felt. Even though I was blowing out blood and gunk for the next week and still taking pain pills since Doc had broken and set my septum, I'd never felt so light and happy. I did take a lot of vitamin C throughout this time frame and Doc was impressed with how quickly I healed up from fairly invasive surgery. Most people take breathing through the nose for granted. Imagine what it feels like to have a sinus infection and then to feel like that for years and multiple doctors just handing out antibiotics and steroids. At one point I was even prescribed antidepressants because he thought it was all in my head. It has been a very frustrating journey through the 'healthcare system'.Its been almost 6 months now and I continue to be hopeful that I can keep the polyps from coming back as science today doesn't seem to know why they form. Unfortunately, it really is up to me to figure out how my body works, what it needs to operate appropriately and perhaps find an Orthomolecular Doctor who can help me do so and treat me in a holistic fashion. Insurance companies don't like these kinds of Doctors and don't usually cover much, I suppose if you heal yourself and prevent problems they don't make much money. The irony."
