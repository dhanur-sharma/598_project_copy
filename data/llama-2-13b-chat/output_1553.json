        "Summarize the following story in first person: When I was in college I met someone that I really liked. We had so much in common and I thought he liked me just as much. We dated for several months and then I found out he had another girlfriend as well. He says we weren't dating exclusively but I felt differently. I was not dating anyone else. It was really hard to see him with other girls. I missed being with him.  I was sad for several days. I wanted him back and tried to get him back.  Later, after 3 months of not being with him, I was told that he was unfaithful to his current girlfriend and on to another girl.  I was so happy that we broke up earlier in the school year. This taught me that things work out for a reason. I taught me to be true to myself and the right person will come along. I no longer fall for someone so quickly. I don't allow myself to fall for someone so quickly."
