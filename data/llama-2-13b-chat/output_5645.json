        "Summarize the following story in first person: my wife and i had been having issues resulting from a range of problems. the most compelling had been the little time we spent together. so i decided to try to fix the issues we had by discussing with her and looking for a way to resolve the issue. she reluctantly agreed to a number of things we should do and changes so as to make our marriage work. among the things she said was that she wanted a trip to a wonderful island somewhere in chile . she had seen  the place on a magazine. she said it will help us rejuvenate our relationship. i was reluctant at first but later agreed. i took some days off from work and took some loans to help fund the trip. we made arrangements and took off to the island. this happened two months ago. on our way to the island i started feeling like i had made a mistake, considering the cost and stress. because i was not talking as she should she was also quiet. the trip was very slow and boring. the closer we got to island the more i felt i made a mistake making that trip. we when i got to the island i was amazed as to how beautiful it was lots of sight seeing. beautiful landscape. This story captures the awe-inspiring island of Chilo\u00e9, Chile in a nutshell. Speaking to a small first day hike we took that culminated in walking among penguins and feeling quite proud of the accomplishment. it was a memorable experience that i would never forget. that trip fixed my marriage and i was glad i made that trip."
