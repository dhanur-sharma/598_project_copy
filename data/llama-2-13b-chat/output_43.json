        "Summarize the following story in first person: As many women, and men, my husband and I couldn't wait to be parents. We all assumed getting pregnant was easy and that there wouldn't be many obstacles in the way, since the world perpetrates it as easy to conceive. Well boy were we wrong. After a year of trying and tracking my cycles we decided to seek medical intervention. We did test after test only to be given an \"unexplained infertility\" diagnosis. We were both young and healthy and couldn't believe this was happening. We were told to keep trying for an additional six months, before our Dr was willing to discuss treatment options. During this six months, I got pregnant 4 times, yet each resulted in an early loss. Because we had finally managed to conceive our Dr held off on treatments. Over the course of the next 18 months I got pregnant two more times. One resulting in a 25 week loss, and the other resulting in a 9 month loss two days before my due date from a cord accident. At this point, we were beyond devastated and just done. We couldn't bear the heartache anymore, and we couldn't afford the astronomical fees associated with IVF. We took a vacation a few months later, and lo and behold I ended up pregnant. I felt disconnected during the pregnancy as I was certain it would end every single day. Well I proud to say it didn't, and we have a happy and healthy baby girl! We finally got our miracle."
