        "Summarize the following story in first person: I really wish that you had come with it Peter Vietnam is beautiful. The flight from London Heathrow Airport really wasn't that bad with only one stop. I was so excited i didn't want to sleep . The hotel was beautiful and right next to Phu Quoc Island. I went to the beach everyday of my stay. I don't even know where too begin.  What i pictured is nothing like what I thought .Vietnam reminds me of New York.  Bursting with nightlife bars everywhere. People in a rush everywhere to take in all the site. On the recommendation of a friend I signed up for a bike tour.  I found it a fantastic way of getting around and see things that i would of never had access to on foot. I worried that I would see some small signs  of the war that happens years ago. But there wasn't any that i found not any mention of it anywhere. I wondered was it because they didn't want tourists too feel uncomfortable.  I would liek  to go back and learn more of the history. Maybe next time you can go with me."
