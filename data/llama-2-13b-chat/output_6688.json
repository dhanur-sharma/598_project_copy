        "Summarize the following story in first person: I can't get upset or angry very easily. Whether it's with my spouse, friends or colleagues, I find myself getting emotional over minor things. A few weeks ago, one of my direct reports made an error in a project that was presented to senior management. We didn't catch the error until after the presentation.  Our conclusions would have been different had we not made the error. I spent a day explaining to the meeting attendees what had happened and how we would fix it.  I was also very angry with my analyst who didn't double check his work.  I told him that I am going to give him a bad review on the project and that will definitely affect his bonus for the year.  After the dust settled, I felt awful. First, I could have caught the mistake myself had I paid more attention to the presentation.  Second, most people were understanding as we were going to fix the error.  Third, this incident carried over in the evening to my home where I was upset and was rude to my spouse and son.  The learning from this incident is that I should learn to be calm under pressure.  I should start with being kind to myself, and then be kind to others.  Though I have known this for years, I have never been able to put this into practice.  But I am going to take a sincere effort and improve myself going forward.  I am also planning to take some online courses and read books to help me improve.  I apologized to my colleagues, my wife and my  son after the incident.  Only time will tell if I can improve."
