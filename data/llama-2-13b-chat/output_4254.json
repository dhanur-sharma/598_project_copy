        "Summarize the following story in first person: Dear Diary,This morning I almost forgot to say my daily prayer! I don't think God would mind if I missed one day, but I would certainly feel something was wrong if I did. Thankfully I saw the framed scripture I have on the wall and it reminded me. This morning I thanked God for helping me find a good job. It's part time, but I haven't had a job in months and was getting worried I never would. It's at a nice company and I love my coworkers so far. I'm still working on amazon mturk as well on the side. I'm not doing as much as I was before but it's still a nice bit of extra income. I also thanked God for the family I have left. My brother stopped by the other day to check on me. I'm always glad to see him, I know he's having a hard time too and we can support each other. I bet mom and dad would be proud of us. Really though I think the Church is the biggest support system for both of us. They welcomed us in no questions asked and have been great for us. I think God really wanted us to find that Church. If we pull off our plan to save up money and move back to California in a few years leaving the church will be the hardest part."
