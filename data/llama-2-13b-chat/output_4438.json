        "Summarize the following story in first person: This afternoon I passed my CompTIA exam. I was terrified when I walked into the testing room. The only thing that calmed my nerves was that I was the only person testing that day and was situated all the way in the back. I came in to the room prepared to the best of my ability. I had spent months studying for this but did not have any experience in what it was, so I figured anything could happen. I knew that I was at the point in my life where I needed a career change and needed to begin settling down, so this was a big deal. If I failed the first step, what would that say about my future? So I turned the computer on and started with the exam. Right off the bat I was sure that I would fail. The questions were worded very oddly and it took a few reading before I was able to get what they were asking me. The only thing that I feel saved me was flagging those questions and going back to them later. That gave me more confidence when I would easily get the more understandable questions. I felt nervous the entire time. I felt that I had wasted my money to get the voucher to do this. What I felt was my only saving grace were the Performance Based Questions where you have to do things like set up a router, create an email address and set up the correct ports/protocols, etc. People said those were supposed to be the hardest, but I found them the easiest. You couldn't imagine my shock when I saw the screen congratulating me for passing. It was such an odd experience for me. I have a new certification to take next month, and I'm hoping I can take the confidence I've gathered from this experience and apply it to that one."
