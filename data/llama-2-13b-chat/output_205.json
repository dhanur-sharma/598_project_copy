        "Summarize the following story in first person: My car was towed to an impound yard from my paid parking space by my landlady in a nasty move.  So, the drama continues about the landlady's action.  I have had to file suit in Small Claims Court to recover my expenses.  Of course it is on my mind since it takes roughly forever to get the matter called up before the judge.  She's really a property manager, not the owner/landlady so I got to serve the owner of the property.  Since he is out-of-state I am betting he won't show up and I will get a default judgment.  Small Claims Court is nice because he can't send a lawyer or another representative in to appear for him.  I am looking forward to resolving this matter to recover my money and to be validated. Though this happened a while back I still become angry and agitated when I recall it.  I would like to see this woman fired.  I know it's not nice to seek revenge, but she does so deserve it.   She is a very nasty woman.  I have, and continue to, observe her mistreating tenants and the other employees of the building alike.  It's past time that she receives her comeuppance.  I would enjoy being the person who delivers it to her."
