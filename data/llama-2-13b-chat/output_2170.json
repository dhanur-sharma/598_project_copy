        "Summarize the following story in first person: This was when we lost our home to foreclosure. We fell behind on our mortgage payments and the bank would not work with us. We tried for months to be able to save our home and realized that it just wasn't going to happen. This was a very difficult time in our lives as we felt like failures. We had to tell our family that we were losing our house including our children. It felt helpless and we didn't know how we would find a place to live. Our credit was now terrible and everyone checks credit these days. We were going to need someone to take a chance on us and look past our credit worthiness. We looked at many houses, but people were not getting back to us most likely because of our credit. Finally we found a couple that was just looking for a family they felt that they could trust. We met with them a few times and they offered there house to rent. It ended up being a good situation for us as it was in a better neighborhood and had some more space. We are trying to control our spending now so that we can eventually be homeowners again and live in this type of neighborhood for a long time. We plan out our bills better now and use software to make sure we are on time. We have learned a lot from this experience and will make sure to never have to live it again."
