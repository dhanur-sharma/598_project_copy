        "Summarize the following story in first person: A little over a year ago one of my worst nightmares came true, I lost someone so near and dear to my heart. My father passed away. It was so sudden too. It's scary to truly realize now how quickly your whole life can change. A matter of seconds, really. You can be eating breakfast with your loved one and then later get the worst call of your life.... Will this weight on my heart ever lighten? And as if that wasn't enough, the process in closing the family estate was such a long ordeal that it really just stretched our grief out longer and made us all incredibly stressed. There were literally points where mom was stressed to the point that she couldn't eat. And yes, I mean more than once. Talk about a total nightmare. But, there has finally, FINALLY, been a light at the end of the tunnel. The estate has been closed. It took a long time but we did it! There were times that we felt like this would literally never happen, you have no idea. And now we are finally at a point that we can move on. Well, not move on, because now we all have a piece of us missing... But, we can at least find a new normal."
