        "Summarize the following story in first person: On August 20th of this year at 6:30 am, I called out of work and drunkenly drove myself to the local Crisis Stabilization Unit, which was thankfully about two minutes from my home. I parked my car in the fire lane and walked in. Drunk me figured this was the only way I would be able to kick the almost five year curse that was my addiction to alcohol. Drunk me also reasoned that if I kept drinking the way I was, I would either take my own life or die from organ failure. I went up to the reception area and informed the receptionist I needed to be admitted for intoxication, alcohol addiction and suicidal ideation. I gave her my insurance information, filled out the paperwork, and sat in the lobby. I had stopped before getting to the facility and bought and drank two small wine bottles. I could feel them kicking in and with the alcohol running through my body I sat and waited, convinced this was my only option; the only way I would stay alive. I was called back by a paramedic who took my vitals and had me take a breathalyzer. I was 2 times the legal limit; he said if I drove away before sobering up the cops would be called. Back in the lobby, as the wine started to wear off I felt panic. No longer sure if this was the right move, I wondered if walking home was an option. In front of me a door opened and a bald man called me into his office. The substance abuse counselor asked me some generic questions about my addiction, and informed me I would have to stay for 24 hours. I would not be able to keep my phone, I would need to change out of my clothing, and I would be in a room being monitored. Sobering up, I was almost certain I was ready to walk home. A very attractive nurse came out, and explained that I would be strip searched. I still had some liquid courage in me and told her absolutely not, and refused to sign the consent form. I told her I would sit in the lobby and sober up. She left, and I called my mom, angry that they not only would take my phone, but that I would have to expose myself to a stranger. My mother convinced me to admit myself, and so I did. The staff in the unit were nice enough, but I could tell they thought my case was not that bad. There were people in the unit being constantly monitored in case of a seizure; my hands were not even shaking as the alcohol wore off. I sat in a chair and watched movies, paced around, called my mother from the only phone in the room. Seven hours later, I was able to drive and they discharged me, at which point I drove home and drank some more."
