        "Summarize the following story in first person: When Mary called me from Nebraska in early June she sounded as pleasant and straightforward as her name. She had seen my wedding photography site online, and wanted to find out what it would cost to hire me to photograph her October wedding on the Northern California coast. I told her what I would charge to drive up north from my home in San Francisco and photograph her wedding. She sighed.\"That's just way out of our budget, what with the travel and hotels and everything. I'm really sorry to have bothered you.\"It seemed like a long way to come to get married if she didn't have much money. I was curious. \"Why don't you tell me a bit more about your plans and we'll talk about the price later?\"\"Well, we're trying to keep things simple. The important thing is that my fianc\u00e9, Tom, just got back from Iraq a few months ago. He grew up in California, and he used to go to a beach out there with his grandfather in the summers. His grandfather passed away while he was in Iraq, and I know it means a lot to him to get married near that same beach. So we're just going to make it happen somehow. We've booked the Rotary Club near there for afterwards and our parents will do all the cooking and decorating and stuff. It'll be fine. Pictures were sort of extra, I guess. I just really thought it would be nice to have some. For later, I mean.\"Lately I'd been photographing too many weddings that felt more like theatrical productions with a cast of three-hundred-and fifty and featuring every kind of over-the-top excess. It was far too long since I'd documented a ceremony that felt truly meaningful \"I'd love to photograph your wedding,\" I told her. \"Let's figure out a price you can work with.\" I sent her a contract to sign, and we were all set.In October Mary called again. It was just a couple of days before she and Tom were due to drive to California.\"I wanted to check in with you about a few things,\" she said. \"I'm not sure if I told you that my dad is performing the ceremony.\"\"That must be really nice for you.\"\"Yes, it is.\" She hesitated a moment before going on. \"He's just about the sweetest man you'll ever meet. It's really different for him that we're getting married at the beach and not at his church, but he's been great about it.\"\""

I'm just really excited and really nervous. I'm so glad you're here to help us with the pictures.\"\"I'm here for you,\" I said. \"I'll see you in a couple of days.\"It was just after dawn on the day of the wedding when I arrived at the beach. Mary and Tom were already there, standing on the sand and looking out at the ocean. They looked happy and peaceful, and the sunrise was a perfect backdrop for them. The ceremony was beautiful, with Mary's father leading the way and Tom's grandfather's ashes scattered into the waves at the end. The reception was just as simple and meaningful, with all of the people who mattered most to the couple gathered around them to celebrate their love.\""
