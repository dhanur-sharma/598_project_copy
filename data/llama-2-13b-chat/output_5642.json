        "Summarize the following story in first person: Two months ago I had to take a tech program examination.  My standing at work was under challenge by other people in my company.  If I didn't pass the test I would have been demoted and I would have had my pay lowered.  I didn't want that so I tried my best to pass it.  It was an extremely stressful time.  I wasn't afforded much time to prepare for the test, not even a day.  It was sprung on me at a moment's notice.  I was worried that I wasn't going to make it on time to the test.  I managed to make it there.  When I sat down I got right to work.  I started to calm down when I noticed that the questions were things I was very familiar with.  This gave me confidence that I needed at the time.  When the exam was finally done I was relieved.  Later that week I found out the results of the exam, and I had passed.  I was able to keep my social standing and position in the company.  My boss and my co-workers congratulated me for passing."
