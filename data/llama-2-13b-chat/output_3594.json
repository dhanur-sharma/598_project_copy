        "Summarize the following story in first person: It is one thing to drop off one child at college but to drop off your last, is a whole other experience.  Especially when you drop two off at once and go from an active busy household to a quiet dull home. Our kids were excited to go off to college. It was a busy fun summer.  Made even busier towards the end with preparing the kids to return to school.  One going back to her senior year the other to his sophomore year. Lucky for us they attend the same school, which does seem to make events like this a little easier. I can not imagine having to take them to other sides of the United Staes to go to school ,with different climates different start dates, different holidays..  That would be hard .  It is nice to know your children were returning to the schools they choose to attend. They were returning to an enivornment they knew. They were going back to the arms of friends and even teachers they knew and had grown to care for. The drive home was long. The empty car held no chatter bugs. No one fighting over In N' Out or Chick filet. The radio didn't even play.  Silence. Upon my return to the empty house I was content knowing they were happy where they were."
