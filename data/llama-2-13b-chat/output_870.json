        "Summarize the following story in first person: We got to the wedding around 10 am and I started taking the pictures before the the wedding. Everybody was setting up the stuff and I ended up taking the dresses with out the husband seeing them so I could take pictures of them first. I then took some pictures of the groom men and then the bride and the bride maids. I took a few of the maid of honor and the groom together. I took some pictures of the reception and the bride and groom together where the couldn't see themselves. I then went back to where the bride was and took some of them her getting ready. I then went back in the church where she was having her wedding and waited and made sure I had my camera ready to take there pictures coming in. I then started taking pictures of the wedding party and they looked so beautiful and it was a very pretty wedding. I then waited on the bride to come in and I started taking pictures of her and the groom and there very first moments together. Then after the wedding I started taking pictures of the whole wedding party and the mother and father of the groom and bride. We then went over to the reception and I started taking pictures there when everybody came in and it was so beautiful. The bride and groom had there first dance and where they cut the cake and I took pictures of everybody that was eating and dancing. We then went outside and I took pictures of then driving off in an old nice jeep. I ended up leaving very late and taking the little ones home and watching them till everybody left. It was a fun and beautiful nice day for a wedding."
