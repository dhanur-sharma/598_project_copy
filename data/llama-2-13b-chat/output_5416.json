        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was a mere 12 weeks away from my Bachelors in Elementary Education. All that was required was my student internship, which involved me working full time at an elementary school in my area under a supervising teacher. The internship would allow me to apply what I'd learned in my classes while getting real life experience and guidance from an experienced teacher. The only downside to this was that the internship was unpaid, so I had to leave my job for 3 months. I'd known about this for a while, so I planned ahead and had money set aside to get me through until I graduated. Unfortunately, once I started my internship, life decided to intervene. It seemed like every week there was a new emergency that required me to dip into my savings, and by week 6, I was totally broke. I ran the numbers and realized that if I'd stayed in my internship and finished it, I would be so behind on rent and car payments that I would probably have lost both. Being a husband and a father, I wasn't willing to risk that, so I quit my internship and went back to work. Doing this forced me to change my major and lose about a year of credits in the process. The process of getting back in school also took about 4 months, but I got back to it about 35 credits less than what I had before. The whole experience made me feel like a total failure. Walking back into work 6 weeks early and having to answer everybody's questions about why I was back so soon was humiliating. I felt like I let my family down. I felt like I let myself down. I felt frustrated because I'd done everything right; I'd planned ahead and put money aside, worked hard in class, and did everything I had to do, but no matter what I did I still found myself stuck. Even revisiting it now brings back a ton of emotions, and at this point I'm within months of graduating again, but to think of all the time lost and money wasted really stings."
