        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was thrown a 33rd birthday party by my children in September. They had planned it as a surprise party, and it included all of my favorite foods including carrot cake which is my favorite kind of cake. There was also hot wings and hot mustard sauce, which is another favorite of mines. I felt so proud, and honored. The little people i had raised all pulled together to organize something especially for me. Usually they are doing more fighting than working together. It moved me so much, that it brought tears to my eyes. y children seen how moved I was and also started to cry along with me. they had purple balloons all over,  and an separate table was filled with gifts just for me. I was able to sit at the head of the table in a chair that had ribbon taped to it. The chair felt special I felt special that day. I have never had anything this over the top for myself ever in my life. I often think about it. I often look back on all the photos that we took that night, and think \"I am so lucky\". The event made me feel as though I have raised some awesome children."
