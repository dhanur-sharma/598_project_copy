        "Summarize the following story in first person: I had an experience this spring that was both bad and surprisingly, good, in a way. At least I guess, a bad experience that turned out to have good consequences. I was mountain biking in April with a group of friends, as we do regularly. At the end of the ride it was getting on toward evening. As it got darker, I decided to ride back to my car on a dark stretch of the paved roadway. I missed seeing a dangerous hazard in the road and  wiped out badly with my mountain bike, and in the dark I couldn't see the pavement coming so I wasn't able to break the fall with my hands. Instead I slammed down on the pavement and gravel, taking the full brunt of the fall with my shoulder and clavical (collarbone).  As I lay there after the impact, I was stunned and in incredible pain. I don't know if I even cried out. I knew I was hurt - badly. For a time, maybe a few minutes - ? I don't know, time was suspended - For a time, I felt so very alone there in the dark with my injuries. Then, in a flurry, my riding pals were all around me, in a flurry of activity, taking care of me, comforting me and telling me they'd called 911 and help was on the way. The rest of the night went by as if in a movie - I remember flashes of different scenes, the lights of the ambulance, the ride to the hospital, the bright lights of the emergency room, doctors talking to me, nurses helping me....and my worried friends and the looks of concern on their faces. I was so touched by the love and concern they all showed to me. Never before had I felt so much care and human kindness directed toward me. It was a feeling that I have reflected on many times since."
