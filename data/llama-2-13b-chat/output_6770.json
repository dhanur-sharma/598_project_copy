        "Summarize the following story in first person: This story was about my bestie. These were the last words he said to me\u2026. You know what that \u201ctomorrow\u201d never came. X ( I am hiding the name ) was a good friend of mine. I first saw him in when I was in sixth standard. I guess he was a new admission in the school. He was very silent by nature. As I am a very talkative person so I always tried to persuade him to speak something. But he never changed his habit. Well that was too much annoying for me. Sorry, but I hate those people who always keep silent and don't express themselves. when he started to talk to me without my persuasion. He wasn't a brilliant guy so he often scored average in the exams. His desire to learn more brought him closer to me ( actually I was the topper of my class at that time. ) we became good friends there after. I was in eleventh standard when everything changed suddenly. I remembered that day he was very happy. He was talking to everyone and passing smiles to everyone in reply of a hello or hi. He was acting quite amusing that day. I didn't asked him the reason but I was happy to know he was enjoying his surroundings. Next day when I reached the school, I found that the environment of the class was quite disturbing. Almost everybody was standing in his own respective friend circle and was whispering. I sensed that something terrible has happened. When I enquired about the topic I was told that four of our school students who were coming to school on a motorcycle early in the morning have been brutally crushed by a truck. One of them had died while the rest are still unconscious."

Suddenly I heard someone calling my name. I turned back and saw him. He was lying on the floor. I ran towards him and saw that he was in a pool of blood. He was calling my name. I was crying and shouting for help. He told me that he loved me. I told him that I loved him too. He told me that tomorrow will be a better day. He closed his eyes and took his last breath. I was left alone with his dead body. I cried for him and for myself. I was not able to understand why god took him away from me. He was so young and had so much to live. I was feeling so helpless. I was not able to do anything to save him. I was just standing there with his dead body in my hands. I was crying so much that I was not able to see anything. After a long time I came to my senses and realized that I had to inform his parents about the incident. I called them and they were on their way"
