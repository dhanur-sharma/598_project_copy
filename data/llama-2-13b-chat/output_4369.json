        "Summarize the following story in first person: The event that really emotionally played a huge part of 2019 was my brother's wedding. The woman he is now married to is absolutely adorable, being my brother's best friend, this is so important to me. My brother didnt have the greatest relationship with my mom growing up.  I always worried he was going to be too cynical to get married. His wife supports him in every possible capacity so that is good for my heart and his too I'm sure! She is so supportive in fact that they got married on a boat because he loves fishing so much. The best part for me was watching them say their vows. I bawled like a baby, my best friend, my brother - married! Seeing the love on their faces really gave me home for my own future.  I never imagined I'd get married but now I lik at things differently now, thanks to them! The boat was big dinner boat, and they got married up on the deck. Helping set up and drcorate made me realize the beauty in simple things.  A single flower in a dish, a sprig of mint on a white clothe napkin. There was an open bar and catered good that was delicious. Champagne for everyone even non alcoholic for the kids. They had a beautiful ceremony which is a perfect but cost effective wedding.  I loved the photo opportunity the natural background created for us. Seeing my big brother this happy has been a blessing!"
