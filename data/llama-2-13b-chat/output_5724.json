        "Summarize the following story in first person: My girlfriend and I decided to book two plane tickets to Orlando, Florida and go to Disney World for the Weekend. Out plane took off in the morning from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and landed at approximately 11:00 am in Orlando, Florida. After we picked up our rental car we drove to the Grand Floridian Resort and Spa which is located on Disney's property to unpack our bags in the hotel room. With almost the entire day left we decided to go to the Magic Kingdom park. The most memorable experience was the first night when we both went to the Magic Kingdom park to watch the fireworks and light show displayed on and around Cinderella's Castle while eating our favorite ice cream from Main Street USA. After we watched the fireworks and light show we then decided to do some shopping in the nearby stores. We bought a few things and then decided to head back to the hotel room. We then has a magical two more days at Disney World that was full of fun memories we will never forget. When it was out last night we ended up in Epcot where we got to travel around the world to the several different countries. The next day we packed out bags and started driving towards the airport to catch our flight. We were laughing and smiling all the way back to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It was the best trip we had ever taken and we can't wait to go back soon. Disney will always be a very special place in our hearts. We constantly talk about this trip to our friends and family and encourage them to also take a spontaneous trip with their significant other because it is like no other. Hollywood Studious park just announced they are releasing the opening date for Star Wars meaning it may be fun to fly down the weekend it opens. Overall, everything from the fireworks and light show with ice cream to fabulous milkshakes and traveling around the world in Epcot was an amazing experience."
