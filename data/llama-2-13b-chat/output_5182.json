        "Summarize the following story in first person: A few months ago I experienced something very memorable it involved an altercation with some thugs trying to fight me and vandalize my property. It all started when my brother was coming home from school and a group of kids tried to bank him. I heard it happening outside my house and ran after them but counldnt catch up to them. I found one of the boys bag to try and find his name and address but didnt find anything. The thugs got away but the next day or two the one boy didnt like that i messed with his bag so he came with two others and threw a rock towards my window and it broke. I heard this happen and quickly got my shoes on and ran after the thugs. I caught up to them in an alley way. It was only 2 at first but it quickly became around 15. I started to asked them why they broke my window but they just wanted to fight me. Conti ued to try and talk to them until they started to surround me and then i started running. However I could not outrun them. The thugs caught me and started punching and kicking me until my neighbor came and yelled them away. I called the police and they arrived like 15 mins later. What really surprised me was that the police officer saw the thugs that commited the crime but did nothing to him. The officer just let him run away to go around doing did stuff to more innocent people."
