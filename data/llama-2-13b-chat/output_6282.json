        "Summarize the following story in first person: it was about six months ago when my youngest sister started getting sick. suddenly at first it started off as a cold and we took her to hospital but after being checked by the doctors she was diagnosed with malaria. so the doctors prescribed some medicines for us we went to the chemist and bought the medicines and then headed home. after a few days she started recovering. we were very happy and we resumed to living our lives just like before because now she was able to do some chores by herself and she later on started going back to school because she felt better again. After a few weeks i remember it was an evening we had taken our supper and we were all seated at the sitting room me, my younger sister,my dad and my mum watching some news on the television. suddenly my younger sister started complaining that she was feeling very cold my dad suggested that she should go and wear another sweater or bring a blanket and cover herself,she did just that and came back later on she started sweating. we were all very scared because she couldn't talk at all. my dad asked me to go and call the ambulance. as i went i found my mother crying not knowing what to do next. i called the ambulance and after some few minutes the ambulance came and she was rushed to the hospital. we were not allowed all of us to board the ambulance so we followed from behind with our vehicle. When we reached the hospital she had been rushed to the emergency room. we were all worried because we had never seen her in such a situation. we waited for almost 45 minutes without hearing a word from the doctors. After some few more years the doctor came out and told us that our sister was in a very delicate state and she had just died. just hearing that my mum fainted and i don't remember what happened next because when i woke up i was lying on the hospital bed. i started crying because i just watched her die without helping her out.. it was a very disturbing moment for me and my family until now we are still mourning"
