        "Summarize the following story in first person: It started out as an innocent-enough day. I went to work like normal, and got through most of the day without any abnormal occurences. Then I received a text from my ex, and my mood instantly went downhill. It had been an abusive relationship, and scary breakup. I thought I had finally gotten free. When I left work, I decided to alleviate some stress by stopping at a little bar. I figured I'd have a couple of drinks and some food, and take my mind off things a little bit. After being seated for just a couple of minutes, the bartender came over. This drink is from the guy at the end, she said. I thought to myself that this is interesting, since no guy had ever bought me a drink before. We ended up talking for hours, and before I knew it I was feeling pretty good. I told myself that I deserved to relax though, and I was safe to drive. On the way home, it all started to hit me. However I only lived 2 miles away and knew that I could make it. Suddenly I saw a bright flash of light, heard screeching, and then nothing. I awoke in the emergency room with a concussion and severely fractured arm. Now, on top of ex problems, I'd have to take time off work. Definitely a lesson learned."
