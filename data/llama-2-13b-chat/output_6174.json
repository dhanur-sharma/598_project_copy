        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was up for a promotion at work. I gathered my portfolio of past accomplishments and things i'm currently working on and went over them so i could present them to the person interviewing me. There were a few of us interviewing for the role and were excited to be interviewed. I had my interview, presented my portfolio, discussed at length, my qualifications for the job and discussed the role as well. It was a lengthy interview. I saw this as a good thing. It was good conversation with talks about work, how we approach work, how we approach adversity, things of that nature. I learned a lot about the company; much more than I had already learned. It took a few days but i was offered the position. This person had considerable power over me in that i wanted this job and they would be the one deciding who received the promotion. I was excited and proud to be chosen and for the new role. It brought many new responsibilities and challenges but i was ready for them. I felt that i had worked hard for this promotion and it filled me with pride to have gotten it. I was looking forward to the new role and couldn't wait to get started. It had been a long time coming. I felt I was quite deserving of the new role."
