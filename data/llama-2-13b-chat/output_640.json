        "Summarize the following story in first person: Three months ago, I woke up to find my mom lying in her bed. She wouldn't get up. Her skin was blue and cold. I have never felt anything like the horror that came over me when I realized she was dead--to be honest, I kind of blacked out mentally and don't remember exactly what occurred, but I don't think I'll ever forget how hopeless and terrified I felt in that moment. I looked over to her nightstand and saw a note, she couldn't deal with the pain, the loneliness, it had all become too much for her, but really the details don't matter, do they? The end result is the same, my mom is gone, she took her own life. I felt abandoned, I felt alone, I felt guilty--was I not enough? Was there something I missed? Could anything have gone differently if I had done this or that? We can't change the past, but we sure can feel anxiety about it. I couldn't undo what she had done, but I felt like she needed to matter in some way, that I needed to show her an interest and love that maybe if I had shown her in life this terrible thing would have never happened. I decided to use this as an opportunity to learn more about her life, which of course tied in with my life, my history, my heritage. We had never been too close to most of our family, we lived across the country from the majority of them, I didn't have any way to contact a lot of these people, who were total strangers to me. I ordered a DNA kit online and was able to get the names of some of them. We ended up connecting online, and I learned I had aunts, cousins, even a grandfather--I was still lost in a dark tunnel, but now I felt like I wasn't so alone. I ended up connecting with one of my cousins via social media and I'm going to be flying across the country to go see them in just a few months. I was able to hear stories about my mother's childhood and it was like finding a whole new facet of her that I never would have learned in life. I wish that she was still here with me, but I feel like I am honoring her memory while discovering things about both her and myself, even if she is not here to see it."
