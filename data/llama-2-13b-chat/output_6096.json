        "Summarize the following story in first person: Today was a rough day.  I worked a long shift that had a lot of difficult people come into my world.  All I wanted to do today was come home, get in comfy clothes and read a book.  God had a different plan for me today, that's for sure.  When I left work this afternoon the weather was horrible.  Pouring rain, thunder, wind....you name it.  It was very hard to see the road.  I was on Beecher Ave and the car in front of my hydroplaned and ran off into the woods.  I couldn't believe it.  It was a horrible sight!  I for sure thought whoever was in the car was badly injured.  I pulled over to help at the scene.  I called 911 and ran to the car.  There was an elderly woman in the driver's seat.  She had her seat belt on, thank goodness, and only had injuries from impact.  Her car was completely wrecked though.  She was able to unbuckle herself and get out of the vehicle.  I sat with her until the police and ambulance arrived.  The poor woman was so shaken up.  All I wanted to do was hug her.  I felt horrible, but I was so glad I was there to comfort her and help her in her time of need."
