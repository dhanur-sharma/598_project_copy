        "Summarize the following story in first person: If I'm being honest, I really do not like flying on an airplane. I realize compared to the risk of riding in a car the chance of a crash happening is statistically lower, but not in my opinion. I do not think something that size has any business being in the air and basically propelled by fire. This is all beside the point because three months ago I had no choice but to get on a plane to attend my company's annual event. This year it was at the state's capitol. I'm glad it doesn't take place at the same location every year, so that's a positive aspect. I rarely visit the capitol so at least a bit of excitement was added to the mandatory plane trip. I would have preferred at least one night's stay in a decent hotel instead of having to fly back on the same day. That is way too much flying for me and maybe even most people. It felt like a waste of resources and there could have been a better, less wasteful alternative to the entire event. It's difficult to say whether or not I had a good time considering I spend the entire day being anxious about traveling on two different airplanes. If the annual event next year is two plane trips in one day, I may have to find a way out of it. I don't think I could handle another stressful travel day like this one. Speaking of stressful, my nerves were so shot from the traveling I decided once I landed I needed a stiff drink or several to take the edge off. Thankfully I arrived home safely and as soon as I got off the plane, I was calling my best friend. I didn't want to go out for a drink alone. Luckily she was considering going out for a few drinks anyway and hadn't found anyone to go with. We met up at our favorite local bar and had quite a few drinks. We eventually became exhausted and it was late anyway, so we shared a cab so we could safely get home. I'm glad she was able to join me. To my surprise the day turned around because my evening with her was so enjoyable."
