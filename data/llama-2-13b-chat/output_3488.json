        "Summarize the following story in first person: Around 3 months ago, I ended the relationship between my partner and I. Things between us, though initially exciting, felt stale and disingenuous. On our last night together, my partner was behind the wheel. After some time passed, I turned to them and said quietly, \"I think I would like to go home.\" They were silent, but abruptly obliged. Only, they started driving really recklessly. They were going too fast, cursing under their breath. I felt really afraid. I'd never seen them react like that. They insisted they were fine, their behavior behind the wheel said otherwise, however. Once we reached my house, I said quietly, \"I don't think this is working.\" I exited the car and never saw them again. Our relationship never dove past the surface. I am curious, playful, I like to ask questions, pontificate about life, our purpose, the world.  We didn't share that quality. They are stern, emotionless, robotic. Often met my musings with silence or a blank stare."
