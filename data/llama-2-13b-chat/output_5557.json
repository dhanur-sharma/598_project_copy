        "Summarize the following story in first person: I created a story in my mind that he couldn\u2019t love me the way I needed to be loved. I told myself that I wanted something he couldn\u2019t give. There is some truth to that, but that\u2019s not the full story. To find some healing, I had to own my part in the creation of my experience. I knew who he was when I met him. He was the one who was safe and secure. He was also reserved and structured. He was the guy every parent would want their daughter to marry. I ignored the fact that there was very little spontaneity or passion in his life and in our relationship. I didn\u2019t question the absence of those ingredients. I did what I was supposed to do, hid my heart, kept myself busy and distracted, kept myself from getting hurt. I made that trade-off and, to a certain degree, it served me. Let me say that again\u2026It. Served. Me. I could stay hidden \u2013 making my life look picture-perfect \u2013 and in doing so, possibly avoid the judgment of others and being hurt by someone I might have really allowed into my heart. But every bit of that was my fears, my mask, and my choices. For me, in the end, it was still the right decision to release that marriage, but I wish I would have known everything I know today before I made that decision, because I would have handled things differently and certainly, more gently. Not as many people would have been hurt or impacted in the process."
