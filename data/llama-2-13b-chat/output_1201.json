        "Summarize the following story in first person: 3 months ago, I moved out of my old town into a new city. I had lived in my college town for a year after graduating, and in total I had lived there for 6 years. It's a small town, and all of my friends and people I knew had moved away. I finished a music degree and had applied to some graduate programs because I didn't know what else to do. Luckily, I did not get in to any program, and I felt an immense sense of relief when I was forced out of this path I had made for myself. Thought I was relieved, I didn't know what to do with myself, and I quickly fell into a rut. I felt very mentally and physically stuck in a place that started feeling foreign to me. I made the decision to move to a new city, and I saved enough to make a deposit on an apartment. I spent weeks packing all of my belongings, and this was particularly stressful because I was also dealing with a mouse infestation. I rented a truck and put everything inside, then drove to my new home. I was scared of leaving a familiar place and moving somewhere where I didn't know anyone or even have a job yet. After I unpacked my belongings into the new apartment, I returned the truck and went to the grocery store. Even that felt foreign to me since I had been going to the same few in my small college town for years. I got enough food to eat for a while and went home to make dinner. The new apartment and new city didn't feel like home, but my old town definitely didn't either. I felt a lack of belonging on that night, and though it was scary, it was very liberating to not be surrounded by old attachments and memories. I felt free from some old patterns and able to start fresh. This was the first move I had made on my own."
