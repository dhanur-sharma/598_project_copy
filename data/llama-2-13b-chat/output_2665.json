        "Summarize the following story in first person: In the last three to six months the most memorable event I had was turning the legal and tender age of twenty-one years old. My friends had convinced me that I need to plan a girls' getaway trip to Atlanta, Georgia to celebrate. I obliged and soon we were off to the party capital of the southeastern United States. I spared literally no expense, because I wanted to be comfortable and have great posts for my social media profiles such as Facebook and Instagram. Therefore the trip went something like this. The very first day of the trip we checked into our hotel and immediately ordered room service. My friends chose the more expensive dishes like steak and potatoes. I however opted to get the seafood platter since I myself am a native Marylander. We then went clubbing into the wee hours of the morning. They convinced a couple of guys to buy us drinks and I ended up making out with one really handsome dude in particular. He gave me his phone number and said we should meet up the next day. The very next day though my friends made plans to go sightseeing downtown. I cut out early to meet with this guy. We had a lot in common so we continued to hang out at a local bar and dance club into the wee hours of the evening. He told me his car was in the shop and asked if I could drop him off at his home. I agreed naively, assuming this guy was telling me the truth. He said he did not want to sleep with me on the first night because he is a traditional dude. 'Once we arrived at his house we started to make out in the car in front of his home.  By the time we were done I saw little hands hitting my passenger side car window. There was a small child calling me a tramp and telling me not to kiss his father. I asked him what was going on and he said I was not supposed to find out like this. I replied, \"Like what?\" He then said he forgot to mention that he had a wife and a family. He wanted to ask me without all the drama if I would be complicit in being his girlfriend though. I replied that I absolutely would not and drove away. I could not stop crying the entire evening until the time I left Atlanta two days later."
