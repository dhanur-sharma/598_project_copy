        "Summarize the following story in first person: My uncle just passed away three weeks ago. It was incredibly unexpected and surprising for me and my family. He had only went into the hospital about two weeks prior. Two days prior to his death, he went to a rehab facility and they even expected him to be able to go home in about a week. Everyone thought he was going to be okay, but he suddenly took a turn for the worst. He was a heavy drinker, but no one saw his sudden death coming. I was a bit upset and it caused me a significant amount of stress because my parents and I are his only family. We are the ones left to sort everything out and pay for the minimal funeral expenses. He didn\u2019t have a will. He didn't have many assets and certainly no cash to help us with the costs. All he had was us and a share of my grandmother's house. I am still so stressed from cleaning up the mess of a sudden death. I haven't had a break or time to relax in weeks. I don't even think I've had time to cope. I hope we've handled everything well."
