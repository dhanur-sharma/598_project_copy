        "Summarize the following story in first person: I had been dating my girlfriend for 8 months when we decided that we wanted to move in together. Once we found a place of our own, I had to tell my current roommate about my intentions to move out. I gave her 7 weeks notice, which is quite a generous amount of time given the legal obligation in most states of only 30 days. She had initially received it pretty well, but left abruptly about an hour after I told her. She came back drunk in the middle of the night and proceeded to bang on my door while I was sleeping saying that we needed to talk. She then proceeded to tell me how I wasn't a good friend and how a decent person would have \"given her all the time she needed to find a new roommate.\" Among the laundry list of disparaging comments was the insult that I was effectively screwing her over while she was attempting to extort several months rent out of me. After doing a bit of legal homework, I learned that she had no leverage against me and told her I was only obligated to give her 30 days notice. She blew up my phone with phone calls and text messages insulting and demeaning me and I haven't made direct contact with her since. I had since been staying at my girlfriend's house during the transition and when I first returned to my apartment in the following weeks I found all of my belongings that were in the shared common area had been ransacked and shoved into my room. The irony of this, was that my roommate said that she did not trust me with her belongings, but she felt she had the right to go through my things. Upon inspection, I found that all of my books were removed from the living room bookshelf and tossed onto my bed. Another time I returned to find that all of my kitchen belongings that I intended to pack up were thrown casually on the floor. Later the same night I got a text message from my former roommate saying that she expected me to clear out ASAP despite still being within the thirty day period of rent that I paid for my last month. The situation has escalated to a point where I no longer feel comfortable associating with this person face to face and have taken active measures to avoid her at all costs. The best part of the whole thing was that I was spending considerably less and less time at my apartment and she even admitted to seeing it coming, but she still didn't take active measures and acted out in this manner."
