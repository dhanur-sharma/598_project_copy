        "Summarize the following story in first person: I am a 42 year old female, who lives in Alabama. I am an elementary school teacher and have just completed my Master's degree. I have recently become the mother of FIVE children. My oldest, a boy, is currently serving in the Army as a Combat Medic. I divorced his father when he was two. I remarried (my current husband) and went on to have three children (ages 8, 4, and 3). I recently gave birth to our fourth child (my fifth) three months ago. The birth of my daughter has been such an incredible event. Knowing that she is definitely 100% my last baby has been hard to handle, but I'm very thankful to have her. My oldest son (he's 20, almost 21) got married last December to a girl he met at AIT. They came home to Alabama this past Saturday to have a wedding and reception, even though they were already married. I also found out I am going to be a grandma in March. My baby girl is going to be nine months older than her nephew/niece. This pregnancy was not so much a surprise as I didn't think it would happen. I figured I was too old to get pregnant, so my husband and I weren't as careful as we should have been. After my son was born three years ago, I secretly longed for another baby. I really hoped I would have one more girl, so I was not upset when I got pregnant. The pregnancy was the hardest one yet. Maybe because I'm a lot older or maybe because I gained 50 pounds. Maybe because I had three other children, ages 8 and younger. I didn't want to tell anyone about the pregnancy, first because I thought something ba would happen or something might be wrong with the baby. Second, I was embarrassed about having a baby at my age and because she would be number five. We didn't tell family until 22 weeks and everyone else until 27 weeks. I have a little cheated that I didn't celebrate this pregnancy or baby more. That time is gone and I'll never get it back."
