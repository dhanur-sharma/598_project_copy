        "Summarize the following story in first person: My mother bought me a new laptop unexpectedly. I really needed one and mine had recently been stolen. Someone had taken it while I went to the bathroom at a coffee shop. I ignorantly thought it would be safe there since I came there all of the time. I just knew I would have to work extra hours to be able to afford a new laptop. When my mom bought me another computer I was shocked and so happy. I cried tears of joy. I was so touched and grateful. This was a truly a moment of real happiness for me because it meant a lot to me. My mom did not have to do this for me at all. I am so happy that I have my new laptop and I will of course make sure to take care of it. I am never going to leave my laptop unattended ever again. I think that I learned a huge valuable lesson here.  That lesson was to not be so trusting. I also don't need to be so naive as well. I really am grateful for this moment."
