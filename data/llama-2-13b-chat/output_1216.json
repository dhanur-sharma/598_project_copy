        "Summarize the following story in first person: My teaching practicum this year has been mostly uneventful and not at all difficult. I was feeling quite optimistic in my ability to become a good teacher, based on my experience thus far in the practicum. That is, until three weeks ago when a male student I am particularly fond of approached me before class and shared a personal situation that is causing him much anguish, making it difficult to concentrate on what's happening in the classroom and on his studies in general. He clearly came to me for comfort and reassurance, which I deeply felt moved to provide. Then he did such an odd and alarming thing, it has stayed in my mind and worried me ever since: he gave me a photograph of himself. He said he wanted me to have it \"to remember him by.\"  Now I often find myself lying awake at night wondering if he just wanted me to remember him after my practicum is finished and I am no longer in his classroom, or if there is some darker, more ominous message in his gesture. There was a time in my life when I was so despairing I thought I couldn't go on living. Fortunately there was a very kind and wise psychologist who worked as a counselor at my high school and I had the presence of mind to take myself to see her. I credit her with helping me not only stay in school, but keep my grades up, study for the SAT, and send in my college applications. Having access to help can make all the difference in a young person's life. I have placed his photo on the mirror that hangs above my dresser, where I see it every morning and evening. Each time I wonder, could he be contemplating suicide? Surely I am being alarmist and reading too much into it, yet, the question will not go away.  I ask myself, what is my responsibility in this situation? Most importantly, how would a truly great teacher handle this? Finally, last night, after lying awake yet again with worry, I made the decision to speak to his teacher, in confidence, about the incident and my concern. I will ask not to tell him that I said anything or to do anything that would cause him to suspect I had, but I realize that may prove difficult. In the end, what matters is making sure he is safe from self-harm and has someone to talk to and a place to get help. I also hope to learn from this teacher, who has impressed me with her teaching style, how a good teacher manages such delicate matters as a student with a serious problem outside the classroom.  I am going to talk to her today after class. I am committed now to this course of action and praying it is the right one."
