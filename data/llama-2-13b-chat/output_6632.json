        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last week the craziest thing happened to me.  One of my friends suggested going for a bike ride along the trails.  It was finally a nice clear day out and we both had off from work.  We were catching up on what's been happening in our lives, and a deer shot across the trail.  It was very beautiful.  I'm used to seeing chipmunks and squirrels, but I didn't think I would see any deer.  As we were a couple miles in, we crossed a bridge.  I don't think I am afraid of heights, but what happened really changed my mind.  As I was going over the bridge, I looked down and the distance was so great. It really freaked me out.  Right behind me, another biker passed me, as I was trying to be extra cautious.  It was so scary.  The bridge reminded me of the bridges you see in fun houses that are shaky.  Seeing my friend on the other side of the bridge helped a lot.  She gave me confidence and encouraged me.  I am glad she was with me.  I don't think I would have crossed the bridge if she wasn't."
