        "Summarize the following story in first person: It's been 5 months since I lost her but I still think about Granny Ma every day.  I remember when I was a child, Granny Ma would take me to the zoo.  I would sit in the back of the car and make animal noises during the entire drive.  Granny Ma would try to guess which animal I was but most of her guesses were always wrong.  When I told her which animal I was, she would tell me how smart I am.  I remember her long curly hair and how we would sit in front of the bathroom mirror as she would brush it out.  She would tell me how important it was to brush slowly in order to keep the hair healthy.  The thing I remembered the most was her smell.  Her home was a like a jasmine garden mixed with warm scents of vanilla and tea.  Everywhere she went left a trail of floral aroma.  It was such a pleasant, comforting smell.  I remember the last time I saw Granny Ma.  Five months ago I was sitting at the foot of the hospital bed.  Granny Ma was covered in tubes, monitors, and wires.  She would lay and smile at me with such soft eyes.  Her hand rested on mine as I would tell her stories of our trips to the zoo, how much I loved her homemade pies, and memories of listening to her play the flute.  I told her about our walks around the community park and how I would light up when I could smell her perfume.  Granny Ma told me how lucky she was to have me in her life and how happy she was to experience it all.  Granny Ma told me that she never had any regrets during her life and wouldn't change a thing.  That night Granny Ma went to sleep forever and the most amazing woman is now blessing Heaven with her heavenly scent.  I still miss her."
