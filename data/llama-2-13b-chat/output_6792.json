        "Summarize the following story in first person: My parents were reported to us siblings, by neighbors, that they were not doing well mentally and physically recently. My father was in the ER with reported confusion and having lost weight. Concerned I decided to leave work and drive the 2 hours to the ER to find out what was going on. My father was dehydrated and that was the cause of his confusion. Neighbors reported him also driving erratically with them in the car on the way to breakfast, and on other occasions. My siblings and I decided if things were to get bad, we needed to intervene to protect them. I decided that since I was unmarried, and in the Medical profession that I would leave my job and condo (in my son's hands) and move 2 hours to live with and care for them. This all happened within 2 months of the neighbors report. After about a year of living in this small town, my oldest brother decided to give me a gift. He granted me a trip of a lifetime to Ireland for 3 weeks. He and my sister would cover for me while I was gone. He knew that I had always wanted to go.  My other brother and sister-in-law were heading up the trip for students to go (for college credit) through the University where they were teaching. I was so touched by his generosity that I could not even speak to describe how I was feeling. I was so beyond grateful that he was doing this for me it was difficult to put into words just how excited I was to go. I knew that I would never have been able to afford to go on my own."
