        "Summarize the following story in first person: Six months ago, I made the huge decision to move out of my parents\u2019 home and into my own place. I lived in the same house since I was born and have two younger sisters who are in high school. I went to a college out-of-state but returned home for breaks. I had graduated college three months before (nine months ago) and landed a steady full-time salaried job four weeks after graduation. Since I was living at home, my expenses were generally low and I saved up a good amount of money. I started out looking for one-bedroom apartments around my city that I knew I could comfortably afford each month. I didn\u2019t tell my parents I was starting the apartment search and they hadn\u2019t asked about any timeline for doing so. I was concerned that my parents would be sad that I was leaving home as we are very close and I help out with my sisters. However, I was tired of not having privacy to spend time with my long-time boyfriend. I was also bothered every night to spend time with my family after I returned home from a long day at work and just wanted to relax. It was time to spread my wings and put down new roots of my own. After looking at three apartments, I decided on a very nice remodeled building with a parking space for my car and large windows with lots of light and closet space. I signed the papers and put down the deposit, still without talking to my parents. The next day, I sat down with them at dinner while my sisters were out at school activities and gently treaded the waters of telling them I was thinking of moving out to see how they would respond before giving them all the details. I waited for frowns or tears but both of them stood up and hugged me. They asked if I needed any help or recommendations for a new place but I explained that I already found one and would be moving in two weeks. They were surprised, but overjoyed. They told me I was a good daughter and deserved to have my own space and make my mark on the world. They helped me move and my mom was thrilled to help decorate. I am still close with my parents but now without being in such close quarters, I feel we can have a more adult relationship."
