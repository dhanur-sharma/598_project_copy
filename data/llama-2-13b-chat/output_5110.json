        "Summarize the following story in first person: My mom has smoked cigarettes for as long as I can remember. When I was a child, I use to take her cigarettes and crush them. I would then throw them in the garbage.  As I got older, I would always beg my mom to quit smoking. I knew that smoking was bad for her health. I wanted my mom to be around for as long as she could. I didn't want her to get sick from smoking.  My mom resisted quitting for so long. She was so addicted, she smoked around three packs a day.  She recently moved in with her boyfriend. They both smoked. Once her boyfriend turned 60, he decided that he thought they should quit smoking. She agreed with him. I was so happy when she told me that they were going to quit together. I have been waiting my whole life for her to quit smoking. I know that she will feel amazing after all the ill affects of the smoke leave her body. I am so happy for her and her boyfriend."
