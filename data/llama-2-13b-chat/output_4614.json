        "Summarize the following story in first person: Basically my who family was going to meet up at  my uncles house for a cookout. For my mom that passed away 2 and half years ago. The cookout started around four something. It was a lot to prepare for actually so I help set up fans in different areas outside. This set up took place in back yard because it was really hot. Then I sat around and take to my cousin and my uncles wife which was pregnant at the time. Also my son was there with is first cousins playing in sandbox getting all dirty. So were doing all this while the food is being grilled  so we could eat. Then after everyone arrived we wanted to do a balloon release in memory of my mom. We all gather on the side of house with our balloons and we prayed and said some loving things. Then we counted down and let the balloons go and watch as they float up to sky to see how far they would go. Which was really high without popping I felt like she was watching they floated all together. I wanted to cry but I held it in. Eventually the food was done so we lined up fix kids food first then ours. Then we all sat together and conversant and laugh. Finally by night time my aunt brought the cake out to show us and after that we just linger around till we got tired and ready to go."
