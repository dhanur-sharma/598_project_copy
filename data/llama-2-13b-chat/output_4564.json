        "Summarize the following story in first person: About a week ago i decided to drive up to the mountain, take my class and attempt the summit of Mount Hood. Although, I must say things were not looking all that good as far as the weather goes and leading up to our trip there were a few bumps in the road. I was packed, lunches and dinners were packed, so we were pretty much ready to go at this point. My wife went with me to keep me company when I wasn't on the mountain. There was just a couple of problems, we were going to get a few groceries before we left and the night prior, we were in a rush to get to work and forgot the list. Not to mention, I had forgotten to give my pager back before I left work. Not just any pager, but the pager that is reserved for medical emergencies at the hospital. So we made a trip back in (about a 1 hour drive, round trip) to return the pager and to get our groceries. By this time we were very tired, we had both worked a twelve hour shift prior to this and we were hoping to leave by around 3pm or 4 pm. This did not happen. We did not get home until about 1pm, so we were going to sleep until about 5 o'clock. Well we didn't get on our way until about 9pm. Arriving at the hotel at about 1am on Tuesday Morning, we were exhausted. Sleep came fairly quickly, knowing that I had to be up early the same morning to meet Brett at our hotel and and to take our beginner snow skills class. Climbing up the South Side of Mount HoodMeeting our guide and deciding whether or not to climb - Brett and I arrived early with plenty of time to meet Joe, our guide. Joe gave us an introduction of himself and his experience, checked our gear, asked us about our experience with climbing, had us sign the waivers that say if we die that they cannot be held liable. He then gave us the option, due to questionable weather to postpone the summit day for another time with better weather or to go ahead and try anyways the next day. After a short discussion, we decided to go ahead with it. After all we didn't want to have to make another long drive up to the mountain, and even if we didn't make the summit, we would still gain some experience, albeit expensive. Onward to the class we went. We learned how to kick steps, plunge step, self arrest techniques, traversing and the french step. We also learned several knots and proper roped travel. I must say I'm glad we drove up to Vermont last week. I saw beautiful foliage by a lake, in a field and from a gondola ride to the top of a mountain."
