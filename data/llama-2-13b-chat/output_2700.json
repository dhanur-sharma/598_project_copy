        "Summarize the following story in first person: That was such an awesome day! I can still remember the feeling of my face being stretched in the biggest smile possible - I was grinning like crazy when I was awarded the first place. It was such an amazing validation of the hard work I had put in and the determination I applied to this whole thing. I had started to do it just to keep in shape and because I thought it would be more fun than running or something like that. And then I started really liking it and discovered that I actually had a natural talent for it. The moves came naturally to me and I have quick reflexes so it all worked really well. I got into the competition because my instructor asked a few of us to do so but I was not eyeing the first place, not at all. I just went for the experience and to make my instructor happy. And even once I realized that the level of the competition was not impossibly high for me, I still did not focus on winning, but rather on doing the best I could. And I think that's what made winning it such a great learning experience for me: that you don't need to be obsessed with victory, but rather give it your best. It was very comforting to realize that. You see so many people who crave victory at all costs and who are so competitive, that it sometimes obscures the meaning of accomplishment and success. After the competition I felt so secure and confident. And not mostly because I had won, but rather because it validated that hard work and dedication were the way to go. And it's something I'm good at - I work a lot when I want to get better at something. It kind of makes me feel grounded and I like it. It gives me a lot of trust in what I can accomplish, and it makes the work I invest in it feel meaningful."
