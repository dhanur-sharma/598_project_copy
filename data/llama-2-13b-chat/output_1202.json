        "Summarize the following story in first person: I had been unhappy with my job for over a year at that point. I had frequently thought about quitting but it was hard to find time to look for a new job with all of the responsibilites I had. I thought that I could find a better job. And I thought that I deserved better pay and more time off. Still I found it hard to actually apply for other jobs and go on interviews while doing my current job, doing housework, and exercising. I would get worked up and think that this was the end for me, that I was going to leave very soon. But then I would ease back into my job and take comfort in the familiarity of it. I liked the people I work with and didn't really want to leave them. Finally though I knew that I needed to leave. I started looking at job postings online. I wasn't sure where to begin really and worried that I was wasting my time writing cover letters to a bunch of companies that may not even look at it. After applying to what seemed like 50 jobs I had a few interviews and eventually offers from two of them. I was happy to recieve job offers and at least know that I could leave my job if I wanted to. One of the offers was for slightly more money, but it offered 5 weeks of vacation. I value money and need money just in order to make my life easier, but I had never even considered how I could use that time off. At my old job I got 2 weeks of vacation and some years never even used all of it. Having 5 weeks of vacation seemed incredible and seemed like it would drastically lower my stress. I ended up taking the job. I was sad to elave behind my old coworkers and we promised to keep in touch, but I knew there was many of them that I wouldn't keep up with. I've met new firends on my job now and I'm starting to feel at home here. I think that I'll be really happy here and I wish that I would have left my old job sooner."
