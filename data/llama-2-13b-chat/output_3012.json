        "Summarize the following story in first person: Four months ago, this dramatic situation happened, guilt still invades me and memories frustrate me, beyond anyone who can try to comfort me. It's something like that, it is only understood by someone who has had to live it, others are only spectators who assume they know how it feels, but they really are not even close to imagining how it can feel. I fight a lot against this situation to be able to face it and eventually overcome it, since it is agonizing to live the feeling of guilt daily. I really hope to find the way out of this that haunts me. I need help. I never imagined that I would have to live my father's death, much less because of drugs. The funeral is very painful, seeing my broken mother fills me even more with sadness. My brothers are disconsolate, worried about what will come later. The absence of my father is something that will mark us all. I wish that nobody in the world used drugs, they have no idea of \u200b\u200bthe damage they do to their body. I hope that my story does not have to be lived by many other people, before becoming aware. My biggest refuge right now is God. I know that religion is a sensitive issue. I hope my father can at least enter the kingdom of heaven. I need a lot of strength to face the future without my father. For me the main thing now is my mother and my brothers."
