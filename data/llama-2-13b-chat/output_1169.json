        "Summarize the following story in first person: a memory i had would be, going to a baseball game with my kids and my husband. i didn't expect it to be that great,. the kids actually enjoyed themselves, we had great seats. right behind the plate and the kids got to run the bases after the game. they really enjoyed it and i was glad i would do something with my kids that they would enjoy . we first got there, they were really wowed at everything, they looked around and it was very load and music was playing . we got food, some popcorn and peanuts and then went down to our seats, shortly after the kids were pressed against the fence looking down at the field in amazement. after that the kids got kinda bored, then they had a little intermission and the kids got really happy when they started to play music, and started to dance and get happy and the mascot was entertaining the kids. a lad also was holding a camera filming the kids and putting them on the big screen. the kids got bored shortly after. so we took them upstairs. after that we let them walk around and take in the scene to keep them entertained. they had courses for kids to play on. like baseball running and a bouncy house, so we took them to that. after that they ran around the course in a circle for about 20 mins. we went to get peanuts after that. then we went back to our seats and my son got a ball. we ended up loosing it because he was throwing it in the stands. he was really sad about it. overall the game was good and we saw fireworks after the game ended."
