        "Summarize the following story in first person: Nearly two months ago, I had an unpleasant runin with someone at a restaurant. I was just minding my own business, eating breakfast and catching up on work emails. My day started out pleasant enough, as it was early in the day, quiet and peaceful. Then I notice some guy sits at the next booth and I sigh, annoyed that he doesn't seem interested in adhering to the basic social tenet of giving other people space in an otherwise large and empty restaurant. I can see out of the corner of my eye that he keeps turning his head to look back at me, and I brace myself for the inevitable encounter, probably another panhandler or some desperately lonely person looking for any type of social interaction, even with a complete stranger. My second theory turns out to be true, as he repeatedly turns in his seat to talk to me, succeeding in his attempts at insipid small talk while I give terse, disinterested answers. I live in the vain hope that my body language and preoccupation with my phone will eventually discourage him. I go to take a bite out of my breakfast sandwich and he turns around again, offering to buy me breakfast as he watches me chew. I stare at him, befuddled, finish chewing, swallow, and tell him no thank you before turning my attention to my phone, typing pointedly. He turns back, then minutes later turns back to me, and starts telling me a story about buying bread the other day. I have had it. I tell him I'm really not trying to be rude, but I'm just trying to eat my breakfast and take care of some work stuff. I wasn't in the mood to talk to anyone, sorry. He recoils, looks offended, and he repeatedly turns in his seat, then back at me petulantly, ranting about how he was just trying to be nice, he was just talking to me, I can't even be decent enough to talk to him? Because apparently I owe him conversation. I explain to him that I don't really care and to leave me alone. I can see a couple employees of the restaurant had sat down at one point, on break and/or checking in to see what was going on. I can see them watching quietly, trying to see if this escalates to the point where they need to intercede...again. Because this is not the first time something like this has happened to me at this place. That's right, this is the second time in the last six months or so that I've gotten into an argument with a man who wouldn't leave me alone when I told him to. Apparently, he's had his fill, because he scrambles out of the booth, grabs his backpack, and starts retreating to the exit across the building. Again, he turns to walk away, stops, turns back to me, turns to walk away, turns back, rinse, repeat. As he does this little dance, he peppers in accusations of my being mentally ill, my needing to see a psychiatrist, oh, and also racist invective and the classic demand that I go back to where I came from. And the day started out so nicely. Thanks, random stranger."
