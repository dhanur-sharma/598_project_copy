        "Summarize the following story in first person: Going to visit my dad's new family was hard at first. I've wrote about the divorce and how messy it was. That's why it took so long to visit him. When he cheated on my mom, I never thought that I could forgive him. Years later, I decided that I am old enough and I can handle this. I reached out to him to see if I can come visit. He was surprised but sounded really happy about it. I took my family to his place and we sat in silence for a little while. His new wife was the woman he cheated on my mom with and was the reason that they got a divorce. She took my kids outside and they played. I told my dad that I was there to figure out why he did it. I needed answers so I could forgive and move on from this. He explained everything. After sitting and crying for a while with him about how much of the past few years we have missed from each other, we hugged and patched things up. My kids came running in and talking about catching frogs with my dad's wife and how much fun it was. My wife took to my dad's wife as well. What I thought would have been a horrible experience, ended up being one of the best ones. It's great to understand why my dad did things and it's also great to see him so happy now."
