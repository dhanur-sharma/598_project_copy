        "Summarize the following story in first person: In June I had my dog put to sleep. She was suffering and the decision was a necessary one. She had been a wonderful companion and letting her go was difficult. At the vet she roused a bit and struggled to follow me. It was as if she knew what was coming. Afterward, there was more adjustment to my life than I had counted on. When I got home from the vet I had to round up and dispose of her things. This was a sad exercise. Each item recalled a specific moment and the reason for buying it. I had no trouble donating my parents excess possessions to charity when they passed. I found it unexpectedly difficult to do the same for my dog's things. They were my possessions really, but in my mind I attributed ownership to her. I had to cancel the automatic delivery of her dog food. The customer service rep took that as an opportunity to try and sell me things, which I didn't appreciate. I don't like to think of pets as possessions, but after a short period of mourning I decided it would not be disloyal to adopt another dog. I took my time and in early August brought home a female Basset hound puppy. She seems happy and the pet void in my life has been substantially filled. We are having a familiar yet unique set of experiences."
