        "Summarize the following story in first person: A couple of months ago, I was visiting my sister, brother in law, and nephew. My mom and daughter were with me, too. One day, my sister had an appointment and my brother in law was at work. It was getting to be nap time for my nephew, and my mom was getting ready to start his nap time routine with him, and he said he wanted me to do it instead. I was out on the porch talking to my husband on the phone, and my mom was holding my nephew and walking down the stairs, and he saw me and made her go get me so that I could put him down for a nap. This made me feel so happy because sometimes I worry that we don't have a super strong bond. My sister has a very strong bond with my daughter, and I want the same with her son. However, I worry about that not happening because they live in a different state now, so he doesn't get to spend a lot of time with me. It made me feel like we do have a really strong bond when he insisted on me doing his routine with him. I got to cuddle him while he drank some milk. Then, we went into his bedroom and read a couple of books. We cuddled some more while rocking in his rocking chair. Then, I laid him in his crib and he went right to sleep, just like he does for his mom. It made me feel like I was a regular part of his life. It meant a lot to me."
