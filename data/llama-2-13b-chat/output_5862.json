        "Summarize the following story in first person: Hi Diary, As you know I have suffered with depression for four to five years and I've had anxiety attacks for much longer. Medication from the doctors that have not helped. They gave me pregablin, which is essentially speed, which helps with the depression and also the sciatica I suffer with, but I hate taking it. A few months back I was watching some documentary about LSD and how it could help depression. So I decided to speak to a friend who gets LSD. I'd never tried it before, but have taken many other substances over the years. I decided to try micro dosing for a month. I was taking an eighth of a tab every five days. My depression lifted almost entirely after the third dose. My productivity increased ten fold. I found sitting on the sofa horrible, something I'd done almost non stop for four years. My perspective changed, I was way happier and my wife, who has never taken any substances, noticed the difference immediately and my new mood made her much happier. The clarity of thought whilst dosed and the following days is something I'd never experienced. I was absolutely amazed at how well it worked. I haven't dosed for 10 days and I feel awful. Depression, anxiety, panic attacks, not sleeping and I'm back on the sofa. I have some of my last tab left, so I think I will start dosing again."

I just wish I could afford to go to a proper therapist or get some proper help. It's so expensive and I'm on a low income. It's not easy trying to find a way out of this depression and anxiety. I just wish there was a way to get proper help. I'm going to try and do some more research on LSD and see if there is any more information on it's use in treating depression. I just want to feel happy and normal again. I miss that feeling. I'll update you soon diary, take care."
