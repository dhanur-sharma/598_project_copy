I never wanted to completely shut out the idea because that means walling off a life that could become something I desire at any point. When me and my wife talked about having kids, this was of course with her knowing how I felt, it suddenly started to make sense. It could have been the hormones talking, but all of a sudden with her kids didn't sound so bad. We didn't try very hard, but one day the fateful notice was seen. She was pregnant. I was going to be a father. How did this happen? Well I know how it happened, but I didn't try too hard to stop it. Nine months later, my little girl was born. I honestly couldn't believe it when she was in my arms for the first time. All of a sudden, I realized that in some way I had wanted this secretly my whole life. I felt whole."
