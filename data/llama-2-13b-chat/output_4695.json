        "Summarize the following story in first person: I got an email from management telling me to meet with others in the auditorium. I was a bit worried at first, thinking I did something wrong.  However I saw others in top management position smiling as I entered the room. I was pleasantly surprised when they announced that I was been promoted. I was applauded and told that I was promoted as a manager. They told me that my performance is top performance. They said that cooperate was extremely pleased with how I do my work.  I would be in charge of 25 people in my group. I must say that I was trying to pinch myself to see if I was dreaming. I was then presented with gifts. I was also given a gift card valuing one thousand dollars. I was also given gift card to eat at Red Lobster. I am happy that I really worked hard and I am very grateful for this position. They told me that there is more room for growth. Eventually I could be an executive, if I continue on the same pace. Members from cooperate gave a lengthy speech about my performance."
