        "Summarize the following story in first person: My husband and I got married a couple years ago, and really wanted to have kids. We were trying for kids for the past year, and it was very heartbreaking and difficult. There was a lot of pressure to have kids After about a year we had all but given up and decided to adopt instead. A couple months ago, I found out I was pregnant and we were really really happy. We had just gotten really great insurance. We are so excited to be parents soon. This event is really special for us, since it took so long to get pregnant, and it is my parents' first grandchild and my grandmothers' first great-grandchild as well! It was also really special for our family too. My sister in law knew how difficult it had been, and she was so happy for us. She revealed to us that she was pregnant too, and only a little further along than me, so our kids will be close in age. We were really excited for each other. My grandparents were also really excited.  Right after I found out, we went on vacation to the lake. I will always remember that lake as a special place now. We are hoping to make more memories at this lake too!"
