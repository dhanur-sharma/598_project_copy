        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last year, My Fiance and I decided we wanted a baby. About five months ago she ran into the room and showed me her pregnancy test with excitement. This was a very emotional moment because we had been trying for five months. The whole process has been life-changing. I feel like I've grown so much as a person because of this. Her sister isn't able to have babies so we weren't sure if it was hereditary at first. So Immediately when we found out, we were both really happy. We had bounced names off of each other all week for a boy or a girl. I think at the time we decided either Luca or Atlas if it was a boy. If it was a girl we were both set on rory, since we used to binge gilmore girls. A few months later and we finally were at the doctor. This was going to be the big gender reveal. Our child was being stubborn in his mom and wouldn't turn over but eventually we discovered what we were going to have. We're having a boy. Words can describe how excited i am for him to arrive."
