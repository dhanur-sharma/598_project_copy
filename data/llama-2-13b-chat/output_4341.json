        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 3 months ago, my sister got married to her high school sweetheart. I was so excited because I really got along with her fianc\u00e9. He has helped me out a lot so I was excited for him to become a part of our family. The venue was amazing too, there's nothing better than a destination wedding in Hawaii. There were so many different decorations that were all so new to me because I had never been to Hawaii. All the different colorful flowers, the gorgeous hula girls and their colorful outfits, everything was perfect. The only sad part is that a lot of family and friends could not make it because it was so far and expensive to travel there. But, when we least expected it, our friends from back home showed up which was a huge surprise. It was actually surprising of them because they usually do not like to spend money on traveling for less than a week but they made it out. I think they purposely told us they could not make it so they can surprise us. My friends, my sister's friends, and her finance's friends were all there. I was so happy that their best friends showed up for them. But, not to be selfish, I was also happy that I would be able to spend the last day after the wedding in Hawaii with all of my friends. After the beautiful wedding, we all celebrated almost all night. Our friends and family were there to celebrate my sister and her fianc\u00e9. I got to spend time with my best friends, specifically my girlfriend. I was so happy they decided to surprise us and come in the end. Now, everyone is asking me when my wedding is..typical."
