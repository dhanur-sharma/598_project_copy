        "Summarize the following story in first person: Today me and my friends went on a trip. We decided to go camping, the group we went with was very large. The next day when we woke up we had a nice breakfast cooked over the camp fire. It reminded me of my days in the boy scouts when I was young. After we cleaned up the mess we made by making breakfast we decided to head to the river. We also brought a kayak and paddle boards to enjoy our time on the river. I have never kayaked before, nor even seen a paddle board. I tried both and they were equally enjoyable. When I first got into the kayak it flipped over on me, we all laughed. Once I was able to turn the kayak back over and get back in we explored down the river. As we kayaked on the river there were many beautiful nature scenes we observed, it was very peaceful. Once we returned to the dock I tried to paddle board, it was really not as much fun as kayaking so I did not participate long. After several hours on the river we were all tired, and decided to pull the river toys out of the water and take a break. As we were eating a snack I could not help but think how assured I was of the growth me and my friends have made in the last couple years. It is great to have wonderful friends that truly care for one another. I had such a great time camping and being on the river, I can't wait till I cam come back."
