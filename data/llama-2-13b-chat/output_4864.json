        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 5 months ago I attended the graduation ceremony for my oldest Son. I remember watching him get ready. Fussing over his clothes and hair but trying to hide that from us. He looked so handsome in his bright green gown. I remember his, then, girlfriend was going to be there and he was a little shy about us meeting her. He was anxious to leave that day but also acting like it was no big deal to rush. In the car ride over he sat in the back seat with his siblings. They sang songs from camp. The younger two were in awe and a bit of envy over their big brother. We all felt so proud. Pulling up to the school I took a minute to take it all in. A sea of young teenagers in green gowns, feeling accomplished, all funneled into one place. The setting was meant to be formal but it was comically ironic how \"cheap\" a lot of it seemed. Once all of the students came in it was impossible to tell any of them apart. I sat through the few hundred names letting my attention wander off to his first day of school. A handful of bad days that involved tears over the years. But I also thought about how proud and excited I was for him. And entire lifetime of opportunity and experiences lay before him. I was interested in the difference between my current state of being settled in my life and his just starting to be lived for himself."
