        "Summarize the following story in first person: I've traveled a decent amount of time and places before but I haven't really done much with my wife. we are normally working a lot and my work calls for travel so it's easier for me. On her end she doesn't really have the time to due to work. about 5 months ago we made the change to travel more. we had discussed places we'd like to go and vegas was one. So we chose to visit las vegas first. This would be first time traveling with the wife to las vegas. we had to catch a plane to vegas because driving would have cost about the same. So we decided that it would just be easier to fly. once we had got there we checked into our rooms gotten a litte confortable and then went to dinner. The same night we had to see the attractions and lights as well as the desert landscape. It was pretty dry in the air due to the desert. That type of landscape is unfamiliar to us as we are from a tropical island. So we had to adjust to the different climates. It was a good experience something new that we hadn't done before."
