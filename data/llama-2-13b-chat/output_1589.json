        "Summarize the following story in first person: Since I first received the news that I needed to quit my job, which I loved, I have made many changes in my life.  First, I quit my job the day before Thanksgiving break. I cried when I talked with my friend in HR. I FINALLY purchased my rollator. This was a huge act of acceptance, as I had fought doing this. The rollator sat in my truck for 2 weeks, never used. I refused to bring it into my home. I felt I didn't need it inside. I simply did NOT want to use it. One day I fell twice inside my home. That same day I was so out of balance, bouncing around,  hitting walls, etc. So, I asked my husband to go get it.  Eagerly, I began to use it that day. I was okay with it as I definitely needed this aid at the time. A few days later when I wasn't as out of balance I stopped using it. Then my balance went crazy again. I bounced around, not using the rollator. My husband put it in front of me. Now, I can happily say I am using my rollator in my home whenever I need it. I view this aid as my friend now. Once I order a basket for the front, it will be even more useful to me. I have been stubborn about using this, but now I am at peace with it. I've accepted what I need to do."
