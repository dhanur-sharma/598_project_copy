        "Summarize the following story in first person: Breaking up with Stacy was one of the hardest things I'd ever done. We were together for 5 years. We had been through so much together. At one point I was positive she would have been my wife. But over time that all changed. I started to realize I didn't really feel the same way about her as I did at the beginning. Eventually I couldn't even fake the love. All we did was fight and yell at each other. I started saying nasty things to her and she would cry all the time. Then I met someone else and I was attracted to them, that's when I knew it was over. I knew I had to do the right thing and tell Stacy I no longer loved her. I knew it would break her heart. She really believed we would be together forever. She even had our future kids names picked out. She was totally committed to me. I did it the easy way, I called her up on the phone. After 5 years together I didn't even have the guts to tell her in person that I was leaving her. She was livid, which I understood. She told me I was basically the biggest piece of trash she had ever met. It was a terrible experience. I never wanted to hurt her, but I just didn't love her any more."
