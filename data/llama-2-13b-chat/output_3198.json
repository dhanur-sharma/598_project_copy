        "Summarize the following story in first person: The story must correspond to the summary and I believe this one does. I'm going to tell you a story about what happened to me because of being a kind person. A years ago when I was going down the highway there was someone who's belongings flew off of his truck. It included things like a dresser and a mattress. Things were all over the highway and I knew he would need help to get it picked up before they got damaged or caused an accident. I decided to pull over to the side of the highway and assist him with picking his items up. We got things picked up from the highway and back into his truck. I used some extra tie down straps I had in my truck to help secure his items. After all of that was done we got to some talking and I find out that he is actually the CEO of a tech startup. He offers me a job on the spot saying that he would love to have such a kind person working with him. After a series of bad investments and bad luck, he eventually had to shut down the company. What I learned while working there was invaluable. I learned how to do things on my own and I now successfully work from home. This was a huge deal for me because I have depression that makes it hard to get out and be social around people. Working from home is perfect for me. I will forever be grateful to that man. I will never forget that day that changed my life forever, all because of a simple act of kindness."
