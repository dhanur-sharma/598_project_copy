        "Summarize the following story in first person: It's been nine weeks since my youngest daughter was married, and I'm thrilled I was able to attend. After receiving my cancer diagnosis it did not appear likely that I would be able to live to the wedding in June. The thought of such a thing just broke my heart. It also filled me with regret. My older daughter suggested an interesting idea, and figured we could do a mock wedding in order to give me the chance to witness a ceremony. Though it was hard emotionally for all of us, it truly made sense to do it advance just in case my treatments were unsuccessful. I had a great time and everything was perfect, but ultimately it saddened me more and left me feeling unfulfilled. Then, with less than a month remaining until her wedding, I went in for my final experimental treatment. By the grace of God something happened that day and my cancer started to go in remission. The doctor gave me a much longer prognosis to live, and told me that I better get my butt to that wedding! We cried and cried with joy over the results of my tests. When I called my daughter to tell her the good news she screamed with delight. We even went out to celebrate at our favorite restaurant later that night. So after a mock ceremony, I was truly able to attend the real thing! I couldn't be happier that I have now attended all of my children's weddings! What joy!"
