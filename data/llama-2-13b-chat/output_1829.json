        "Summarize the following story in first person: My life started not feeling like my own, like I would have to ask permission to do things and if I did them anyway I would get in trouble. This of course did not just happen today, it was over a span of days. The father to my recently born child makes me feel like I can't do anything without first telling him, even though we are not dating. The days would start normal, I would send him a morning picture of the outfit the child was wearing that day and keep him updated with how he slept through the night. On the normal days that would be the end of the conversation, he'd ask a few more questions if he needed more information about how the child is doing and I would answer. Some days he would bring up the conversation of why we can't just be together, and that he doesn't understand why I would just give up. I would explain to him over and over again that we are just two different people that don't work and its in the child's best interest that we aren't together. This of course, always made him angry and I would have to remind him that our conversations need to just be about the child. He would still make comments to me, 'you look nice today, who are you getting all done up for?', 'I don't want to date anyone else', and 'who is all going, who are you with, why do you even hang out with him?'. I started feeling like I just didn't want to do anything because I didn't want to have to deal with his anger or his constant phone calls to me when I wouldn't answer him. I started not being around when he visits the baby, so he can focus on the baby and not me. He hated that, and hated even more that I wouldn't tell him who I was with, and started calling me back to back nonstop. He would say that he was only calling because he had a question about how to do the baby's bath but a call back to him told me that was a lie. His visits became fewer and then nonexistent, the only time he sees the child now is when I bring the baby to his work for a visit. I have since taken my life back into my hands, I only bring the baby by if I'm not busy when he asks me to bring the baby. I say no when he asks if he can buy me dinner for my birthday or anything else. I am struggling financially, but his anger and his obsession with me scares me to the point that I fear getting legal help or child support."
