I went ahead and tried to pass the CDL, but didn't. I guess I wasn't ready. I went home and did some practice. I read up on tips online. I also did some test runs with a buddy. I went back and took the test again. I had two days between both trials. This time I got it right. I was able to get my CDL. It took two tries, but it was successful. I am happy I was able to achieve this. I would advise anyone to give it a shot. It can be daunting, but manageable. I am happy to have a CDL now."
