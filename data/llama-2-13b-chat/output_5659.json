        "Summarize the following story in first person: In approximately February 2019, I flew to Los Angeles to stay with my girlfriend with whom I was involved in a long distance relationship between Detroit and Los Angeles. Several years earlier, she and I had been in a long-term on-again/off-again relationship that had lasted more than a decade.  I moved to Detroit in about 2014, and we lost touch for about four years. However, we reconnected and reconciled in 2018. After reconnecting, we had several conversations in which we discussed how to structure our reconciliation and what our expectations of one another would be. We specifically told one another that we were going to be exclusively dating each other and that we would be trying to take the relationship toward marriage. Anyway, I was staying with her in Los Angeles around Valentine's Day 2019. While we were hanging out one day, I made an off-hand comment about how I had told someone else that my girlfriend and I were in an exclusive committed relationship. Her reaction to my comment was astounding to me. She looked like at me like I had just crapped on the floor when I made that comment. The look one her face was one of pure guilt. She tentatively asked me, \"Did we say that?\" The she backtracked and tried to recover and cover her tracks, but it soon became abundantly clear that she had been seeing other guys and lying to me about her whereabouts. As I questioned her, she denied everything, but her denials became weaker and weaker each time I asked her about it. As I look back on 2018 and 2019, I see so many things that make much more sense if I simply assume that she was just a prolific liar and a cheater. During our relationship, she had always told me about different guys she would hang out with and party with, but she had always assured me that \"they were just friends.\" Now I see that I was a sucker and swallowed one of the oldest lies out there. Anyway, I flew back to Detroit and broke up with her shortly thereafter. It was the best thing for both of us, and I'm feeling much happier now that her negative influence is completely out of my life. I have definitely moved on and am back to enjoying life."
