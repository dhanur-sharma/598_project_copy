        "Summarize the following story in first person: i dont understand why people think they need to hide or lie about things. i have a friend i am currently living with due to medical reasons. hes a good guy but tends to be VERY rash and doesnt always think things through before doing them. his parents got him this nice old quaint house for a steal and so he lives here with myself and another set of friends. the bad part here is, they dont get along with anyone anymore. they tend to be very standoffish and self serving along with being very self centered. its not a fun thing since they really bring the house down. which is where this comes in. he has been frustrated with them for months, even before i came along. i knew this but not to the extent that i just found out. i find out that they have owed his parents rent for months and have barely paid anything on what they owe . in addition to this, now the friend whats out of this arrangement all around. hes tired of trying to get things working and to find another job since he will have to change jobs in the next few months. which is fine,i told him thats not an issue and we can find him something else. but nope, he doesnt want to do that, he just wants to give up and move out of state. out of state to where he knows one person, after complaining about him being alone here with only knowing us. people really make no damned sense and just are really starting to annoy me."
