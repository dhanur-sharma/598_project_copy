        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was on a vacation with my brother, and we decided to take a long road trip through New England and up to the Canadian border.  We set off with only a rough destination in mind, and intending to go or do whatever caught our eye over the long drive of about a week.  We stopped in many cool little towns along the way.  There were really great old antique shops all over and I loved looking through the old memorabilia.  Along the route, we were passing through Vermont, and off the side of the road we saw a beautiful grassy mountain with a waterfall cascading down the side.  We thought it looked so cool, we parked and decided to hike up the mountain side a bit.  It was an easy climb, but long and tiring.  We stayed as close to the waterfall as we could as we went up.  We ended up climbing all the way to the top, and got an amazing view.  On the way back down we took a different route, and not far from the top, found a glistening pool where the waterfall cascaded, and then continued out the other side.  It was perfect for taking a refreshing dip, and we did!  It was ice cold, but really awesome.  The rest of the trip was great.  We went into little towns and ate amazing seafood.  I never ate so much lobster and so many bowls of chowder in my life!  It was really amazing, and there were many memorable spots.  We even crossed the border into Canada and drove a ways up the coast, which was really rugged and beautiful.  We visited a national park in Canada and spent one night there.   We saw many beautiful spots, but that one dip on the mountainside in the ice cold spring water was the coolest part, and a great memory."
