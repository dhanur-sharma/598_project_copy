        "Summarize the following story in first person: My daughter was accepted in Rutgers University. I was pretty proud because I home-schooled her. She had a lot of problems focusing starting in the third grade so I pulled her out of school. That was a scary decision for both of us but especially me. I was pressured by friends and family and quite frankly shamed.  We were told she would never get into college if I did that. It took many months to find what schedule worked and how to help her learn best.  It was a lot of work but together we preserved. Sometimes I see traces of the old problems but she has plenty of coping mechanisms and self-esteem to deal with any problems that arise. So, needless to say when she was accepted that was a huge moment for us. We were in a state of happy shock.  I will never forget that day. We were both at home when we got the call. I thought something had gone wrong but it was her recruiter calling. He told her where to look to check her status and there is was! We were overjoyed!"
