        "Summarize the following story in first person: I recently went on one of my favorite hikes in a nearby mountain range. It was a beautiful day. This particular trail was rather difficult. Although I had hiked it many times, I felt more physically exhausted than usual. I quickly realized I was going to have a tough day on the trail. There were several points along the hike where I thought about turning around. However, I kept moving forward. When I reached the summit of the mountain I felt a great sense of personal pride and accomplishment. I love hiking and I consider it a big part of who I am as a person. I spent at least two years of my life hiking several times a month. I would mostly go hiking alone. I like hiking alone because I learn something new about myself each time. The time I spend alone with myself in the mountains is very valuable. On this particular hike I realized that the trail does not always just hand you a victory. This is a valuable lesson that I hope to carry with me through other areas of my life."
