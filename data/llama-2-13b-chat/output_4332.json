        "Summarize the following story in first person: My mother and I recently closed out the estate.  My father passed over a year ago and we have been working diligently since that time.  There has been an endless stream of paperwork and a lot of contact with lawyers.  My mom was unable to handle most of it so I was put in charge of the stressful aspects.  Frankly, it has been an ongoing nightmare.  So, I was somewhat relieved yet still stressed when I had to deal with debt collectors a few months ago.  I don't like dealing with them and there was a lot of pressure on me.  Thankfully, I was able to strike fair deals with them.  After that, our lawyers had to handle the final paperwork.  We were grateful in that there was a few thousand left over.  We had thought that the estate was completely insolvent.  All in all, it was the most difficult experience of my life.  When our lawyers finally did the final accounting and worked the court, they called us to let us know it was done.  We had a nice conference call and got together to celebrate.  I still can't believe it's over!"
