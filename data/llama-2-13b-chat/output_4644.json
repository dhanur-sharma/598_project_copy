We quickly prepared for the hospital. My brother was already shaking. We got into be car  and drove straight to the hospital. Immediately we got there, the nurses attended to us. She was taken to the labor room and after some minutes, the doctor came out to congratulate my brother. It was a boy. I was so excited. A day before her delivery, we had a conversation about who the child would look like. He was a replica of his father."
