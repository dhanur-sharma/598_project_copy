        "Summarize the following story in first person: My son describes himself as a crazy cat lady, and he loves cats with all his heart.  He pretends to be a cat, he plays with his cats, he runs around meowing and grooming himself, basically anything a child can do to emulate a cat, he does.  For the last year he has had two cats and always talked about wanting more, always asking if we could get another, pointing out how he would be able to care for another anytime the opportunity arose.  I, as his mom, had said no to any more cats numerous times.  I was dead set against getting anymore, two was enough to feed and care for and buy litter for them to use.  Near my son's seventh birthday his father, my exhusband, called me up and asked if I was interested in a free cat.  My immediate response was no, I was not interested in having another cat in the house.  Then my ex said the cat was going to be a ragdoll, and my immediate no became an enthusiastic yes.  I had previously been interested in getting a rag doll kitty, I knew they were prized for the soft coats and gentle temperaments, and I knew they were sold for thousands of dollars.  Hearing that I could get one for free was amazing and I was not going to miss out on the chance to own a ragdoll.  She came home to us the weekend before his birthday and the humans here loved her immediately.  The other two cats took a little while to warm up to her, but they did.  Now it's commonplace to find them snuggled up to each other sleeping, or darting around playing together like furry little streaks of thunderous kitty running rampage. The cost of caring for three cats is somehow exponentially more than only two, but I wouldn't trade my new kitty for any amount of money in the world.  In this short time she has became a family member and you cannot put a price on your family members."
