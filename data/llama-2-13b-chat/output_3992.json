        "Summarize the following story in first person: I had been feeling a little down because I was going through some difficult times and needed cheering up. I went to see my boyfriend, who I have a long distance relationship with, for the weekend. My birthday was coming up and I felt down because I did not want to feel alone. He told me he was taking me out to the pub and nothing seemed unusual. When we got there I was surprised and delighted to find that a surprise party with all of our friends had been arranged. Everyone was there, including my best friend. This made me feel really emotional and grateful. I was so happy to see all of my friends and to know that they cared. For the entire evening people bought me drinks and made me feel loved and supported. We talked and socialized for hours. At the end of the evening my boyfriend and I strolled home holding hands and I felt full of love for him. We talked about the evening and I told him how much I appreciated what he did. It was a really happy event for me!  The best part of it all was the fact that people went out of their way just for me. They took time out of their own schedules to arrange an event purely to support me."
