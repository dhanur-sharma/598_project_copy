        "Summarize the following story in first person: My brother lives across the country, where we all grew up. My other brother and I live in a new city now, so he came to visit us. I was excited to see him since it had been about two years. I don't go to visit him because he still lives with my parents and I don't have a relationship with them anymore. My visiting brother is very into good deals and things that are well priced, so we found a lot of low cost activities to do. We also did a lot of traveling in the area, since my brother isn't very familiar with it. We went to the coast and spent some time on the beach. We went to visit a mountain and took lots of pictures. We went to an area with lots of waterfalls and did a bit of hiking. We had a fun time joking around and taking pictures of each other. My brother who lives in town has a girlfriend whose father was visiting at the same time, so we all spent time together and got to know each other. We went to a big city and did tourist type activities. Of course, we ate a lot of food. We went to local restaurants and also cooked some food. I'm really glad we got to have this experience and that my brother and I are still close."
