        "Summarize the following story in first person: In late March, I flew to Chicago with my boyfriend for a wedding. One of his close friends from college was getting married to her boyfriend of 10 years, and I was invited as my boyfriend's +1. This was more than a wedding for me though, as this would be the last weekend we would spend together before he deploys. My boyfriend is in a branch of the military here in the United States. Due to recent political events, his deployment had been up in the air. One day his deployment was cancelled (yay!), whereas other days he was set to leave the following week. He had finally received word in mid-March that he would be leaving at the beginning of April, just a couple of days after his friend's wedding. The weekend of the wedding, we flew into Chicago and lazily made our way to our hotel. I had never been to Chicago before and I was really excited to see the sights and enjoy the food. After checking in, we met up with his group of friends at a rooftop bar. After devouring the spiciest wings known to man, we all took shots and then made our way downtown. The night was honestly a blur, but I can clearly remember how I was feeling. I had never felt more in love...or as sad. After we returned from a wonderful weekend where we spent time with my boyfriend's friends and danced our hearts out at the wedding, the reality of this deployment hit me head-on. And just a few short days after our return from Chicago, I said good-bye to my boyfriend at the airport."
