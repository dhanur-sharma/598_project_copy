        "Summarize the following story in first person: Sixteen hours in the car is enough to make anyone crazy. When that sixteen-hour road trip includes torrential thunderstorms nearly the entire time it's even worse. To say the drive from Chicago to Connecticut was stressful is putting it mildly. When we pulled up to the beautiful, historical boarding school where my daughter would be living for the next few months we all knew it was worth it. The school was originally built in the late 1700s and the original buildings are just as beautiful and imposing as they were hundreds of years ago. Any residual trepidation I had about leaving my young daughter here slowly flew away with the light breeze in the enormous oaks in the quad. We got our room assignment and found my daughter's room. As we made our way up the three flights of stairs to unpack her, we realized immediately how tough a New England summer without air conditioning was going to be. She was so excited, she didn't even notice. We made our way into her new room and met her roommate and their family and thankfully it was a great match. After we got everything unpacked and set up, it was time to say goodbye. I've never left my kids before, especially so far away and for an extended period of time. I had been preparing for this moment for months. I told myself I had to be strong for her. As I leaned in to kiss her goodbye, and saw her admiring her new pointe shoes from the corner of her eye, I knew everything was going to be just fine. With a big wave and grin she yelled \"bye mommy!\" as I walked out the door, and I didn't shed a single tear."
