        "Summarize the following story in first person: I remember the day we had our counselling after the results were out. I had worked immensely hard for the last one year and was really hoping to get a seat in GMCH. When my seat got confirmed there, I was elated. But more than me, my parents were happy. It was nice to see their proud faces. But that's a story for another day. Today is about the person who was the happiest that day - My GRANDFATHER. On the day of counselling, he accompanied me the office of the Director of Medical Education. On seeing my name in the list of the selected candidates for GMC, he was elated beyond measures. It could be seen in his face; it was being reflected in his eyes and his voice. We went home after the counselling was over. As the entire family sat for lunch, he suddenly called me to his room. I went inside grandpa gave me a box, somewhat twice the size of a typical geometry box, and it looked very old. I opened the box - it contained the equipments I'd be needing for MBBS in the 1st year. I smiled as he gave the box to me. He then said the following words which I'll never be able to forget. He said - \u201cAnnu, I had brought this set almost 20 years back. As I was passing by one of the medical supplies shop during my trips (he's a surveyor), my eyes fell upon this box. It was expensive at that time, and more than that- unnecessary, yet, I still bought it, hoping that someday I can give it to my children or grandchildren. You've fulfilled my dream today. Maybe, God wanted me to witness this. Maybe, He has kept me alive for this day only.\u201d That day, I'll make you proud in the truest sense."
