Now, I need to make sure I get my final pay before leaving. I'm not sure if I will get the bonus or not, but I am hopeful. There is still a lot needed to done at home. I still need to meet with the landlord to go over any possible damages. I also need to clean and sell some of my remaining items. I still haven't even started packing. That is the scariest part! I am relocating to halfway around the world and am not ready to move with all my stuff like this. However, work-wise I am really ready to go. I haven't felt this happy in months. I really didn't like this job and felt like I was pushing through most days or not. It is scary not knowing what my future will be since I don't have a job lined up. However, I know I will be able to do this. It is a scary leap but it is better than staying here forever."
