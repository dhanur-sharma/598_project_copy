        "Summarize the following story in first person: Our youngest son and his wife live about 2 hours away from us.  He called and said that his wife had to be in town and that they thought they might stop by on that day for a visit. We were so excited. They arrived, we all hugged and they handed us a red heart shaped box and said it was just a little something for us.  We opened the box and, inside, found a little onesie, a baby t-shirt.  We were shocked, I was crying and laughing.  They are going to have a baby.  We are going to be Grandparents!  This was very unexpected and we were so surprised.  Then we were told that we had to keep it a secret until about the three month mark. This was going to be difficult.  This was a wonderful experience.  They will have a baby boy in February.  This makes retirement really exciting.  We are so happy for them."
