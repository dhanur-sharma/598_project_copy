        "Summarize the following story in first person: 3 months ago I had the task of preparing for going out to dinner with my group of friends. I was in charge because I love planning stuff. I narrowed it down to a few places. My one friend is vegan ,so I had to find somewhere with options for her. Another friend is lactose intolerant, so that meant in Italian food. After taking everyones diet into account I found the perfect restaurant. It was a modern place with lots of dairy free and meat free options. WHen I asked everyone they agreed that was a good place. The night we were supposed to meet I had trouble finding something to wear. I thought I had the perfect dress. When I went to put it on I found out it didn't fit any longer. I started to panic. I didn't have a backup outfit. I eventually settled on dressy jeans and a top, but I felt under dressed. Despite the chaos the dinner was fun. Everyone had a great time. It was nice to be able to catch up with my friends outside of our homes."
