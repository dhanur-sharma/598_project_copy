        "Summarize the following story in first person: My father died about 6 months ago. His passing was tragic, but in all the time that has passed I don't feel as though I've really come to terms with losing him. So I had been thinking of a way that I could finish the grieving process and come to terms with everything. Then, I thought about something that he always talked about. He used to say that when he finally retired he would put away his work suit and put on his gardening rags. I always rolled my eyes, thinking if he really wanted to garden he'd make time for it in the present. But every time our family tour the nearby Botanical Gardens  I would see the longing on his face. The contentment he seemed to have when he'd bring home a plant he picked out, brought home and nurtured, then gave to a friend. Even though he's gone now, I want to feel closer to him. I want to fulfill his dream of gardening for happiness and pleasure. So from now on, until I can no longer, I will be spend every weekend tending to my father's dream garden. I'll find all his favorite plants. I'll even pull out all of his old landscape designs. I'll figure out a way to incorporate his ideas into my own land. I think this is the best way to honor his memory."
