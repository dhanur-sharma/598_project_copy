        "Summarize the following story in first person: I travel a good portion of the year and my travels last summer landed me in the Florida Keys. I was traveling in Florida when I was offered a job working on an island. I was surprised when I got the job because I was planning on staying at spot for vacation the same week I was scheduled to start the job. It all just fell into place like it was meant to be. I immediately accepted the job and headed for the Keys. I arrived in paradise and was amazed at the scenery. I spent a couple of days getting situated and then went to work. It was a mostly outside job and I enjoyed being in the environment and seeing all of the wildlife. I worked directly with guests vacationing in the keys and met many nice people. The lifestyle was so different anything I had ever experienced and was very enjoyable. I made many new friends and have stayed in contact with them. My wife and I would interact with co-workers during and outside of work. We were really able to experience the Keys to the fullest. We interacted with the community, enjoyed the food, experienced the night life and spent a fair amount of time on the water, fishing, boating, and scuba diving. I will never forget this experience and hope someday to return."
