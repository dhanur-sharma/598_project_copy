        "Summarize the following story in first person: I have never taken on a remodeling project in our home.  I was excited and nervous because it seemed like we were spending a lot of money to buy materials and hire a contractor.  There are many parts of our home that need work but we decided on the master bathroom.  I had picked out a contractor who had done a small job for me 2 years ago but I really didn't know him well.  He didn't give me much guidance about what I needed to do to prepare for the project so all I did was pick out some tile for the wall.  I think he assumed that I knew more than I know (I tend to fool people like this sometimes :) ) so I felt kind of stupid when he was asking me questions.  It turned out that he had similar taste in terms of design and he was able to give me some great advice.  He and his helper were easy to be around and I feel like I made a new friend.  The bathroom is beautiful but this isn't where the story ends.  Meeting him kind of flipped my  world on its axis.  I found myself energized to not only see the house differently but to look at myself differently.  It's like I woke up from a funk and have started paying attention to myself and my surroundings.  I painted the front of the house and replaced the house numbers.  I bought some plants to add some color.  I renewed my  gym membership and started going regularly.  I polish my nails now!  Maybe I was depressed, I don't know.  I'm not manic now, I still love to watch TV and go online but I feel like I can do anything I set my mind to."
