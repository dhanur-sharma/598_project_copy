        "Summarize the following story in first person: Two years ago my mom passed away. It was the worst day of my life, and a day I will never forget. It was very unexpected and traumatic. It was a Sunday morning, and I got the call from my dad who told me she had passed. I just remember screaming, and not really being able to do much else. I told my husband and we both just cried and cried. I couldn't believe what was happening and was to young to lose my mom. I remember collapsing while trying to pack to fly to where she and my dad lived. I had a young daughter at the time and my heart was breaking for her that she would never get to know my mom. And that my mom wouldn't be able to get to know her. I mourned at the lost time and the major events my mom would not be apart of. It was heartbreaking. The rest of the day was a big blur, as I just went through the motions and didn't even really remember much. When we got to my parents house, we were surrounded by family and friends, but I felt so lonely. I remember just going into her room, and crying thinking how could this be happening. It was the worst day, and even 2 years later, it still is hard to breathe when I think about it.  She died from pneumonia. Something that happens all the time to people, but it took my mom. Emotionally it has been so daunting. Losing someone you love that much is so hard, and is not something you ever get over. The days get easier to get through, but that moment is always in the back of your mind, and the person lost is always thought of."
