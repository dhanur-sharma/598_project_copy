        "Summarize the following story in first person: One morning three months ago I was in a hurry and tripped on the steps while running to take a shower before work. I ended up fracturing 4 metatarsal bones that required two surgeries to fix. I was really having a hard time not being able to walk whenever I wanted to. I really had such a bad attitude at the beginning because I was so used to being independent. Now that I have recovered I have a new appreciation for my ability to walk. I feel like the whole time I couldn't walk I was thinking about how much I took that ability for granted. But now I choose to walk more than I ever had before. When I walk the dogs I go further out of my way just to enjoy the ability to do it. I am completely recovered and I am going to take this as a lesson learned. Nothing is more important that my personal health. I need to make sure that even if I am running late, I need to take my time and be careful. Instead f making it to work on time, I ended up missing weeks of work. Now all I do at work is try and catch up with everything I missed. It was really nice that people at work came and visited me at the hospital. I really appreciated all the flowers and candy and food that was delivered. I think that this showed me how loved I truly am."
