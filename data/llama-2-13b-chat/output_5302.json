        "Summarize the following story in first person: A very close friend of mine and her 4 month old son had been living with me for a few weeks  I love/d her very much, for a very long time and had attempted to date for many times over the years  The reason they had moved in with me, was because of her husband's  inability to control his habits.  He had locked her and her son out of there home with only the clothes they had on at the time.  He refused to allow her in the house to grab anything for any reason, including formula . While she was living with me.  I allowed her to do whatever, whenever she wanted to do it.  I hadn't seen her for a few months prior to this  My friend was so happy to be a mother again.  You could see it on her face and she spent so much time with her son day and night.  It was very heart-warming.  He is a very good baby and she didn't hesitate to retrieve him upon him waking up from a nap.   I worried/warned her of the spoiling and that it may result in habits harder to break for both of them in the future     Slowly she had allowed the responsibilities to be shared with me involving feeding and caring for her son.  Assistance she claimed she never had with her her husband before.   I was happy to help and offer her assistance, not only because I still wished to date her, but because none of my children live with me any longer and it was a great reminisce time for myself.   As I had stated earlier, I allowed her to come and go as she pleased and I never told her what to do or set any rules what-so-ever for her.  This resulted in her having freedom she had not had for awhile.  Self-control is not in the top 10 best traits that she possesses and she over indulged herself to say the least.  She started to seek 'the party life' versus 'the stay at home mom life' that she had been for x amount of time.   Her son, although easy for me to handle and never was a direct issue, had started to miss his mom as much as he had her prior.   She was very capable and she never neglected her son in anyway.  However, I had said to her soon as I started to notice the change in degree of quality care she was giving him, compared to when she first got here.      She had stopped holding him while he drank from a bottle and started propping it up everytime.  I ad originally commented on how amazed I was about him not addicted to a pacifier and she expressed her worry of dental problems if she got him one.  Suddenly she had boughten him and got frustrated with him because wasn't seeming to want the pacifier she gave him.  So I had pointed out to her these changes I noticed that had been undesirable.  She argued with me, denied the possibility, accused my reasons for ulterior motivations and started to very obviously disrespect me at any given time.   So, after a few days of this I had no choice but to ask her to leave.   The moment after I asked her to she left and returned that evening with her husband to retrieve her belongings."
