        "Summarize the following story in first person: A few months ago I got married to this beautiful woman we met in college. I must it was hard getting to know her since she was an indoors kind of person. On that day I saw her as beautiful as the first day I saw her. The church was packed with the most closest friend in my life and my family members. The joy in my heart was so thrilling I was blushing a lot. The night before me and my male friends had a bachelors party that was so interestingly we over drunk. So on that day my hungover was so intense I felt like sleeping.  That day she walked to the front of the church with such a glowing smile I was proud I had her. As I took her head scuff of she smelled the stench of alcohol in my mouth she made a joke about it we giggled a bit before making our vows. The after party was the best and the memory will linger in my mind for the rest of my life. I will cherish that day, for the rest of my life. Since she reminds me how good that day was everyday. It makes me proud. She makes me proud. My dad made me proud for helping make the day a joy. My sisters and  my mother were the best. I love that day."
