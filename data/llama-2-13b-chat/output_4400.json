        "Summarize the following story in first person: I went to the Philippines in may of 2018. Right around now is a good time to go because it is before 'monsoon' season, and you might avoid the heavy rains. But don't quote me on that(I could have it switched around). Anyway, I went to Boracay, Coron(bausuanga), legaspi, Manila and the Bato rice terraces. Boracay and Manila are touristy, but boracay has great scuba diving if you're into that. If you like off the beaten path, in this order from my experience, Bato rice terraces, then legaspi, then Coron. Bato because it is so unique and out of the way (overnight is trip away), and you can do day and camping hikes. Legaspi because it is also not on the typical tourist agenda, but still really cool sights to see. Also great spicy foods. Coron is a small island, so technically off the beaten path, but is surrounded by ww2 Japanese ship wrecks that divers love to frequent. I spent a month there with a Filipino friend and we had a freakin blast. Also got to meet all of his family in his relatively small village, and do local things. Have many stories of you're interested for another time. Over all I haven't been else where in SE Asia, but I loved the Philippines and will not hesitate to return. I would love to go back, but money is an issue right now."
