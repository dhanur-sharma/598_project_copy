        "Summarize the following story in first person: Several months ago, I lived in what could only be described as a haunted house. It was located in Southern Colorado. My husband and I were needing a home and looking for a rental property, and this was a charming old house that was built in the late 1800's. Our landlord disclosed to my husband (not to me), that a previous tenant had committed suicide shortly before we were to move in. Knowing that we were already locked in and ready to move, my husband decided not to tell me about the situation for fear I would back out of the deal. It wasn't until we moved in and were settled that he shared the secret with me. The room that the tenant had killed herself in was my new office, and I had always had trouble breathing in there. There is no way to describe it other than the air was constantly sucked out of the room, so that if you were in there for any length of time with the windows and door closed, you literally could not breathe and would feel very faint, as though you needed oxygen or were going to black out. The first month we lived there, we would leave the light over the sink in the kitchen on. It would cut out at several second intervals throughout the night, which I could always see from my position in the bedroom while trying to go to sleep. It would render the house completely dark, and was unnerving. We decided to move out after two months because of the...unrest...that was felt there. Everyone who came into the house could feel the heaviness and the difficulty breathing. IT turned out that the previous tenant had overdosed, purposely, on Klonopin and suffocated in her sleep. This lack of being able to breathe was the most terrifying and memorable event from living there. I still believe this house was haunted."
