        "Summarize the following story in first person: Over a year ago I dated a woman who I thought I would marry. However this turned out not to be the case as the more I got to know her and her way of life the more I cared for her less and the love turned to hate. On our second dat e she really opened up to me and talked about her past and how the last guy she was with hit her. I told her I would never do that and comforted her while she cried a little. As we dated my text when unanswered and she seemed t ocare for me less and less. I have come to find out later she was still talking to the guy that had hit her and was locked up. At this point I said fuck it. I still for the life of me can't figure out why  you would want to date or be with someone that hits you and beats you for no good reason. to me that is not a man or even a person much a low down scumbag To me she deserves to get the shit beaten out of her if she wants to stay with a loser thug. The one good thing that came of this was the advice she gave me on our last date that maybe I should date white women. I am mixed (black and white) but have always like balck women more. Atfer a few months I put myself back out there on a dating website and got a lot of attraction. One message I got was very heart felt . iwaited a while to reply to this women because she was kind of the oppoist of want I wanted. Fast forward to now and me and her have been together for 6 months and she is the kindest sweetist person I know she builds me up checks in on my and is one hell of a lover. I am glad I took a chance on her. I am also gald that to spit me hating my ex i followed the only good advice she ever gave out. I feel that my current gf is the one for me and my future wife."
