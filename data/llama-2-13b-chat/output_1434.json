Or that you could see the baseball field when you went downtown? It was a great day for just walking around and seeing the sights. And the people! I saw so many people just out walking for lunch. Tall and short. Thin and fat. I saw the most interesting billboard to. It was about gay acceptance. I have never seen anything like that! Right out in public. I am so proud of the direction our society has come. I packed my lunch and went to a playground to eat. They had computer games there for kids to play! Right outside! I couldn't believe how much there was to see and do. In some of those building people were working out, eating and singing to just name a few. It was all so interesting."
