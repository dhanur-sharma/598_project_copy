        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was born in a small city in San Jose, where I lived in a rich neighborhood surrounded by multi-storey buildings. My mother and father parted ways when I was just 4 years old, and I lived with my mom and two older brothers. I rarely saw my father, although he was still a part of my life and made me try different sports or went bicycling with me. I rarely dwell in the past and sometimes my distant memories even seem to be from another person\u2019s life. I have changed so much over the years that I often wonder what kind of magic lead me to this current place. I am so used to my new self that sometimes I can\u2019t even explain my transformation. Everything has become so natural that if someone asked me how can I be so happy or peaceful, then it\u2019s possible that I wouldn\u2019t know the answer. Happiness just seems to be the natural state for humans. Why should I be miserable? However, that kind of attitude would\u2019ve been a complete utopia many years back, because I felt like the most unfortunate person alive. When i was 9 years old, waiting for one of my best friend\u2019s birthday party after 3rd grade school ceremony. I was also invited to my grandmother\u2019s birthday by my family, but I chose to stay home and go to my friend\u2019s place instead. But before that I went to a nearby shop to buy some snacks. There I met a few friends, who wished for some excitement. I still had about 2 hours until the birthday party so I decided to join them. There was an abandoned and fenceless construction site near my home, which was our typical playground. We had gone there dozens of times before to play games or have a picnic. On that day the four of us decided to play hide and seek, so we split into two teams. We crawled through the hollow spaces of long blocks of concrete, made silent movements and scouted around the place, sometimes lifting our heads up to see where the other boys were located. I felt very excited like normally. Nothing seemed to be different. But suddenly\u2026 after my teammate had finished scouting, he jumped off a concrete block which was insecurely supported by another. The jump caused the block to lose its balance while I was directly in front of it. As soon as I realized that, I was already on the ground face down, noticing only some dust flying around."

I was just a 9-year-old boy, and the block had fallen on my leg. I was scared, but I didn\u2019t know what to do. My friends were calling for help, but I knew no one could hear us. The only thing I could do was to hold my breath and wait for someone to come. My leg was numb, and I felt like I was going to pass out any moment. Time seemed to have stopped. I could hear my heart beating loudly, and my friends\u2019 shouts were distant echoes. I felt like I was in a nightmare, and I couldn\u2019t wake up. It was like my whole life was flashing before my eyes. I was so scared that I didn\u2019t know what to do. My mind was a complete blank. I could feel my body shaking, and my eyes were welling up with tears. I was alone, and I was so scared. I didn\u2019t know if anyone was coming to help"
