        "Summarize the following story in first person: About three months ago me and five friends took a trip to dallas for a convention we had all be looking forward to. We bought the tickets last year about 7 or 8 months ago so for it to finally get here was different. It was even better because two of the friends going i did not get to see often and one had recently moved away. SO we piled 5 people 4 people into my friends car and started the 7 hour drive to dallas. The drive was awful it was hot outside but the company made it not so bad really. We stopped at Bucees and took in the great texas culture getting gas buying food and other things and eventually arrived at our AirBnB. We were the first there and quickly all made sure to choose a room with a single bed in it. Then the others arrived from their flights and it was great and so nice to just see everyone there again and say hi exchange pleasantry's etc. From there we went to the convention center on the first day and stood in a long check in line that made us all want to drive home. But after that it was great seeig all the booths meeting new people relaxing really made it feel like a vacation. That night we all hung out played a drinking game ordered food and really relaxed. Waking up late the next day was expected as we had a bit too much to drink but me and another friend took an uber and went and got some breakfast. The dennys was packed but the pancakes were great. The next day was just as good as the first but without the long checkin lineso we spent the day at the convention center and then went for some food at lunch. We ate  at this great wing restauraunt and had a great time then headed back before going home. That night we found out it was one of our friends birthday so we bought a cake and all sang happy birthday. We hung out at the house played some games and watched movies while having some drinks. Going forward to the last day two friends had to go home but the rest of us spent the day together relaxing and repeating all the last days. Fast forward to monday and it is time for us to head home. The drive was awful but we all had a lot of fun and lying in bed that night i was glad for the great weekend."
