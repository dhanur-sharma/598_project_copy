        "Summarize the following story in first person: I went to an award's ceremony that was for writers in the romance genre. It was at a large national romance conference in New York City. We were at a large ritzy hotel in New York City. The award is called the Ritas and it is the most prestigious industry award ceremony in the genre. We all got dressed up to go to the ceremony. I wore an evening gown with beading and sparkles. Other people wore evening gowns as well. I was part of it because I am part of this organization and I was up for a sister award. It was so excited to be there and have people notice that I was up for an award. I am also among the group that judges these books. During the conference there was a lot of talk about increasing diversity. Although the award had been around for decades, an African American had never won an award. It was a very big deal. During this ceremony it happened. An Afraican American won, and everyone cheered so much. People were crying. After the ceremony, we all took part in a large party. It was a very memorable evening."
