        "Summarize the following story in first person: It's been a really long few months since I lost my job. I have been searching and looking for a new one every day, but it's a tough market out there. Everybody wants a better job, everybody wants and needs more money, and the competition is stiff. The savings that we have is quickly depleting and there isn't much left after this month. I've been depressed and my anxiety is through the roof lately. I need to be able to put food on the table for my kids, and keep a roof over their heads. A few weeks ago I was searching online for what I could possibly do from home at least for something, anything. Any help at this point would be amazing. Extra groceries, phone bill, electric bill, I don't care, it all needs to be paid anyway. I found some sites that seemed like I could do surveys for some cash, but most paid in gift cards, and you seem to need weeks worth of points to be able to earn a gift card. Then I found Mechanical Turk. It's something Amazon controls, so I looked into it and decided to sign up. It was a few days for me to get my approval, and in which time I did some research to find out what kind of jobs I could expect. The answer to that, was a little bit of everything, and sometimes some seriously crazy stuff. I read stories of some of the crazy things people did. By the time I got my approval, I felt fairly ready to jump right in and hopefully start making some money. The first few days to a week were rough, there aren't many jobs available for a new worker, so I worked for literal pennies an hour. But it got my feet wet. After the first few weeks I started getting into the swing of things, and luckily I've been making some better money. This week alone I've made enough for groceries at least. Is it long tedious hours some days? Yep. But you know what? It doesn't matter, because this is only for the short term until I find something else, and at least my kids are being fed. Not being able to afford the basics really does a number to your self-esteem."
