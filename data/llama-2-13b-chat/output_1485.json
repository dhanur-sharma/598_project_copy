        "Summarize the following story in first person: I had experience just a month ago and I am still trying to get over it. We had been down for about 2 months without a vehicle and my husband is a mechanic, but he was staying in doors all day and was not going out till dark and tried to work on it for thirty minutes to an hour.  We are also down one bathroom, the other been under construction for the past 7 years.  My husband was not working on any of it, i am not even going to go into our bathroom. I have bought tools for him, I have gotten him equipment, and I have bought him the materials.  I have gotten so mad, that it actually turned into major depression and I was just so tired and sad that I wished to never wake up most mornings.  When I mentioned doing any of these projects during the day, I was told that he needed more materials of more then one hundred dollars, and with the car he just could not figure it out even thou we had engines that he could but in. I was so mad, angry, hurt and just had given up, every time I looked at him. I had but insurance on another truck that I can not drive, just so I could get to my appointments, without begging for help from my family. I am still trying to recover from that I still can not afford the materials for the rest of the bathroom yet, we are on a very limited income. I am seeing my physiologist once a week now to get back to my normal. I do not know if or when that truck or my blazer will ever get fixed, but at least I do not have to look at them anymore.  They are covered up in weeds so that I can not see them or even see the front of the yard anymore. That is how high the weeds are there is a path to the one truck but that is even getting narrow.  I guess if I do not get things done, then nothing will get done."
