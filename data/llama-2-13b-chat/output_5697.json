        "Summarize the following story in first person: Today, I had a very interesting thing happen to me at work. It involved something that I was hoping that might happen a little later down the line in my career. I guess it was one of those things that really takes you by surprise when it happens a lot sooner than expected. I was pulled aside by my Operations Manager for a little chat. We mainly talked about usual work related stuff and such, nothing too out of the ordinary. He twas telling me about a new position that had opened up for the current lead on the team and that they would be moving on to a different account. I was thought that this was good for them and mentioned that I hope they did well in their new position. My boss then says that it would obviously open up a new spot and that they would need to get someone new to come in. He asked what I thought about this and I just said that I wasn't sure at the moment but that I thought one of my other colleagues could probably step into the position. Then out of no where he just says that he's going to give it to me. At first I thought he was joking but then I saw that he appeared to be serious. I was a little caught off guard by this because I thought that some of the others might be better suited to step into this position. He basically told me that he thought that I had been doing such a good job and that I had shown the ability to do the job. I still felt a little uneasy about it but at the same time I knew that I could take on the challenge if I put the effort into it. I told him that I would gladly accept and that I would do my best. That was the very surprising and super exciting highlight from my day today."
