        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 4 months ago, I lost my best friend, my 16 year old miniature poodle. I know it's silly to call a dog your best friend, but he's been through everything with me. I knew his time was limited, dogs only live to be around 10-15 years old, but it was still the most difficult day of my life. Weeks prior to losing him, I could tell he was going downhill. He wasn't as excited to eat anymore, he had trouble walking, he completely lost his eyesight. It was hard, watching him go through that. I didn't know if I should be the one to put him down, or hope that maybe he would pass peacefully in his sleep one night. As time went on, I could really see him begin to go downhill. I woke up one morning and found blood in his crate, knowing something was wrong I took him to the vet. They couldn't see any cuts on him, and explained that he may be bleeding from his anus. I asked if maybe he ate something sharp, and they said it was possible but to watch him and see if he continues to do it. So I watched him, and he bled every time he went to go potty. He began to throw up after every time he ate, he didn't know where he was half the time. At one point I picked him up and he bit me, not because I had hurt him, but because he was starting to lose his mind. We knew it was time to put him down, and I hysterics. How could I go to the vets office, and not come back with him? How could I be the one to take my best friend out of this world? How could I stand there for one second and him be there with me, and the next he's gone. The day he bit me was the day I called the vets office and made the appointment, after I hung up I just sat down and cried. That night and the following morning I considered canceling the appointment, but hours before we were supposed to go in it looked like he had a seizure. I held him the entire time to make sure he didn't hurt himself, and once he was done I made him comfortable until it was time. We brought him in, and they drugged him so he was out of it. I didn't leave his side the entire time, I wasn't going to leave him alone. He had been there for me my entire life, so I was going to be there for him. I hugged him one last time while the vet injected him with two different shots, and I saw the light leave his eyes."
