        "Summarize the following story in first person: This was a significant moment in my life as I was basically reconnected with my father that I barely knew.  It was mostly memorable because it was the first time we told each other, \"I love you.\" I'm 35 years old so this was significant to me. I always wanted to have a relationship with him and I was happy when he reached out to me. Now we talk on a regular basis and have kind of formed a bond. It's very interesting to hear his side of things because all I ever knew was what my mother told me. None of which were positive things. So, I grew up having a somewhat negative view of him since I automatically believed what my mom told me about him. I also have always kind of been the \"black sheep\" of my family. It was nice to meet someone so much like me. Even though we never really knew each other, we are so much alike! It a little refreshing to hear some of his stories. I look forward to getting to know him better as he has really helped to push me through a difficult time in my life. He helped me in immeasurable ways and really stood out as being sincere and unconditional. Now, I have a positive view of him and understand why my mom would always say I was \"just like him.\" I kind of just laugh about it now because what can you really do? Not much, so laugh."
