I started to feel weary a little bit before that, but it got really bad on that day. I needed to be driven to the ER. I hated that I chose that day to get sick, but there's never going to be a good day to get sick, I suppose. My roommate was there from the time I was admitted to the time I got out of there. It was incredible. They showed incredible resolve and love for me. It was from an area of caring. There was no ulterior motive. If there was, wow did they hide it well. Imagine if this selflessness was commonplace in the world. This should happen more often. We should look out for our own more often. It doesn't happen enough. I plan on showing the same level of care if God forbid something happens to them."
