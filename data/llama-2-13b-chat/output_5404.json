        "Summarize the following story in first person: I recently found out that my mother was moving away from Minnesota to Missouri for six months. This was very shocking as it was short notice and all of her family is here in Minnesota. I honestly feel rather hurt that she has the desire to be so far away from family, especially because my son will probably start walking while she is gone and I feel she is missing out on a lot. She did this once before when my siblings and me were still kids and I feel like that left an emotional scar that she is opening again by leaving again. She can be a very controlling and hurtful person, so I feel like I should be happy that she is leaving but I am not. I feel abandoned. She once told me a story about how when she was growing up her father made her feel abandoned. He would say he was going to come pick her up, and she would sit on the curb outside her house waiting with her luggage. She would sit there for hours and he would never show up. Now when I think about that story I feel bitter. She has done the very same thing to her family. She leaves on a whim with almost no notice and is gone for months. This will be the third time she has done this. She even knowingly missed my sons birth. He is her only grandson. She says she's excited about him and then leaves and misses out on his milestones. I feel very hurt by her."
