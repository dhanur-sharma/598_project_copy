I was really scared when the boss called me in--i've only been here for a year, you see, and I had only recently gotten off the probationary period. He looked at me with a serious face and told me to site down--that it was important. I was almost about to cry--my career was over. But then he smiled and told me 'Congrats.' He informed me that I was chosen by him as first in line for a promotion, and that I should expect to be instated within the next few weeks. I was so happy, I could've still cried. I might've a little. Since then, I have started my new position and I couldn't be happier. I've been a great worker, and I felt that I deserved this, but this soon? It's amazing! I told all my friends and everyone was so supportive of me. I'm all smiles--if this could happen now, what does that mean for the future? I'm an ambitious person, and I cant wait to prove myself even more! Anyway, gotta get to work now!"
