        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was unable to go to the 4th of July with my family this year. One of my friends offered to take me to a fireworks show in another county with some of her friends. We hung out for a bit beforehand, and then we went on the freeway to get to her friends' apartment. We talked about a bunch of fun stuff on the way. Then we met up with her friends, and I got to meet their cats. We went to the fireworks show, and the music selection was as bad as if someone had just searched for the acronym \"USA\" in a bunch of songs and set fireworks to the results. The fireworks were cool, though. On the way back to the train station, I felt like I needed to talk about the anxiety that I had been having lately. After listening to my experiences, she asked if I was okay, and talked about what she does to handle her anxiety. I was worried about having a panic attack on the train that night, so she drove me home instead, even though that was kind of expensive for her. She sent me a guide to some of her methods for helping with anxiety through text later. I felt so comforted by knowing that she dealt with that, too. I felt like someone was looking out for me, and I felt like the place I lived in felt like home. As opposed to my parent's home, which didn't feel like home with the 4th of July thing. I feel like we became much closer friends after that."
