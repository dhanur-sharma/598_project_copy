        "Summarize the following story in first person: As I was getting ready to put my son to bed I had time to reflect on what a bad day it had been. My son had been acting wild all day while I had been dealing with trying to get work done. It was frustrating attempting to get him to calm down enough to actually go to bed. He put up a small argument when I told him finally that it was bed time. However, after a couple of minutes, he conceded to bedtime. He laid down on the bed and I put his blanket on him. He then got very quiet and asked me a question.\"Dad, am I good?\" I couldn't help but answer, \"Most of the time. I really wish you would act better, though.\" It was then he hit me with one of the more profound things I've ever heard. \"Daddy, I have to be bad so I can be good in the future. \" I asked him, \"Why is that?\" \"Because, Daddy. If you don't have a past, you can't ever have a future.\" As much as I wanted to debate him and show him how he was technically wrong, that at any point he wanted he could decide to be good, I couldn't help but be amazed at the fact that he was right. My son just laid there, looking confident in what he was saying. Ever since he said it, I've been completely unable to shake it from my mind. I can't help but feel there's a lesson there for everybody."
