        "Summarize the following story in first person: This happened about two months ago, but i was offered a surprise promotion at work! I had talked with my operations manager about it and they gave me the position without any hesitation or issues. It all started when I worked hard at my job for a good five years. I work at a rug factory as a creeler. My job consists of loading the machines with the different colors of thread for different rugs at the right time. I work a good ten to twelve shifts and never missed a day or have ever been late. It is hard work but I have always made decent money. I noticed that the floor manager position had just opened up recently. I know that they make so much more money and all you have to do is sit their and manage the other creelers. I went in and asked the operations manager about that position and they said \"it's all yours. you start on Monday!\" He told me that my pay was to increase by ten thousand a year and the only thing I have to do is make sure that they do their jobs. Also if someone calls out then I would have to take over if no one else could cover the shift. I was so excited that I went out and celebrated that night at the bar with other co-workers. They all were very glad to have me as their boss. I was glad to take the position!"
