        "Summarize the following story in first person: I work in a school and always have the month of July off. I live about 5 and a half hours from my parents where I grew up and we don't have very much disposable income. Due to this, I often do not get to visit and my kids miss out on some quality time with their grandparents. My parents are very proud grandparents and very active when they are with my kids. I got a small bonus this summer and used it to go visit my parents so the kids could have some time to spend with them. We had a lot of fun throughout the whole time including spending time at the local lake for my mom's 70th birthday. This resulted in my kids playing some mini golf, fishing, and paddle boating all day long in the hot summer sun. We had water balloon fights and went out for ice cream and visited the specialty vintage toy and horror shop. My kids loved all of this and I loved all of this. There were so many other things that sparked a lot of joy during this visit. However, there was one thing we did on two different nights that brought me the most overwhelming positive emotion. My mom grabbed an old mayo jar in the evening one evening and my parents, my wife, me, and all 4 of my kids ran around at dusk in their big yard on the edge of the forest and caught fireflies until we couldn't see anything anymore (no street lights out there). Over the course of this, there were so many laughs and amazingly funny screams from the smallest kids when bugs landed on them. We saw bats flying around in the last sliver of daylight as well which sparked even more excitement. I felt like a kid again and loved being outside with everyone. It helped me hold onto my youth a little bit longer and made me appreciate my family and my parents even more."
