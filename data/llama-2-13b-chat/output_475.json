        "Summarize the following story in first person: I have loved my promotion. Although I am held to higher standards now, I receive more money. It isn't just about the money, though, because I also am looked at with more esteem as well. People come to me with questions that they need help with. People come to me needing advice on how to work certain cases. It feels truly incredible. My supervisor constantly praises me and makes me feel good to be an employee overall. I love working at my job. The only negative aspect is that now since I'm held to higher standards, making mistakes is seen as worse than if I made a mistake in my older position. I have now been at the job for 11 months, and will be celebrating my 1 year anniversary next month. I can't wait to spend more time at this job. They treat me well, and I have a lot of security here. Everyone is so proud of me. Even my mom, as well as my wife are so proud. It feels so good to live right now."
