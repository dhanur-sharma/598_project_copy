        "Summarize the following story in first person: So, about a month ago, as I was looking through my calls for the day, I saw something horrifying on my call list. I sent a call to me ex. I don't know how it happened. I can only assume it was an accidental butt dial. In any case, we ended on bad terms. She was totally unreliable and flaky. I was always convinced she was cheating on me. I never wanted to speak to her again. I could only hope that she ignored the call and didn't want to talk to me either. However, the next day, there it was. A phone call from her. I looked at it as it was ringing. I figured I should just answer it and tell her it was a mistake rather than let her think I was pining over her but too scared to talk to her. I answered the phone. Her phone brought back horrible memories, but still felt like home to me. I told her it was a mistake that I called her. She thought that I meant that I meant to call her but I regretted it. She said we should meet up, catch up on old times. I don't know why, but I agreed. She always had a power over me. I showed up at the coffee shop dressed to the nines. I don't even know what I was doing. Did I want her back? I sat down and waited. She never showed, and I was glad."
