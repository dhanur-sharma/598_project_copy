        "Summarize the following story in first person: My cat has been stumbling around some lately, and I picked him up a few weeks ago to see if there was anything obviously wrong. I looked him over a bit and found something wrong with his eyes. Actually I should say his eye - he only has one good eye, having lost the other one in a fight with another neighborhood cat. I looked and found a cloudy red spot on his good eye which looked like the storm on the surface of Jupiter. I took him to the vet to see what was going on, and the vet determined it was most likely ocular cancer. My cat doesn't seem to be in any obvious pain, but he is getting about much more carefully and not with the confidence he used to have. But, he does seem to be enjoying himself and not having a rough life, despite the clumsiness and reduced vision. With that said, the cancer is likely to spread, which leaves me with a difficult decision to make. Do I have the remaining good eye removed, thus making my cat blind, or do I take a wait and see approach and see if the cancer does indeed spread, possibly risking my cat's life? It seems that no matter what decision I make it will negatively affect my cat's quality of life. He's about 13 years old and not really a youngster, but he probably still has a few good years left in him if the cancer doesn't spread into other parts of his body. I'm not sure how good those years will be, though, if he's blind. He likes being outside a lot and kind of comes and goes as he pleases, and I fear blinding him will take that away from him. I live near a pretty busy road and I think he could get hit by a car if his vision is impaired. As of now, I've not made any decisions one way or the other. The cat is sticking around the house a bit more than usual, so my fears of removing his good eye may be unfounded - he may have figured out on his own that home is a safe place for him to be. He's always been a clever animal though, so this doesn't surprise me. I wish he were just a bit more clever though, so maybe he could tell me what I need to do for him."
