        "Summarize the following story in first person: Two weeks ago, I was feeling particularly stressed after work. I couldn't wind down, I couldn't relax, I couldn't stop thinking about my day that day, and everyday forward, showing back up to that same old place. I decided to head outside, pop my headphones in, and take a stroll. As I walked along, I tried to focus on my breathing. In, and out it went, slowly synchronizing with my steps and the harmony of the music in my ears. In and out, with every exhale I left more and more of the workday behind. Forgetting the stress, the ungrateful clients and thankless work, and the dull boredom pounding at the back of my head. I'm not sure how much time passed by... maybe minutes or hours. All I can say, without a doubt, is a few laps around the block later I felt relatively at ease. Yes, I had to go back the next day and do it all again. However, at least for the moment I didn't have to worry about that. I could return home, kick my feet up, and focus on myself for the moment. Maybe I'll crack open a beer and catch up on some reading, or just chat with my friends. Who knows, it doesn't matter. Let's take it day by day."
