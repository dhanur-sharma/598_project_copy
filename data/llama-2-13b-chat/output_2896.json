        "Summarize the following story in first person: Today, I learned that an ex girlfiend of mine has stage 3 breast cancer.  She and I were together shortly after high-school, and though the relationship didn't end all that well, I thought of her often.  We had some good times and she was around for a part of my life when I really needed someone.  She moved on, as did I.  She moved to another state, got married.  I remained here, got married and had kids of my own.  Even though, I still frequently thought of her and the good times we had.  Hearing this news today really hit me - I keep thinking back to high school, the good times we had and the adventures we went on.  Now that I'm middle aged, I think of my own mortality (I'm healthy), but this really hit me hard to hear she is dying - literally dying.  Her prognosis is not good.  I'm not sure exactly how to feel, or whatI should feel, if I should reach out or not...Things didn't end well but I still care for her, even after 20 years has gone by.  I saw her picture and she is as gorgeous as I remember.  Tough day all around.  I guess I didn't know just how hard news like this would hit me.  I'm feeling a little confused and not quite sure how to process all this."
