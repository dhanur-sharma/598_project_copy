        "Summarize the following story in first person: An important event that really started to make me have memories would be crossing the road with my new puppy. You see, not too long ago we bought a puppy and he was very nice. However, the only thing he was scared of was the fact that there are things that look like cars. He doesn't know what they are, keep in mind he is still very young. But at the end of the day we pushed him to his limits so that he can overcome these things. After a while, the dog learned to not chase cars nor bite on their wheels. As a result, this meant that our dog is one dog that is not scared of anything in this life making him immune to the most compelling emotions of fear. As a result, this made me love the dog much more because that meant something. The more I think about it, the more my heart is filled with joy throughout the decades. I have never imagined that I would have a dog. And nevermind actually have a dog that lets me motivate him to do things that I never thought he could do. I guess that is another part of life that we must account for. Everything that is alive is capable of learning even rocks can do that too. For example rocks have the capacity to morph due to heat and temperature. To us it would be a different thing however at the end of the day it is exactly the same stressors that make up who we are."
