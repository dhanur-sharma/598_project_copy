        "Summarize the following story in first person: My friend and I were really close for a period of high school and college before there was a period were things just felt different to the both of us. This story is really timely because he was actually almost going to be in the city that I live in this weekend and we were going to spend some time hanging out which would have been really nice. Things were strained for a period that felt long where we didn't talk or hang out as much and you could just tell that we were not as close as we had been in the past. There were times where we would actually yell at each other and get in this big blow up fights. Our relationship felt much more competitive and cut throat than it was before which was strange. Then a while back I got a wedding invitation in the mail which started the events that would change things back to the way things were. The way things were when things were good and we really felt like best friends. I think I mentioned before that I would still text him when I was back in town but we didn't always hang out or if we did it still felt weird. For whatever reason things were way different this time when we were hanging out the night before his wedding. We talked about things like we used to and there was an openness that reminded me of the past. We stayed up really late and both felt really happy, we didn't need to hash out everything that happened before because we had talked about it a lot. It was a lot of fun and then we got to hang out a few more times after that during the time after the wedding/reception. From the time past that point we communicate a lot more which I think continues to help. I really make it a point to do that because there were some long period in the past where we would kind of \"ghost\" each other. Now I feel like I can go back to my home town and hit him up with no problems or second guessing like before. I am really glad things went back because we are close and have tons of memories to share."
