WINNING THE JOB WOULD MEAN SIGNIFICANT REVENUES TO OUR COMPANY. WE ARE PRIVATELY OWNED AND THE OWNER PICKED A GROUP TO PREPARE THE PROPOSAL. THERE WAS A TEAM OF THREE. I WAS SELECTED AS THE TEAM LEADER. WE SPENT COUNTLESS HOURS PREPARING THE PROPOSAL. WE PRESENTED IT TO THE OWNER AND HE FELT IT WAS NOT AGGRESSIVE ENOUGH. THE CHANGES HE SUGGESTED MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO EARN A PROFIT AND I KNEW IT. I TRIED TO CHANGE HIS OPINION BUT I GAVE UP. WE WON THE PROPOSAL AND THE FINANCIAL LOSS. THE LOSS WE SUFFERED CAUSED THE COMPANY TO LAY OFF A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE. MY FRIENDS AND COWORKERS LOST THEIR JOB. I FELT AWFUL. I DID NOT STAND MY GROUND AND GAVE IN SO EASILY. I AM ASHAMED AND EMBARRASSED TO THIS DAY. I KNOW I SHOULD HAVE STOOD MY GROUND. IF THE OWNER DID NOT AGREE I SHOULD HAVE THREATENED TO QUIT MY JOB AND IT THAT DID NOT WORK QUIT AND LOOK FOR ANOTHER JOB. I WILL NOT GET A CHANCE TO GO BACK AND THAT IS SOMETHING I WILL HAVE TO LIVE WITH THE REST OF MY LIFE."
