        "Summarize the following story in first person: A little while ago me and a few friends wanted to do something different for the weekend. we normally do the samethings during the weekend so that's why we wanted to change things. we had a conversation about a few ideas on what we could do. there were a few good ideas but we had to bring down to one. we'd probably do another the following week. This time we decided to go out and see some bands perform. This was different because we haven't really been to a concert. This is about as close as i've ever been to one. I thought it would be fun however. we went out and had some drinks watched a few bands perform live. we had a pretty good time we were all jamming and lifted. The only problem is something should be done to get to the good part. It takes a while for the bands to actually start playing. That's the best part drinking and listening just the time waiting beforehand is an issue. Overall we had a good time and new experience."
