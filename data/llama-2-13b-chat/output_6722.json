        "Summarize the following story in first person: A lot of the things that we talked about had to do with how to cope with his eventual passing. That one was hard for me but it was a reality that I had to remember and not forget, he seemed to cope with well it. He told me that he literally was okay with death. I guess because had dealt with it and made peace with the outcome that was going to happen no matter what. We also talked about what I could do after he passed to become a man. He wanted what was best for me, He wanted to see my grow and do better as a person overall. I appreciated everything he did for me. I also appreciated him trying to make the most out of a bad situation. I feel most people wouldn't be able to do that, but my uncle was a strong minded person. You rarely, if ever would see him feeling down about himself or week about something. He knew that life was never always going to be great and peaches and roses. But he would make the best of each and every scenario possible. That's one thing I will miss about him and forever remember, just how strong of a person he was inside. He was like a second father to me with how he treated me and did stuff for me and with me. I could never forget any of the conversations we had that night. I swear we talked for at least 3 hours just about life, the future, the past. Literally just everything you could think of, we discussed."
