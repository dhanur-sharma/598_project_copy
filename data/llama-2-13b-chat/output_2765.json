        "Summarize the following story in first person: The date was April 22, 2019. I was feeling down and decided to gamble an amount of money that most people would never dream of gambling. That amount was 3,000 dollars. While 3,000 dollars may not seem like a lot to most, it was a lot of money for me at the time (and even now). It was a Monday evening, and I saw that the Houston Rockets were playing the Utah Jazz. I wanted to bet on Houston because they had near-even odds (3,000 to win nearly 3,000 back, which would result in me having 6,000 in total) and because they had a 3-0 lead in the series. I had a strong feeling that Houston was going to win this game, so I bit the bullet and dropped the bet. It was a nightmare from the beginning. Houston was already down more than five points after the first quarter. I was already in a state of shock at this point, despite there being three quarters left. I already felt hopeless after the first quarter. After the second quarter I felt that it wasn't the end of the world because there was still a lot of time left and it was only about a five point game. Then the third quarter came along... Houston had a great third quarter and even took the lead. While my anxiety wasn't gone at this point yet, I felt a lot more calm than I did after the first quarter. I felt that Houston was gonna seal the deal, as they only needed one more quarter to win. Then the fourth quarter happened... It was an absolute nightmare and Utah absolutely crushed Houston. All of my hope went down the drain when this quarter began. It seemed as if Houston didn't even care anymore and wanted to throw the game away. At the end of the day, Utah won by more than 10 points and I was in absolute shambles. I couldn't believe what I saw and negative thoughts were the only thing on my mind. I had no more money to my name and was contemplating many things.  After this event, I kept gambling until I realized that this would ruin my life if I didn't stop. While I haven't stopped entirely, I am progressing towards stopping as I am gambling much less and much less frequently. I believe that this addiction can be stopped with time and effort."
