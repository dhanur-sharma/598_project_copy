        "Summarize the following story in first person: I remember listening to my sister-in-law get so excited when my niece started to use the \"potty\". It was not just an off hand comment referencing a moment of pride but a continual referral back to no more late night night changes and loads of soiled laundry. I was somewhere in my early twenties enjoying the freedom of university life and had no idea why she was so excited. Fast forward several years and I can now say I get it.    As of two weeks ago I can now say that my child is potty trained during the day. I am on the ten yard line with a \"No diapers\" future in sight. Her dad keeps praising her and that's great but I think he is forgetting the MVP right in front of him. As primary caregiver thus far it has been me changing the diapers and more recently cleaning the carpet and floors from \"almost made-its\". I have been immersed in conversation after conversation related to bathroom habits. \"It is time to go to the potty. You need to try\". These phrases have been on repeat for the past month. A MONTH.  I don't know these magical people that have trained their children in twenty-four hours constantly touting their successes on the web but I am pretty sure they are bots. No matter, my hair is growing back and I am moving on. It is my turn to turn to anyone who will listen, \"I AM SO HAPPY! My child is now potty trained (during the day). I have had the same box of diapers for a month now! I am jumping up and down inside with a smile plastered on my face. My kid has made it to the Superbowl and her coach brought her there."
