        "Summarize the following story in first person: My wife has been trying to convince me to start streaming on Twitch and I finally took the plunge a few months ago. Just this week out of nowhere I got a ton of new follows and went from being a small nobody stream to a not too small not quite a nobody stream with a couple hundred follows and an eighty viewer average. It was at this moment that I realized that maybe I actually could make streaming into something. Apparently people like to watch me once they discover me and find my brand of humor amusing. My wife is currently my only moderator but this also means she's watching my streams when I'm playing and we've grown closer because of the sheer amount of stupid twitch chat/streaming involves. Last weekend I got a dono from someone that touched me. In it they talked about how they'd been going through a rough time of their lives because their parents had gotten in a car wreck while they were on vacation. They had both lived but their father had gotten paralyzed. He'd been depressed since the accident since he'd always been an active man but now couldn't do that anymore. His father asked him what he was watching and he showed him the stream and they wound up watching me for the entire three hours I was streaming that night. His father's mood apparently improved and he even asked when the next time I'd be streaming is and asked his son if they could watch me together again. I'd never thought that doing something as silly as playing video-games and just shooting the shit with random people in my chat could help. I'm glad to find out I was mistaken though and even if it's just a guy and his father I'm happy to say it at least helped two people. My wife however is living the \"I told you so\" dream at this point and keeps rubbing in that I should have started sooner. Now if only my father was still around so I could join the \"I told you so\" bandwagon since he always said \"You can't make money playing video-games\"."
