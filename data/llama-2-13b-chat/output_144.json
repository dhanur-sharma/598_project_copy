        "Summarize the following story in first person: That was a very special day in my life because it was one of the largest accomplishments for me and my family. I woke up very nervous and sort of sick to my stomach but in a good way. I was afraid that something would somehow go wrong and I wasn\u2019t going to get to graduate. The morning started with breakfast with family and hanging out with my wife and brother. We then went back to the hotel and got ready by showering and getting some good clothes on. We met up with the he rest of the family for photos which took about an hour. After photos we went tot he auditorium and the ceremony started shortly after 2 pm I believe. It was about an hour long but it seemed to last forever. At some point the nerves went away and I was just happy to have finished a very hard phd and happy that I made my parents Proud. The rest of the day was also very positive. We had dinner as a family at a nice restaurant. We then sat and talked for a few hours. I told my family stories of the struggles and tough times during those five years. The offered feedback and told me I had done a great job. I admit this felt so good! It meant to much to be able to accomplish this for everyone that helped me along the way. It was a top moment in my life for sure"
