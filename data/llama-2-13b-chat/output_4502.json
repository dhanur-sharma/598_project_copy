        "Summarize the following story in first person: A few months ago i got in a argument with a friend. We were drinking and he was being mean to me. Ive been picked on by some of my friends over my lifetime. I think he  thought he was joking around but i got really upset. He was making fun of my voice for the way i talk. He was doing it at a bar in front of a group of people. I got mad and challenged him to fight. We have since made up and i told him its ok lets move on. But i really dont want to associate with him any more. Im a grown man and some of my friends from when i was younger im discovering are not good people. Also too much of what of what my old friends always want to do is drink. I struggle moving on because its hard to make new friends. But im realizing im a different person and want to be around different people. While it was just a small fight it kind of led to think about my life and who i want to be around. Ive been hanging out with my family more and more these days."
