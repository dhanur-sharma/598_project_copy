        "Summarize the following story in first person: Two months ago I had the honor and privilege to work as an intern for the immigration clinic in my home state.  The work was very hard but rewarding.  There is one case in my mind that sticks out in particular and that is the case of Client. (name omitted).  Every week, the intern group would head to local facilities where immigrants seeking asylum were held.  The group would give a presentation to the detainees about the services we provided and their rights as detainees.  At the end of the presentation,  one man walked directly up to me and began telling me his story.  The man said that he was from Eritrea.  He had been a professor there, and was persecuted for speaking out against the local government.  He had been jailed in a facility without windows for seven months and was subsequently released to return to work as a professor, this time with government agents sitting in on all of his lectures.  After one session in particular, Client felt as if he was going to be arrested and imprisoned again, and he set out to flee Eritrea, which he did successfully.  With the help of a false passport (his home government had confiscated his), and extended travels through three countries, Client arrived in America where he was subsequently detained.  After hearing his story, I decided to take him on as a client to help him gain asylum.  Over the course of 4 weeks I studied endlessly, learning everything there was to know about Client and asylum laws. A great deal of time was also spent with Client rehearsing the details of his long and harrowing journey and detailing the precise reasons he needed to be granted asylum.  At the end of the four weeks, the moment of truth arrived.  I entered the courtroom with Client and waited patiently.  After what seemed to be an eternity, our case was finally in front of the judge.  They called Client to the stand and we began the direct examination.  The examination was perfect.  Everything that Client and I had prepared for was executed seamlessly.  We were so thorough and convincing that the other examining party had minimal questions for Client and gave minimal push back to the idea that asylum was absolutely necessary for my client.  We received the news last month that Client has been granted asylum, and I can honestly say that hearing that news was one of the greatest moments of my life."
