        "Summarize the following story in first person: In April I traveled with my husband to Miami to visit my niece and family. We celebrated my sister's 74 birthday.  We drove down and spent one night on the road both coming and going.  We had a great time with all of them. We toured a lighthouse.  We played games and watched movies and took walks. We also played with a two year old and found out that another one is on the way. We had some great food. We had a low country boil in honor of my sister's birthday. We had some great fried rice. We visited an outlet mall and enjoyed walking around and seeing all the bargains. The traffic was bad coming home. If they didn't live in such a hot area of the country we might move there. We enjoyed being with them a lot. Maybe we will go back next year. Or maybe we should plan a trip for Dec. when the new baby is born."
