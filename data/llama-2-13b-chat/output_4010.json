        "Summarize the following story in first person: Dear Diary,About two and a half months ago, my little family became complete. I became an aunt, actual blood related aunt. My brother and his wife gave birth to a baby boy the day after my late best friend's birthday. His birth on this date was very special to me because it was like he was a gift sent from heaven. It was almost like my best friend that had taken his life a few months ago had looked down on me, saw how sad I was, and decided that this beautiful little boy was exactly what I needed to help alleviate the relentless grief that I have been feeling. Little Ben was born a couple weeks early, and happy and healthy. He truly was a wonderful blessing to our family. I find it amusing that he has the same ears and blues eyes as my late best friend. Ben has only been in this world for two months and my life has already seemed to gotten better with him in it. I look forward to the new memories I will make with my new nephew. I am now happy that the future will be possible for new and happy memories to be made. It helps to take focus off of all the future memories that I lost when my friend died. Ben is the best thing to happen to my family. He is such a sweet and well behaved baby. I love that he was hand picked as my nephew."
