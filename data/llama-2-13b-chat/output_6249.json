When the job opportunity came up, it seemed just right for me. I prepared. I researched the company. I was in a great mood, and confident, knowledgeable, and friendly at the interview. I looked the part. I asked the right questions. I liked my interviews, and I could tell they liked me. As you remember, I got a second interview. I was so stoked! Well, I have to tell you, during that second interview, I felt more scrutinized. Something felt off. Two days later, I got an email. My dream job was given to another applicant. I was crushed. A week later, the rejection still stings. What can I do? Time to brush myself off, get on my feet, and hit the pavement to find my next gig."
