        "Summarize the following story in first person: A week ago Sunday I celebrated my 46th Birthday. It was so much fun, which is crazy, because I expected the age to hit me and make me depressed! I spent the whole day outside and oh what a warm beautiful day it was! I have always been spoiled having nice weather on my birthday. The first thing we did was shoot our guns. My best friend brought over targets and we had a contest. I ended up second which was fine. My oldest son beat me just by a little which made me quite proud. Everyone who came to celebrate with me brought a dish to pass. We had quite the feast going! There was lasagna, salad, cookies, cake, pie of all kinds, tacos, pizza, juice, soda and so much more. I ate more than I should have but it was totally worth it. Before the party was over we decided to draft our fantasy football players. Most of us were in a league together. The people that were not in the league simply didn't play. I got mostly who I wanted with a few hiccups. I hope to do it all again next year."
