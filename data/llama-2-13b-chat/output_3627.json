        "Summarize the following story in first person: We were out deep in the woods. It was the best time I can remember. The girls, my granddaughters were having a wonderful time. The made faces at each other while I cooked. We had a great dinner and then we told ghost stories. The girls got a little scared, but they comforted each other and made each other laugh. While they were making each other laugh, they made me laugh too. We all got a good night's sleep and woke up early. We went for a hike and even caught some fish. The girls were tired but were still having a great time. We all went together to a waterfall, walking underneath it as a group. We got soaking wet but it was so great. We just laughed and had a great time. We walked back to camp that night and toasted marshmallows. The girls didn't know it, it was a surprise, but I had brought along chocolate bars to make smores. We stayed up late eating smores and talking and then in the morning drove home."
