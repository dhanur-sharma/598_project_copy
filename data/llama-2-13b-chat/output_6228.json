        "Summarize the following story in first person: April 10th of this year i became a father for the first time in my life. My wife and i had a beautiful baby boy. We were worried about being not able to experience this moment because my spouse had rough time during the whole pregnancy. We were worried about her not being able to conceive a healthy childIt was first child for both of us. Both of our parents were at the hospital to witness this amazing day for our family. I have heard other people mention how becoming a parent changes your life and i always used to brush off as people are being too dramatic. But after becoming a father i actually realized how i was wrong to dismiss people feeling.  It is the greatest feeling i have experienced in my life. It has given a new purpose to my life. Everyday i look forward to go home after work and spend time with my son. I am a very sensitive sleeper. But now since we had our baby, I don't even mind waking up at night to feed the baby or even to change the diapers. I would cherish this day for the rest of my life. Being a father has given new meaning to my life. It has made me want to work harder so i can provide more for my family."
