        "Summarize the following story in first person: My family and I have often gone on vacation to different camping sites all throughout my life. This summer we went to the smokey mountains to stay at a charming log cabin only a few minutes walk from excellent hiking trails. We spent a lot of our time fishing in the streams nearby. We caught a lot of different fish and even some crayfish in crab catchers. We had wonderful seafood meals each night as the whole family helped with fishing. My youngest nephew Johnny, surprised me the most with out eager he was to go fishing. He had said in the past how he hated doing anything outdoors. I am curious as to why his attitude changed so much. I feel that he has a newfound appreciation for nature which is something that our family truely enjoys. It gave me an opportunity to have something to bond with him over which was an opportunity that came quite rare in the past. I had a lot of fun on this camping trip and wish that my family was able to go more often than once a year. I miss spending time with my parents and seeing them laugh. Despite their health problems, whenever we go camping a brightness of joy always shines on their faces. My parents need these trips more than anyone they past few years. These camping trips make everyone so happy and sometimes dont want them to end."
