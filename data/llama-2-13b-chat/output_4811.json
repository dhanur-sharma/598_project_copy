        "Summarize the following story in first person: We have gotten to see so many things while out in Las Vegas.  The top of the Stratosphere was one of my favorite attractions.  Being on top of the Stratosphere at night was amazing, there were so many lights and even helicopters flying by!  Another attraction we had gone to was the LINQ.  We had a great time on the LINQ since my wife and I were put on the capsule that had the open bar!  I had never gotten so drunk in 30 minutes before it was crazy.  The best day I think was one of our last days.   The day consisted of going to the spa and getting a facial cleaning and a massage.  It was not on the strip or really \"Sin City\" oriented but I loved getting the relaxing spa day.  We had also spent so much time eating.  We had gone down to Fremont and it was 9:30pm we decided to eat at the buffet.  It was seafood night and we did not realize we spent 2 hours eating.  The weed was also another great thing to have.  The first time I had been in Las Vegas cannabis had been illegal but this time it definitely was legal.  I cant wait to go back again!"
