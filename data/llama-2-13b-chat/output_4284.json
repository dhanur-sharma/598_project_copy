        "Summarize the following story in first person: My brother and sister in law came down to visit us in FL when we had a place right near the beach. Their kids came with them, and everyone stayed at our beach house for the week. We had a great time together. We went to a lot of restaurants - ones they do not have access to in Alaska, where they live. They got to try fresh mahi mahi and other fish from warm, southern waters. They most they get is cod and salmon, although they get them fresh as well. My sister in law also wanted to do a lot of shopping. She loves the Florida beach look, so we did a lot of shopping in nice gift shops and such. She bought a lot of decor and gifts for people, stuff that really represents the beach look and sand and surf. They have ocean in Alaska, obviously, but definitely not the white sand and warm beach waters that we have here!  She also bought a lot of beach-type clothing, but since not is really appropriate for cold and snowy weather, she bought a lot of sweatshirts that said \"Florida\" on them. We spent a lot of time at the beach, which is my favorite thing to do. We showed them how to surf cast and fish for whiting and pompano and bluefish and sheepshead. We also took out our boat several times, and my sister in law caught a small black-tip shark! They really had a fun time, as did we. My brother in law even got me jogging again, since he is a competitive mountain runner and had to keep running while with us. He said the soft sand gave him a great workout! It was a really busy week, and it was a bit exhausting toward the end, but that's how it should be when friends and family come to visit. It was relaxing at times and harried at others, but all in all we had a fantastic time and can't wait to visit them in Alaska and continue our adventures. There is nothing like being with family and we want to continue to do this every year."
