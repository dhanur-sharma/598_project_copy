I really don't know what to do now that they are gone, they've been me for all of my childhood and the beginning of my early adulthood. I lost my childhood dog last month. They died of old age. I should be grateful for that. Grateful they died at least of old age versus an accident or disease. But all I really feel is this sadness that they are gone. This sadness that its so unfair. why do dogs live for such a short time? Why can't they live just as long as us? Why are they so special and loving? Why can they even be best friends? It's a little cruel right. So sad to have them for just such a little short piece of time."
