        "Summarize the following story in first person: In August of 2019 I visited friends in detroit. They were friends that I've had for several years, but this was the first time we would be meeting in person. We met playing League of Legends online, and we are all fans of the professional scene of that game as well. So when finals were going to be hosted in Detroit it seemed like a perfect time to visit both my friends, and also go see this event I've loved so much live. We went to Little Ceasers arena and got to watch one of our favorite teams battle it out against the top team in North America. I don't go to a lot of sporting events so it was novel for me to get swept up in a cheering crowd or scream when something awesome happened on stage. Unfortunately they lost but the games were close. My favorite moment was getting to hear one of my favorite songs live and hear the stadium hum and sing along to it. Although a close second was getting to go backstage. We didn't get to meet any of the professional players, but we got to meet the tour manager. Backstage was amazing to see, they basically had to set up a whole home office just for a weekend. Besides just the event, I got to play games with my friends in person and hang out in their houses, and I loved every moment of it. I also brought my dog with because I talk to him constantly while I'm in a call with my friends so it felt right that they would finally get to meet him. The drive there and back was long, about 12 hours both ways. But I didn't mind it because I listened to podcasts the whole way. I did make the mistake of listening to a murder podcast just as it was getting dark, so that actually did make me a little anxious."
