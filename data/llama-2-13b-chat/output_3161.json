        "Summarize the following story in first person: My Father was a strange man. He liked to call himself transient. The rest of us called him a homeless drifter. After several attempts at a failed relationship, we had lost contact some years ago. That was, until he appeared at our doorstep out of the blue. The same rough around the edges man, he was frail and thin. His eyes were sunken and he seemed sad. Cancer, he announced, had had its way with him. From that moment on, he moved in, and we tried to make the most of our remaining time. It quickly became evident that we had nothing in common. He didn't believe in corporate America and disapproved of my straight lace financial job. My Mother couldn't stand to be around him and he lectured her on how she gave in to the patriarchy. The few months we had together were a disaster. When he finally passed, we were instructed to contact his girlfriend- of whom we had never even heard of. She invited us to a park to 'meet'. When we arrived a makeshift funeral of sorts, consisting of 10 people we had never seen crying over a set of crystals was sprung on us. As it turns out my Father has requested his body be cremated and spread over a park. He wanted no one to know when his funeral was because 'life was full of surprises'. In the middle of said funeral it rained. As I walked to my car, his girlfriend asked me for money to cover his expenses and debt. The entire situation was an absolute disaster."
