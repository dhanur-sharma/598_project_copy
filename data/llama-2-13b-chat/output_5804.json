        "Summarize the following story in first person: the story that I resumed a few months ago was shocking because it was supposed to be a quiet trip, until the thieves got up and shot at the collector. because of that event many things happened in my life, I had post traumatic stress. Among other things I suffered quite the first months because it was the first time they killed someone in cold blood in my presence, it was quite shocking. Already in this moment of my life I see it as a distant memory. With the support of my family I also got ahead. I rarely remember the incident badly. I think they should improve safety at bus terminals, so people can travel quietly. Passenger safety must be guaranteed at all times. Also take more precautions when it comes to being on a bus. I always see who gets on the bus and what they look like. although it is difficult to know for sure who can be a danger. Sometimes I think that luck greatly influences those cases. There are things that we simply cannot control at all. when an event of that magnitude happens, it will simply happen. this is the end of my little summary."
