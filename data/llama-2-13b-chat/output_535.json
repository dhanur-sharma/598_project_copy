        "Summarize the following story in first person: I have recently joined a RCIA training class at my Catholic church to become confirmed Catholic. a few weeks ago during Sunday Mass, I and the other members of my class were introduced to the church congregation. We were given a script of things we were to say during the short ceremony when the priest would do the introductions. He was to also say a prayer for our successfully completing the class. I had been told generally what to expect, but of course, it didn't go perfectly. Everything went well, except I got confused once about where I was supposed to say my little part of the script - but it worked out. I wasn't nervous, but I was deeply moved by this ceremony. It's really one of the things that has drawn me to the Catholic religion-the ceremony and sacredness of every little thing that is done. I love the music. The beauty of the church is striking. Anyway, we finished our little ceremony with few mistakes. We had walked up the steps at the alter to be closer to the priest, who isn't a young man and he's slightly limited in mobility. Turned out he wasn't going to come close to us, and our sponsors were to come around from behind to face us and do part of the blessing that the priest would have done. A bit clumsily, they inched around us and accomplished the task. Then it was over. We returned to our pew in the front and the Mass continued. Quite an experience."
