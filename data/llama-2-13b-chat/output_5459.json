        "Summarize the following story in first person: At least, I assumed it had to be the foxes. What else could it be? I walked around the barn to find if there was any other sign of tampering from those kids that lived at the farm a couple miles down. Every once in a while they'd tamper with something or other playing late at night. It was entirely possible they let some chickens loose or was playing with them. However, when I asked my wife about it, she mentioned the whole family was away on vacation. Her second point, a bit more troubling. That there had been a hunter out here working on the county's fox problem. That no one had reported a fox sighting in at least a few months. The following night, I set up a chair, my father's gun, and a water bowl for Joey to sit outside with me and watch the area where the chickens were kept. If there was anything that could slip by me, guaranteed they wouldn't slip by my pal Joe, the hound. I sat quietly with a glass of bourbon for roughly an hour when the chickens started making a ruckus. Low at first, just sort of pacing around the pen. Shortly after they were flapping, cawing, making all sorts of strange movements. Joe perked up but seemed just as confused as I was. He looked from the pen, to me, back to the pen again, then began barking in the direction of the cornfield. I squinted. There was something in that cornfield. If it wasn't the neighbors kids, and it wasn't the foxes... what was it?"
