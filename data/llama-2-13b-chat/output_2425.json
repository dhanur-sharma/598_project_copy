        "Summarize the following story in first person: My husband hated this guy at the bar. He couldn't stand being near him. It's like there is an issue between them. He took me around the back of the bar and started to kick the trash can. My husband never wanted to start a fight with the dude. We got into an argument. My husband claims that the friend was the one that broke into our house. My husband claims that he seen his dirty little notes in our mailbox and he didn't want to tell me about it because he didn't want to cause a fight. I couldn't resist the feelings. So I screamed at him and asked why he couldn't file a report. My husband said that he didn't want to make me upset. He feels like that my friend is cheating with me.  This all happened 4 weeks ago. I'm kind of over the situation. I feel like I understand my husbands perspective."
