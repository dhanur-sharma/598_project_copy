Even though we had grown apart over the years, i was still fond of her. And i still am. It was a casual visit, as usual. I never realized everything was about to change. I saw the machine beeping, so i attended the voicemail. Professor Dan? I couldn't believe that my mom was seeing him! After everything that happened with Dad? I was furious. I now realize that mom is an adult, she has the freedom to live life she sees as fit. I don't know why i stormed out after telling her to never call me again. Hope she forgives me."
