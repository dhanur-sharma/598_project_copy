        "Summarize the following story in first person: A few weeks ago I went to a concert of my one of my favorite artists. I went with my wife and a coworker and her husband. I didn't know the coworkers that well as we work in different departments. I overheard her talking about liking a similar artist and asked if she was going to the concert. She said that it would be fun and then bought tickets. My wife and I met them near the venue and went to dinner before the show. We had a few drinks and had a good time with them. I was surprised how fun and entertaining my coworker is. She is a little older than my wife and I and I misjudged her based on her appearance. We talked a lot about music and I realized that she knew a lot of music and has very similiar musical tastes as me, which is surprising since I like a lot of lesser known bands. We then walked from dinner over to the concert venue, which was outside. I enjoyed the band a lot. I've seen them several times before so that was expected. I was really excited to have met someone to go to other concerts with. A lot of my friends don't like many of the shows that I want to go to. I was also excited to have a new friend at work."
