        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was in a wreck for the first time. It was a really unexpected event. Given my personal experience, I thought that it was something that only happened on TV or movies, but apparently that's not the case. I've always been so far removed from those things that I didn't even feel as if they existed. It was around 6:00 AM and I was headed to my jiu jitsu class. I was in an Uber going around a small lagoon. I take this route every day, and this area is a rather affluent area that's considered safe. It was quite cold in the morning, and it showed. Generally speaking, people like to exercise around the lagoon. There wasn't a soul there. A man in his 30's was sitting in his car. Then I noticed that his hands were above his head, and there were two men on motorcycles next to him. It was as if he just completely freaked out, because there was a motorcycle on each side of him. He came to a full stop on the middle of the road, and my uber slammed into the back of him. I luckily came out mostly unscathed, I only sprained my wrist. He ended up having  a concussion. Luckily, no one was injured."
