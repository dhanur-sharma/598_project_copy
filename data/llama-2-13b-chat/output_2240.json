        "Summarize the following story in first person: I went to Memphis with my son and fiancee a couple weeks ago.  We rented a new Malibu and took a 7 hour(longer with stops) road trip.   It was a very fun experience.  We spent 3 days in Memphis.  We got to see Beale St, eat barbecue, meet up with old friends and tour the city. The food in Memphis is amazing as well.  We also saw the zoo and went to the Bass pyramid.  The pyramid was very interesting as I am a basketball fan and there is a lot of history in that building. I hadn't been there since I was a small child so it was fun to see the city.  It was an emotional experience for me as it made me realize how much I want to leave Illinois.  I would like to start a new life with my family somewhere new. Memphis, while not ideal, showed me that other areas are a lot more in tune with what I want in life.   Seeing the nightlife, the family activities and places to live showed me the whole picture. It made me sad to have to leave.  This experience has motivated me to get serious about saving money so we can move somewhere in the South.  I think that it will help our family have a better life."
