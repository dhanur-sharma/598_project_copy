        "Summarize the following story in first person: When I was 25 I found out my father had metastatic cancer. I took the diagnosis really hard. I was always so close to my father. My father and I had a special relationship that not many people can say they've had.  When finding out about his diagnosis I was about to start my college courses in New York. I think I was in denial, thinking that there was going to be some time, and medicine that would cure it. I had high hopes that everything was going to be okay. While I was away in New York in college he passed away suddenly. It was really sudden since the diagnosis to the end of his time. I was completely in shock. I wasn't there with him, which I felt terrible for. I know my father didn't want to tell me how serious his condition was. I thought maybe he just wanted me to stay in New York so I dint have to witness him in the condition that he was in. I took time away from college to attend my fathers services, I know that I have to carry on my plan as expected, because that is what he wanted me to do. So as i carry on his name I want to make him proud. My father will always be with me, looking down on my journey in life."
