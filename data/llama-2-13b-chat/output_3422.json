        "Summarize the following story in first person: About one week ago, my husband and I had our 10 year anniversary. He always surprises me with nice gifts on our anniversary so I was eager to see what he got me to celebrate a whole decade together. During dinner, he handed me a cute anniversary card. When I opened it up, I found tickets for my favorite artist. This artist is important to me because my grandfather would always listen to this artist when I was younger, and sing me their songs. The concert was to be held later that night. After dinner, we drove to the concert which was in a small old church. There were less than thirty twenty five people in the audience which made me feel like I had a lot of alone time with my husband. At one point, the artist came from down the stage and started performing right next to my husband and I. The lights switched to us and everybody was watching. My husband and I started slow dancing to the song as everyone watched. Tears began to fall from my eyes during this magical moment. At the end of the song everyone clapped for us. To my surprise, the artist said \"happy ten year anniversary\" to us. I gave my husband a long kiss and everyone clapped again. It was the best night of my life."
