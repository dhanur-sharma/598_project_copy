        "Summarize the following story in first person: Recently, I have connected with my oldest brother whom I have never met. I have always known that I have an older brother from a marriage that my Dad had before my Mother.  I had found my oldest brother on Facebook years ago and tried to reach out to him then. Unfortunately, at that time, he was uninterested in knowing me or my brothers. Recently though, about 3 months ago, my brother reached out to my Mom and let her know that if my brothers or I wanted to contact him, we could. I ended up messaging him on Facebook and have been talking to him ever since. It's strange how very similar we are and how much we look alike as well. This contact with my estranged brother has brought about MANY emotions that I never knew that I had. Our father passed away in 2014 and talking to my brother has in some ways resurfaced my grief. I've also felt joy, happiness and a feeling of connection with him that I never knew that I could. Also, we ended up getting in touch with each other around the five year anniversary of Dads death and that felt like a punch in the gut. It was my Father who chose not to have contact with my brother and in a lot of ways, I feel terrible for him. My dad was amazing to me and my full blooded brothers but for my oldest brother, Dad was never there and now there will never be a chance for him to make amends to him. My oldest brother would never know the joy that my Dad brought to the people around him. My Dad was an amazing man with many flaws, like us all but he was still caring, intelligent, kind and most importantly, he was my Dad. My oldest brother will ONLY ever know him as the man who was never there for him. As for the most memorable part of this event, it has to be the joy that I have felt reconnecting with my brother as well as the grief and pain. In a lot of ways, he and I are so very similar. We like the same kind of music, we play the same games, we have the same type of humor. My full blooded brothers both take a lot more after our Mom but I look so much like my Dad. My oldest brother also does so, we both look similar whereas the brothers that I grew up with, we do not look similar. Moving forward, I look forward to growing closer to my brother and hopefully making up for lost time."
