        "Summarize the following story in first person: My whole life I've felt a pull towards the south and about 3 months ago I was finally given an opportunity to move there with my wife. My job offered me a higher paying position in Texas and my wife had just been laid off her job, so we figured \"Let's do it!\". We were both pretty excited about the move and I knew I could make back the cost of moving with only two or three months of work in Texas. An agent found us a beautiful home, we sent our belongings out ahead by moving truck, and my wife and I packed a few items in a Uhaul to make a road trip out of it. Our spirits were high and it was almost like a fun getaway driving to our new life. We didn't recognize the first signs of trouble, but they were there, literally. As we entered the State, Trump signs began spotting the roadsides with sayings like Build the Wall, Muslims Go Home, Lock Her Up and Trump Will Make Us Great Again. We saw them and didn't think twice about it because we were so happy and focused on enjoying our road trip. The sun was setting as we drove up to our new home and the house looked exactly like it did in the online pics, except for the 6 or 7 signs sprinkled across our new lawn. There were lawn signs that said things like Build The Wall - Make America Safe Again, No Illegals - Lock Them Up, etc. We didn't know whether they were a welcome to the neighborhood gift or a warning to go home. I looked over at my hispanic wife with concern and she began crying. \"We can't live here\" she said. I held her while she cried and then got out of the car and ripped all the signs from our lawn, tossing them over the fence into our new backyard. I wasn't going to let this ruing our plans for the future. We were moving to the south and it would be ok. My wife and I left all our belongings in the car, walked to our front door and went in our new home. As we entered the house I turned and locked the door behind us, it suddenly hit me that I didn't feel safe here. I told my wife she better use the bathroom because we had a long drive home."

I picked it up and looked at it and it was then that I realized the writing on the sign was not just hate speech, it was a threat. I had to get my wife and I out of here. I grabbed our stuff from the car and we left. As we drove away, I looked in the rearview mirror and saw the signs were still on our lawn, but now they were accompanied by a note that read, \"If you don't like it, leave\". I knew I had made the right decision. We would not be living here and I would not let anyone make us feel unwelcome in our own home.\n\n"
