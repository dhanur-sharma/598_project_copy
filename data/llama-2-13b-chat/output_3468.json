        "Summarize the following story in first person: About four months ago, I adopted my daughter. My wife and I had been unable to conceive and the fertility clinics could not help us. So we went to an adoption agency. The first child we saw was Marcy, our little girl. We fell in love with her right away. That day was so hard and amazing at the same time. It just so happened to coincide the the anniversary of the death of my grandfather. I loved my grandfather so much and miss him every day. He had been sick for a few weeks before that. And I had gotten the opportunity to see him before he passed. So the day was bitter sweet. Marcy came home and she was so scared but excited. The whole time, I had a picture of my grandpa in the back of my mind. In time, Marcy will learn about the tragedy that struck our family those many years ago on the same day that she came home to us. She turned that day around for us and we are forever loving to her."
