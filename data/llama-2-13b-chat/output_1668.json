        "Summarize the following story in first person: After the untimely death of father I continued to close accounts and handle issues that arose in the estate. I was ecstatic and very surprised when I received the 12 checks in the mail from the lawyer. The money was enough to pay off bills and the remainder of the mortgage on my parents home. It was bitter sweet that I inherited my family home I grew up in so soon. Nonetheless it was mine now. I went through the home and went over paperwork that was left. I came across the legal paperwork for a case in which my father was awarded money. It was the case in which I received the 12 checks from. As I went through the paperwork I realized the 12 checks were just the tip of the iceberg. There were a list of payments that were to be made to my father and now to me. I was astounded. My parents had been working on this case for years. I gathered the paperwork and went all the way to the lawyer. The lawyer explained that this would be ongoing and I would receive many more payments for years to come. A week later I received 2 more checks."
