        "Summarize the following story in first person: My car was towed.  It was a nasty thing that my landlady did to me.  I was quite upset and it was costly.  It was the first time I ever had a car towed.  Going to the impound yard was certainly a different kind of experience. I had to sue to get my money from the towing reimbursed.  That was quite an experience and cost me more money.  Fortunately, that was also received back by me.  I could have easily lived without the whole experience.  I am lucky that I was in a position of having sufficient resources, mental and monetary, to take care of the matter.  Other people were not so fortunate.  We are hoping to get the landlady dismissed. Actually, it would be more accurate to call her a 'property manager' although she has no license, experience, or talent in managing or property.  Anyway, it was a negative couple of weeks during this time and I was quite unhappy.  All's well that ends well.  That's what is commonly quoted in any event."
