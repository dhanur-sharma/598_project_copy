        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was diagnosed with PTSD young in my life in the last 6 months. It's been a struggle trying to do most things that I should do again, but it also has opened my eyes to what life and reality truly are. I started this process 6 months ago. I've been going through processing therapy with my therapist of course and it's been really tough. It was hard at first. Hard for me to adjust to telling someone my deepest and worst secrets. Whilst it's working though it is really hard to go through. Unfortunately for me after this diagnosis everything started coming back to me. Memories, nightmares, feelings. I've been losing a lot of time because of it. I'm missing out on things I should be in volved in. Dinner parties, birthday parties. I'm missing out. Through therapy I'm learning how to minimize these reoccurring thoughts and try my best to live in a new way than I had before. It's affected my life basically long story short in a very painful and uneasy way. Through the pain there are moments of sunshine which I hold onto as long as I can."
