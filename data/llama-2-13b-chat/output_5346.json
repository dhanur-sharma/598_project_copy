        "Summarize the following story in first person: About four months ago my mother became disabled. Being that I don't get along with my family, I wasn't looking forward to visiting but I knew I should. What was surprising to me was that really I didn't end up having a bad experience as usual. Instead, my family treated me okay. They we're not dismissive, and didn't go out of their way to belittle me. Instead the focus was on mom, and that way it felt more calm and easy to be around them. The good thing about it was that we were even laughing together. Mom showed interest in what I had to say. I was able to share how things were progressing in my life and what I was aspiring to. I agreed to come around more often. I actually think I will visit again next week if i can. I hope I can repair relations with my family. I think we would all be happier. I think we would even appreciate each other more. But I guess I can see about that."
