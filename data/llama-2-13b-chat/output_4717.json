        "Summarize the following story in first person: I've been working at the hospital in my city now for about 2 years. I got hired right out of med school on to the surgical staff, which has been my dream job ever since I saw Scrubs back in high school. I was elated to find out I would be following in Turk's shoes. The first year going great for me. I had a lot of big surgeries, no major mishaps, a few positive reviews from my boss and the board; I was flying high and I loved my job. It was like this up until about 11 months ago. My former boss had retired, and hospital hired someone from the outside to come in and fill his position. Everything changed with this new boss. Pretty much no matter what I did was wrong in his eyes. I was no long put on the team during big surgeries and he never gave me a reason why. There was some gossip going around that he just didn't like me. He felt threatened by my abilities so he didn't want to give me a chance to shine above him. At first I couldn't believe it, but then I started to really think about it. With this in mind, I started observing his actions with this new knowledge. Surely enough, I started to get that impression too. My boss did not like me and it was holding me back in my career. I have just grinned and bared it for the past 11 months, but it may be a time for a change."
