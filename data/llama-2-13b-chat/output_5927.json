        "Summarize the following story in first person: At the beginning of this summer, I visited the man I'd known as my stepfather for most of my life. He and my mother got married when I was two years old, and were together until my sophomore year of college. It was a messy divorce that spanned continents. It took place during one of his final deployments in Afghanistan and he filed against my mother through fax. Understandably, it took me a long time to forgive him. I first reached out again when I discovered I was pregnant. He came to visit me and my son, before his first birthday. I saw him again four years later on the day before my wedding. He'd been married again himself and had two small daughters, but his wife couldn't make it as she was tending to the newborn. I'd still never met her. Did I mention she was less than eight years older than me? So in May, we accepted the offer to visit their home in Florida. I was filled with feelings of fear and reservations of entering this home built between my father and the woman that took my mother's place beside him. I was also bringing my son and husband, so it would be a packed house with little acquaintance. Somehow, it was fun! The angst and worry that I'd felt as a late teen was overshadowed by the openness and respect of the entire event. At no point were we made to feel uncomfortable and it was truly nice seeing him function as an active and present father, something he was not able to do for me because of the military. I cried the morning we left, hard. I had no clue how much I'd missed my Dad."
