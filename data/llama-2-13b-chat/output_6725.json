        "Summarize the following story in first person: Another of my little birds have left the nest. My trainee has finally left our store and gone on to her new assignment. I helped her clean out her desk on her last day. She left me one of her plants and I put it on my desk. It was nice to see her go I will miss her and the crazy times we had getting her training done under the pressure of the daily grind. I feel though she is ready to take on all comers and fill her role sucessfully.  It is so hard to balance my schedule and duties and train someone that I am a little relieved and yet sad. I dont usually feel that way, I generally wish my trainees well and move on.  I feel I really helped her and made a difference for our company to succeed having trained people step up. I don't know who I will mentor next but I hope they are as smart and nice as she was. It was worth the extra effort as she appreciated it and really what more can you ask of someone. I am worn out though and will enjoy the break. Now I can focus on my tasks that have fallen a bit behind. Maybe I will start a new project. We have made a date though for coffee (starbucks) in a few weeks so I can touch base with her and ensure all is going well.  I think though she will be fine and will hit the ground rolling. I hope all my training pays off."
