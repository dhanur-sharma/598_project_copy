        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last week at work I was finally given the promotion that I have been working so hard to get for a long time now. I had been trying to prove myself as an good employee and a great asset to the team for a little over a year now, but my manager would always tell me that a promotion just isn't in the budget, to keep trying. There were certainly times I felt like giving up and that I was never going to get the raise, and I had even started looking for a new job. What I was making just was not enough money for me to live my life the way I wanted to live it. Well, a few months ago, my supervisor and only other person on my team broke his pelvis. Since the injury was so severe, he has been out of the office for going on three months now, leaving me alone to do ALL of the work we were once both responsible for. The circumstances were horrible for him, but it was my time to shine and prove myself to my boss. I took on extra tasks, regularly stay late, and am a bigger part of meetings my supervisor used to run. Because of how willing to do extra work I was, people started to take notice and none of our regular processes had any interruptions. My boss and other colleagues began to take notice of how I was working. I was receiving a lot of praise, and it felt good, but it was just that. It was all just praise, nothing material came of it. Well, last week I was called into a meeting with my manager and my director to discuss all of the work I had been doing. In this meeting, they discussed with me a promotion they were going to give me and allowed me to negotiate a higher pay as a thanks for all of my hard work. They had realized how instrumental I was to the team and wanted to keep me happy working here. I was ecstatic. I had finally gotten the recognition I had deserved and had finally gotten the raise I had worked so hard for. Life is good. I now hold so much more pride in my work and I think my future performance will reflect that."
