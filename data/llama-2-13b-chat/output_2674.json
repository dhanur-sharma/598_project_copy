        "Summarize the following story in first person: My boyfriend had been in prison for a year and it was estimated that he would be coming home on August 1.  However, we didn't know if that was really going to happen because we were having some issues with his parole and where he was being released to.  If a prisoner doesn't have an address to be paroled to then they will remain in prison until they have a safe place to go home to.  So even though I was really looking forward to August coming, part of me didn't think it was going to happen and I wasn't going to see him.  Well, due to some changes with his parole release, I called his counselor to get the address sorted out and while I was speaking to her I asked her when he was due to be released.  She said that regardless of whether he was being released to the shelter or to his parents' house, he was coming home August 1st.  It was a bit of a shock to hear that and it made it very \"real\" to know that I actually was going to see him.  I went from being very relaxed about the whole thing to suddenly being very stressed out.  Even though I was excited, it's still a strange feeling to see someone that you haven't seen in so long.  We have kids and a life together and for him to leave and miss huge parts of that and then just come back is a really weird, uncomfortable feeling.  I've only heard the sound of his voice since July of 2018 so he almost feels like a stranger to me.  So now things are very serious and the date is quickly approaching.  There are lots of things to get ready, sending his clothes to him for release and making sure he has a ride to get home.  And of course, trying my best to prepare two toddlers to see their father again.  I don't know if they will recognize him, but it is happening, and happening soon.  I guess ready or not, we're going to see him again."
