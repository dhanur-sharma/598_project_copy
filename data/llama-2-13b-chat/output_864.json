        "Summarize the following story in first person: My grandmother passed away only three months ago. It feels like yesterday because her passing was so painful for me. She was suffering so much, and I felt guilty feeling like her passing was a relief at the time. While her passing away was a relief because she wasn't suffering anymore, I feel totally lost and lonely without her. I viewed my grandma as my mom because she raised me from the time that I was born. I feel so alone now. My own mother couldn't handle motherhood, so my grandma filled that role for me. Actually saying she filled that role is a huge understatement. She devoted herself (emotionally and time) entirely to me. I have memories of her when I was young coming to all of my school events, and cheering me on at sports events. She talked me through hard times with friends and boyfriends as I got older. She also encouraged me to work hard in school which I did. Due to her encouragement, I got into college and she paid for everything. I did really well in college, and immediately got a job I love right after graduation. I feel really sad because I am not married yet, and always dreamed that she would meet my future husband and children. I am still in shock that she died so quickly because I always viewed her as a healthy person. She went to all of her physicals, and it seemed like her cancer came out of nowhere. I have no idea how her cancer wasn't caught through routine blood work that she had at  her last physical. I feel angry, but those feelings of anger are now being replaced by feelings of sadness."
