        "Summarize the following story in first person: While we were there, we visited the big, \"touristy\" sites like Old Faithful and the mineral springs and hot springs.  Old faithful did not disappoint.  It was awesome.  During the nights at camp, you could hear some of the newly re-introduced wolves off in the distance.  Some of the group was nervous that they would visit during the night.  I was more concerned with the black bear and most especially the grizzlies.  Both are notorious for letting their noses get them in trouble.  They can smell the food and stick their heads right into tents!  We were sure to put our food in the bear-proof containers provided at the campsite.  But we actually saw some grizzlies visiting the stream when we were fishing.  The salmon were running and the grizzlies rely on these fish to fatten up in order to survive the on-coming winter.  There were several females with cubs who were stationed along the waterfall, catching the salmon that were jumping.  They would pull off some of the skin and nudge it towards the cubs.  They seemed to waste a lot of the fish as they were eating the eggs, the skin and the heads.  I guess they were more interested in the high-calorie parts, which makes sense, considering that they are trying to fatten up.  One bear got too close as one of us was reeling in a fish and the bear decided it was her's.  But the biggest thrill/scare came when a male arrived on the scene.  He seemed to be twice the size of the rest and was a bit of a bully.  But if he got too close to any of the cubs, the brave mom's would confront the massive bear.  I wouldn't want any of those things sticking their heads into my tent in the middle of the night!"
