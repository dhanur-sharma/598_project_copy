It was such a trauma, i was shivering at the thought of it all this time. 6 months back, on that dreadful morning, i was heading to work. Quite the normal day, it seemed. I was about to be proven so wrong. Right after we crossed the turning around the bank, we heard screams. And gun shots. I suppose the bus driver was taken aback by the hassle. Why would he stop then? I do not know. Three masked men stormed out of the bank, shooting in every which way. I immediately ducked down. I don't really know what happened. As the cops got there and helped us out, i saw the driver lying down. He was shot, and gone."
