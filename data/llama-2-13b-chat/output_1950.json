        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was about 5 months ago when I first got sick with my first cold of the season. I ended missing 2 days of work due to not feeling up to interacting with people. I remember thinking what a waste of my vacation days since I could not even do anything fun with my time off. Even though he wasn't home with me during the days I missed, my significant other played a key role in me getting better. He came right home after work and did not go out with friends or run any errands. He must have sensed my surprise since I kept asking him why he was so attentive. I was not expecting a response from him, but was surprised when he responded. He admitted to me that he felt a need to be more attentive and decided it was best if he was home to take care of me. It was a nice surprise to hear and made me feel even more at ease knowing he was doing it because he wanted to and not because he felt forced. The best part of the whole thing is when he made me soup and dinner. It was nice being taken care of for once and not being depended on to do everything. I think he also understood it as well. He commented to me afterward how much work it is to take care of others and how time consuming it can be. If anything I think it made him appreciate me more and also appreciate how being in a relationship is a two way road. Though it would have been nicer being taken care of on a normal day without being sick, I will take what I can get. If being sick was the catalyst for things getting better between me and him, then I am ok with that."
