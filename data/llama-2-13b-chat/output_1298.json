        "Summarize the following story in first person: After a lot of work on myself through therapy, journaling, self-help books, etc, I realized that I don't have to be ashamed of who I am or constantly apologize for myself. There isn't anything wrong with me. I spent a lot of my life feeling like there was something inherently wrong with me as a person, something deep seeded that made me unlovable and of little value. That's how I internalized things that I experienced as a child at the hands of my parents. I didn't think it could be them; they're my parents and are faultless. That's not true though. They're people just like I am who had children and made a lot of mistakes. It felt really good to put a good chunk of that load down and begin to just let myself be. I can have compassion and understanding for myself now, I can make mistakes and be okay with it because I'm a human just like everyone else. I'm entitled to go through life and stumble sometimes and take responsibility for it. It feels like a weight has been lifted. I still get upset when I can't do things well, I still want to do everything perfectly out of habit, but I can remind myself that I'm just a person and I'm not perfect and that's okay. Everything is okay, even when it's not. That's just how life and people are. It's freeing."
