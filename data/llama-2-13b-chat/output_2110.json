        "Summarize the following story in first person: I threw my first punch at someone since playing Power Rangers in pre-school. The Egg-shaped fuck had it coming, being a 30-year-old staying in a hostel and inviting himself to an evening in the town with a group of us. He proceeded to divulge how he always gets charged more than the initial agreed upon price for prostitutes and how he came to Vietnam to eat dog in a legal and fine-dining setting; I punched him and left after he mentioned the latter, going as so far to ride back to the hostel, check-out at 10 pm and find a beachfront hotel for the night to get some solace. I carved a bong out of an apple once there, imbibing in a beer as well to numb my hand off a bit as it was sore as fuck. I expected his pudgy face to be more giving, but my knuckles seem to have connected with his jaw. I truly have no idea of what ensued as I wasn\u2019t plussed by the group of people anyway\u2026there\u2019s truly something about this part of the world that attracts low-esteemed wanderers, keen on nothing but smokes and the idea they are \u2018far from home\u2019. The most depressing, and least interesting, are the majority of gringos here, who stick to the major cities only and transport themselves around the country using buses, too afraid to ride a gas-horse into the arguably authentic corners of this beautiful country. Rural villages with a single hotel that lacks airconditioning, with the only \u201cattraction\u201d being a monument to communism doesn\u2019t make for an instagramable trip to these types. A shame, but as is expected in this day and age, where being an influencer en masse or in their social circles is the calling card for so many yuppies out here. An example: today while traveling from Da Nang to Hue I went through a coastal mountain pass with 13% inclines at points, roads that give even the non-shit bikes trouble. The apex has a crumbling outpost from some war that apparently happened here not too long ago\u2026an interesting sight as you can see both cities even though they are quite distant\u2026probably why the pillboxes were constructed in the first place. I stumbled gracefully down back to my bike with its black seat sweltering in the heat, just waiting to melt my balls off during my descent. As I struggled to put on my helmet-earphone-sunglasses combo I noticed a familiar sight pull up: white girls being driven by locals. Their accents led me to believe they were from California, with my suspicions confirmed by noticing that one was only pretending to be blonde for conformity; roots tell no lies. I watched as they had the men park the bikes in a vista-worthy spot, angling the bikes sideways upon the head-chieftains aesthetic demands. I had seen advertisements for services which you can pay for to have a rider take you, at a pace of your choosing from the north to the south, or vice versa, for a daily rate (in less expensive lodging of course) but the look on their faces convinced me the rate they had agreed upon was seeming lower than the journeys worth."

I turned my bike around and sped off, feeling the wind pick up as I descended further. I would make it to Hue that day, but they would have to wait for another day to be led around by the hand like they were lost in a department store. A small victory, but a victory nonetheless. I was surprised to find out later that they had made it to Hue as well, albeit hours later than I had. The power of being a capable individual was evident in the fact that I had arrived with ease, while they had to endure the grueling journey. This is the story of my first punch in Vietnam, a story that will forever be etched in my memory as the time I put a man in his place for his lack of self-awareness."
