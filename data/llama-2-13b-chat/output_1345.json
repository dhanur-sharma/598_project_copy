        "Summarize the following story in first person: Three months ago me and Kreig stopped being best friends. It was a sad day for me.  I look back on it and I could see it happening. We were best friends in high school and grew apart a little in college but still remained close. Then life happened. we both got full time jobs in different cities and that life thing kicked in. You know that part of being best friends is shared experiences and being able to remember them, talk about them and laugh. We had some great times when we were younger and hung out all the time, games, concerts ( the fight at ZZ top), and hunting. But, time moves on and people grow apart with distance, time,  and meeting other people. I know that is what happened to us. I feel really sad this happened because he was my best friend for almost 15 years. That being said, I know that we will keep in contact but it just wont be the same as it use to be. That makes me sad because Kreig was in my life for so long. I hope one day that we both can build a relationship as strong with someone else and be able to have those shared memories and laughs. I think that is important for people to have best friends and they don't come around often."
