        "Summarize the following story in first person: At the age of 11, I was diagnosed with a chronic disease called Type 1 Diabetes.  Type 1 Diabetes is when the autoimmune system attacks the pancreas and destroys the pancreas' ability to regulate blood sugar.  Due to this, a Type 1 Diabetic has to inject insulin everyday in order to live.  Unfortunately, while you can do a good job managing your blood sugars using insulin, you simply can't compare to a fully functioning pancreas and problems will occur as a result.  In May, I was at home on a Saturday cooking dinner.  I was having brown rice and baked chicken breasts.   Due to the carbohydrates that are in rice, I had to take insulin in order for my body to process the brown rice.  I took my insulin around 20 minutes before I ate.   I planned to eat a lot(for me) of brown rice that evening so I took a much larger than normal dose of insulin.  After I prepared my food, I sat down and began to eat my chicken breasts first.  I tried a special barbecue sauce on the chicken breasts and they tasted wonderful.   I had no problems devouring the chicken breasts.  After I finished the chicken breast, I started to eat the brown rice.  However, I started to feel extremely and uncomfortably full to the point where I became nauseated.   Unfortunately, at that time the insulin that I took for the brown rice started to kick in some my blood sugar dropped down to dangerously low levels.  I tried to eat the rice to get my blood sugar back up, but I was so full that I couldn't do it.  At that time, the effects of low blood sugar were kicking in.  I was sweating heavily and shaking.  I had trouble moving.  My ability to think and problem solve took a huge hit.  I was slowly wandering around my apartment looking for something that I could eat that wouldn't cause me to vomit which would make it even harder to get my blood sugar back up.  That's when I found some Powerbar Energy Gels that I use when I exercise.  They weren't heavy on your stomach and they have a lot of carbohydrates which would counteract the insulin.  I downed a few packets of the gels and in 20-25 minutes I started to feel better.  I had survived, but it is a situation that still scares me to this day."
