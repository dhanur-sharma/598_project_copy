I don't date a lot, not because I don't want to but because I just never seem to find someone. Finally I met someone. She is and was everything that I was looking for. Interesting and fun and someone I can talk to for hours. I told her some things that had happened to me in the past, stuff I just don't tell anyone. This was over the messaging program discord and she stopped me. She was quiet for a moment and I was worried I did something wrong. After a while she started talking. Telling me something that was horrific that happened to her when she was younger. I had no idea this had happened, she never even brought it up slightly to me before. I listened while she talked and I wanted to cry. Not for me but for her and that she had been holding on to something for so long. I wish we lived closer so I could properly comfort her, but instead I thanked her for telling me about it. It made me realize how close we actually were. I could trust her and she could trust me."
