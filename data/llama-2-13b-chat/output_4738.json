        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last year's Christmas holiday was a really memorable one. We had all family members come back home last month. One on the major reason for the reunion was for the family to bond. My wife and I thought it was a really good idea, so we brought the kids along. It was a really fun filled holiday. The highpoint of the holiday was when I enrolled my children in the community's annual fishing contest. We had quite some time to teach them how to fish in a local lake. My brother who happens to be a good fisherman did his absolute best to make sure my kids were fully ready for the contest. It was quite exciting as my two older kids caught their first fish before the contest. This activity really helped the bonding process. Although my kids didn't win the contest but we all had a good time. After the contest, we continued the celebration at home. My wife and I prepared the fish my kids caught. It was really fun. The holiday all of the sudden seemed to be too short and it was all over. My kids and I are looking forward to our next visit and fishing contest."
