        "Summarize the following story in first person: I had to homeschool my two girls because the private school they were attending closed. Public school, with its liberal brain-washing, is out of the question for us. I looked for other private schools, and prices were way too high for us. So the only option left was to homeschool. Which I dreaded. I had dreaded it even before any of my kids were born. I am NOT a teacher, I have neither talent nor patience for it. So before I even had kids, the thought was playing in my mind, \"What if we can't afford private education and I HAVE TO homeschool?\" And sure enough, it did happen. After 3 good years of having my kids at that nice little school, it closed. I signed up with a homeschooling site and purchased materials. I studied them, prepared for the school year, and for the whole year, I persevered, doing it the best I could. I am sorry to say I did hate it. Sure, there were pleasant moments, but overall... not my thing. We made it to summer break. I was preparing myself to the idea of having to do another year, when I letter came from the girls' old school, telling us they reopened!! Do I need to say I was in heaven?"
