        "Summarize the following story in first person: A few weeks ago I was driving down to visit my parents for the holidays. They live a couple hours away and I was leaving on a Friday night after getting off from work. I had the following week off for Christmas and planned to stay with my family. When I left from work that night, it was almost 8 p.m. and was already dark. My parents live in a secluded area which is pretty dark with a lot of forest around them. It's very beautiful during the day, but reminds me of something out of a horror movie at night. I had my high beams on most of the way since there aren't many cars on the road out there, especially late at night. And since the roads aren't very well lit the high beams help. I was also pretty tired since I left work late that night and wanted to be extra safe. Unfortunately it wasn't safe enough as I hit a deer that night and ran into a ditch. I'm not sure where the deer came from, well actually it probably came from the forests surrounding the roadway. But I never saw it coming. I hit the deer straight on and it smashed my windshield before I flew into the ditch. I remember seeing blood on my windshield before I ran into the ditch, I thought it was mine for the split second that I was still in control of my car. My car was totaled, but I was okay. I had some bruises and was in some pain, but didn't break anything. Fortunately all of this happened not too far from my parent's home so I called them and they were able to call the police and come with them pretty quickly. Since the accident, and my near death experience, I've had a different outlook on life. I've made a career change and I've decided to move closer to my family. Not because I'm afraid of driving long distances at night, but because I've realized life is too short and I want to spend it with my family and doing something I love. I don't want to be stuck in a dead end job for the next 30 years until I retire. I'm planning to go into business for myself, but I'm not quite sure what I'm going to do yet."
