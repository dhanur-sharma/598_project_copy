        "Summarize the following story in first person: So we go to doctor appointments about four to five times a year. We have to drive down the hill for them, about 1 hour from home each way. We always try to make a day of it, but usually we just go window shopping. I drive because my dad is mentally disabled. This was mid May and my dad's birthday is the beginning of June, so this was my widow of opportunity to surprise him. He was just expecting us to go home, but I drove around a bit, went out of my way, cruised the mall, passed it, then watched his face light up as he knew we were going to his absolute favorite restaurant. Vince's Spaghetti is an hour from our house, so we only go like once a year maybe, but not every year. This time it'd been about 7 years in-between visits. We had the best early dinner, and we always order an extra gallon of sauce to take home with us to sustain the long visits. The bill was almost $100 with tip and I'd never paid for a dinner before. I paid this time, and it was just so nice. That level of finally giving back financially, it's a good feeling. Like that baton has finally been passed. He almost teared up over it, and he's not a crier. Normally this shouldn't have been that special, but just the spur of the moment thing and the bill pay made it special."
