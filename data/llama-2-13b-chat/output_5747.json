        "Summarize the following story in first person: I met Emily three years ago on spring break. We happened to be on the same boat for a Niagara Falls tour and she had forgotten to bring a poncho.  I was standing beside her when the mist started hitting us and she was shivering. I offered her my poncho and we started talking.  It turned out that we were both students at NYU.  She was a freshman with her eyes on law school and I was getting ready to graduate with a business degree and begin working towards my MBA. Back at school, our lives were busy, but we made time to see each other, even if it meant just sitting together to study in the library.  As we got to know each other, I realized that Emily was someone I wanted to be with forever.  After completing my master's, I was able to start saving for a ring.  Six weeks ago, exactly 3 years after we met, I suggested that we make a trip back to Niagara Falls. I placed the ring in the pocket of her yellow poncho.  When she put the poncho on, she pulled out the box and I got to one knee.  I was worried for a moment as she gazed at me without saying anything, a thoughtful look in her eyes.  She seemed to snap out of her trance and said yes.  Everyone on the boat clapped and we got many congratulations as we exited after the tour. I was still concerned about her hesitancy, though. I thought we were perfectly happy and I was confident she wanted to marry me. I asked her a few days later if everything was ok. I noticed that she would occasionally glance at the ring on her finger with a sort of sad look in her eyes.  She said that she was concerned about law school. She had applied to a few schools, some which were several hours drive away. She wanted to marry me, but was afraid that being so far apart for that long would be difficult and that our relationship might suffer.  She was torn between possibly pursuing a different career so that we could go ahead and marry or having to wait through three difficult years apart. Then yesterday, Emily got what she was hoping for -- what we were both hoping for -- her acceptance letter to NYU's law school! It was such a relief to know that we could be together while she completed her law degree."
