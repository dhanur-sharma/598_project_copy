        "Summarize the following story in first person: Two months ago my husband and I were a part of our best friend's wedding. Their ceremony was in a beautiful cathedral with high vaulted ceilings and stunning stained glass windows. Their reception was right down the road at the local wildlife park. They had fairy lights strung up through the canopy of trees over the dining tables. A little dance floor was set up where the DJ was playing exciting music as the guests ate. My husband and I sat with each other having a few cocktails, enjoying the ambiance of the evening. We danced a little, ate a little, and enjoyed time with our lovely friends. My absolute favorite part of the evening was when my adoring husband took me off to the side of the gathering where it was a little quiet. He took me into his arms and we danced under the stars. He whispered how much he loved me and how happy every moment spent with me made him. On our friend's special day this amazing man still made me feel like the bell of the ball. We kissed under the night sky with the faint echo of music and laughter in the background. Eventually our little escapade into the trees had to end. The rest of the evening went off without a hitch. There was much laughter and my sister caught the bouquet! It looks like she will be the next lucky lady. I will always remember that little moment we had together; it made me realize truly how lucky I am to have this amazing man in my life."
