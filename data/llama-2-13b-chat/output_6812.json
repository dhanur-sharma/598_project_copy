        "Summarize the following story in first person: My birthday is August 6th and this is the most memorable day to me.  I woke up that morning to check my facebook and was able to see all the wonderful people that told me Happy Birthday this year.  Oh and by the way, my husband forgot my birthday!  After all I am 35 and as you get older the less people celebrate you on your birthday and the more you hate celebrating because it means you are getting older.  So, back to the rest of the day, I sat there alone all day and then got a call from my best friend Callie Jane.  She told me she was thinking about me but had also forgot the exact day of my birthday.  I understood as I have trouble remembering as well these days too.  I told her it was actually today and that we would be celebrating my birthday at Oscar's it is a local bar and grill.  She told me that she would definitely make it.  Well two hours later I get a call from my husband as he is getting off work at this time.  It was around 3 that afternoon.  He tells me that he is sorry that he forgot my birthday and that he had talked to my best friend Callie Jane as well.  He told me that she wanted to throw a party for me at her place and asked what kind of cake I wanted.  I said that was okay, and that I wanted a cheesecake because I do not like regular cake.  So the plans were set, I was going to her house for my birthday.  She called me later that evening and told me that we would have a fish fry and cake.  I think I was 21 the last time it happened.  I also love fish and knew she was getting me a cheesecake.  So anyways, fast forward to the day of my party.  We get there and she has balloons and it is all decorated just for me.  Her and her friend Cara, that I recently met, put the whole party together.  But wait, that is not it, they also had me a gift.  It was a munchie basket.  I also got a homemade necklace from Cara which I love.  So, the night was wonderful we had drinks and mingled with a bunch of people."
