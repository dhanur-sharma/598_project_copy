        "Summarize the following story in first person: My girlfriend and I recently went to her sister's house for a family gathering for the first time. A lot of the people there did not openly greet me when we arrived. Despite this, I went to each individual and introduced myself. Throughout our visit, I couldn't help but notice people giving me mean and disapproving looks. I still tried to interact with everyone and actively participate in everything. When we had group discussions, people always disagreed with every single thing that I mentioned. My girlfriend and I asked her sister to take some pictures of us with my phone. I looked at the pictures afterwards. All of the pictures she took were very bad pictures. My head was cut off in a most of them. As we were leaving, most of the people did not even make an attempt to say goodbye to me. This was my first time meeting them and I had never done anything to upset or offend anyone. I did everything I could to positively engage these people. It seemed as though no one was happy to meet me. This left me feeling very uninvited and little upset. As a result of this, I decided never to attend any more of their family's social gatherings."
