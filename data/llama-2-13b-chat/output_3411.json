        "Summarize the following story in first person: My daughter is 19 months old and is just learning to talk right now. We snuggle and share affection together frequently. We open our arms wide when we hug and we say \"no thank you\" instead of \"no\" in our household to promote politeness and to soften the negativity you can feel with a basic no. Last week, I opened my arms wide and asked her for a hug. She gave me a coy smile and said, \"no thank you!\" and ran away. My heart simultaneously burst with pride for her understanding of body consent and broke because she rejected my affection. I could tell she really understood how telling me no would make me feel and she enjoyed having some power in our dynamic. This was also the first time she had ever said \"no thank you!\" at all. She is so smart! I am so happy she feels safe to tell me no to touching her person and the physical affection we share will be more special than ever because it's going to me made up of touch we both want to give and consent to. This was a milestone I wasn't expecting and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since it happened. I've told the story to every important person in my life. I am just so proud of my baby girl and I can't wait to see whats next in life for her. Parenting has been such a wild ride- so bittersweet! And also so full of surprises but I love watching my children grow and imagining the women they will be someday."
