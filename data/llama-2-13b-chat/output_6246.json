        "Summarize the following story in first person: August 26, 2019Dear Diary,          Two months ago last night I was at a club downtown.  The sexdolls were in town putting on a show at the local arena.  I was at the bar ordering a drink when this guy came up to me and started talking.  He was asking how i liked being in a band and did i like the city?  I soon realized that he thought I was a member of the sexdolls band.  I was really flattered but I tried to tell him I was not a member of the band but he wouldn't believe me,  He just kept winking at me saying he wouldn't tell anyone who I was.  I tried several more times to convince him that I was not a member of the sexdolls but to no avail.  I decided to just go with it and spent the rest of the night talking with him.  He asked for a picture so I took a selfie with him.  After I had left the bar I giggled all the way home wondering if and when he would figure out that I was not a member of the sexdolls group.  That's something I'll probably never forget getting mistaken for a member of such a popular band.  The next day I was telling my friends about what had happened.  They told me next time the sexdolls were in town that I should dress like they do and see if anyone mistakes me for one again.  I told them that would be hilarious.  I just might try it."
