        "Summarize the following story in first person: So it's my parents 35th anniversary, and they are getting up in their ages. They are quite old now, and I thought that it would be nice if I did something nice for them. So I decided to buy them tickets to their dream vacation place. They were so happy when I handed the tickets to them, that they actually cried. I can't believe that they cried, so I tried to calm them down. They thanked me profusely for the tickets, and I was glad that I brought the tickets for them. I mean after all their hard work in raising me I thought that it would be nice if I return the favor. And so I did. That's why I brought them the tickets. They had a lot of fun over the vacation, and they sent me many pictures! It was great! I enjoyed it as much as they did, vicariously. I'm glad I brought them those tickets. It was the best thing I could've done. And not something I would regret. It was money well spent."
