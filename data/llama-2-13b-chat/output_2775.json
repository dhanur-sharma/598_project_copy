        "Summarize the following story in first person: It has been three years of fighting almost everyday with my husband over unimportant stiff, if we are not fighting about the children, then it is about food or just about his clothes that were not cleaned and ironed as required. I was unhappy and dissatisfied our sex life was non existence, there was no intimacy and the love we once had had turned into hatred.  \" why don't you walk away?\" this is a question I got asked frequently by whoever knew what I was going through. I had considered this option several times but changed my mind because of the children. you see I have four daughter, the oldest being eleven years old and the youngest six. these children love their father very much. whenever he is a way for sometime, they miss him very much and frequently call. so I hang in there for the children. so it happens exactly four weeks today, my husband came home very tired, I had also been working the whole day and I was quite tired. I was in the kitchen cooking, so he came in and after saying hello, he said that he could take it from there and that I should go and put my feet up for a few minutes. for a moment I felt loved, I went off happily. no sooner had I laid my head down than i heard a message come in through his phone. I was curious. I decided to read the message. what I found left me in shock. my husband was seeing another woman, he even had a child with this woman. This caught me off guard. I was disappointed and annoyed. he could not deny it. so I just ended the relationship and decided to ask for a divorce."
