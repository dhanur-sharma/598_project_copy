        "Summarize the following story in first person: It has always been a family tradition for my parents to host me at their home for Thanksgiving. However last year I did not receive their invitation. I suspect it is because my mother found out that I had decided to quit college to pursue my passion. Since I was lonely, I decided to hang out with friends instead. Mary hosted me in her apartment. She prepared a nice meal and opened a bottle of wine. After a few glasses, I opened up to her about my anxiety. I told her about how I was finding it hard to conform and meet my parents expectations of me.  I found myself breaking down as I explained my problem. She is a very good listener. She was able to offer me advice and comfort. In the evening, she ordered a ride home for me. She even called to check on me when arrived.  In the end, I was glad to have a voided my judgmental parents. The time spent with Mary was meaningful to me.  I forged a strong relationship with Mary."
