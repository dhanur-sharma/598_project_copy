        "Summarize the following story in first person: I recently had surgery to have my gallbladder removed.  It happened in a few months ago.  I had been feeling awful for a few weeks prior and decided it was time to have it removed.  I had had several attacks over the past few years prior to this.  I had been to the hospital a couple times for it as well. I went into the hospital to meet the doctor and talk about what was going to be done.  He told me about the whole surgery and what would happen.  I scheduled it for the next week and had to eat basically no fat foods until it was over.  I went in on the day of the surgery and checked in.  They hooked me up and I had to wait an hour or so.  I was put to sleep with the anesthesia and woke up a while later.  I was in pretty massive pain and it was hard for me to sit up. I went home and had to spend the next 10 or so days just laying in bed recovering.  I had a fair amount of pain medication.  I had to have help sitting up and standing and just going to the bathroom.  After about a week I could finally get out of bed by myself.  Now that I've recovered I still have several scars and such but I can eat normally again and I can have fatty foods without feeling totally awful."
