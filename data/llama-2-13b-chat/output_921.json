        "Summarize the following story in first person: Graduating is always going to be one of the most memorable experiences of my life. For me, this would be my 3rd graduation I'd experience, and the one that was most important to me of all: my college graduation. I'd finally done it. I've earned enough credits to get my bachelor's degree in the field of economic marketing. I couldn't be more proud. On the day it happened, almost my whole family happened to show up. They were so incredibly proud of me, probably more than I was even proud of myself. I knew that they were so happy for me because of all the wonderful amazing compliments that I got that day. I got praise from mom, dad, grandpa, cousins, aunts, uncles, you name it, and they were proud. I was the first in my family to graduate college. Nobody else had yet accomplished what I just did. We all went out to a fancy restaurant after. It was such an incredible experience. I will always remember looking back on this day so fondly. I love my family, and can't wait to get a good job offer."
