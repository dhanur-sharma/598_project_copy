        "Summarize the following story in first person: As it's mentioned here in the HIT window, the diary entry that I initially submitted was about a bear that ran out in front of my car as I was coming home from the grocery store one morning. That happened several months ago, probably close to six or seven months have gone by now. I have not really thought about the writing exercise since I completed the survey. Since we've gone through the end of summer and fall is in full-swing here in my neck of the woods, I've been seeing more and more wildlife hanging around. There have been a lot of deer, especially. Of course, seeing a doe run out in front of one's car is a much more common experience for most people. I have thought about the bear, though, anytime that I've slammed on the brakes to avoid hitting the deer. I thought that maybe Animal Control had been called and the bear had been moved out of the area... until recently. I have an update to share: the bear (or what I believe to be the same bear) actually showed up in our neighborhood again! It happened not too long ago - within the last month, maybe month and a half. He/she was traipsing through the back lots behind several houses on our road. This time, the sighting didn't happen on a trash collection day (the two previous times that I saw the bear, garbage had been set out on the curb for pick up). Another key difference was that it was walking through during the evening instead of the morning hours. Several other people also saw the bear, according to neighborhood gossip. It hasn't run out in front of my car again, though (and for that I am grateful!)."

I've also been thinking about how different this area was before all the development that has taken place over the past 20 years or so. I'm sure that the bear was drawn to the area because of the abundance of food and shelter that the neighborhoods and nearby businesses provide. Anyway, that's my update on the bear. I'm sure that it will continue to be a topic of conversation in our neighborhood for some time to come!"
