        "Summarize the following story in first person: Approximately, 3 weeks ago I had an abortion. I was approximately 10 weeks pregnant at the time of the abortion. I had to wake up early on a Saturday morning, miss work and sit alone in an abortion clinic for hours. I felt sad, confused, upset and hurt by this experience. The father of the child was not there for support,  making the situation that much harder. I was given a pill in office and a set of 4 pills to take home with me and take the next day. I left the office that day and went home to the 6 beautiful children that I already have. While upsetting, I was content and confident in my decision. The next day around 3 PM, I took the second set of pills. At this point the physical pain began and lasted several hours. Luckily, I had my amazing best friends there to comfort me. Now, 3 weeks later I am trying to move past this situation. I am also trying to be more careful in making sure I am not put in this situation again. Most importantly, I am focusing on my children.  I am confident that I have made the right decision for myself and my family."
