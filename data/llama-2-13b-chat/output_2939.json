        "Summarize the following story in first person: In March of 2019 I went to the doctor to get my blood pressure medicine refilled. The doctor also did was blood work. When the results returned the doctor saw I had a high PSA count. It was 12. 391 and for a man my age it should have been less than 4. After a biopsy, the doctor informed me that I have prostate cancer. Then the doctor informed me that for my age surgery would be the best way to treat my cancer. I decided to go ahead with the surgery and have my prostate removed. I had prostate surgery on Aug. 20, 2019 and had my prostate removed. I have a return appointment on October 8, 2019 to check my PSA levels. Hopefully everything will fine. If all is good I will have my PSA levels checked every 3 months for the first year. Then every 6 months for a couple years. If all is good then the doctor will check my PSA levels once a year there after. This was an unexpected life event for me!"
