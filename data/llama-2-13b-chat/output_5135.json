        "Summarize the following story in first person: I have been in a relationship with a man that was verbally, psychologically, financially, and sometimes physically abusive for the past 17 years. I have told him to leave, but he won't. And because he has been living here with me, the authorities won't evict him, even though everything is in my name and he doesn't have a job. I have told him it was over and was still pursuing legal steps to get him out of my residence. Last Tuesday, he attempted to kiss me. I pushed him away and rejected his attempt at affection. He lost it and began screaming at me and insulting me. I ignored this for awhile, but eventually became angry. Why should I have to put up with this anymore in my own home? He kept on until finally I couldn't take anymore. He was laying on the couch when I approached him and attempted to hit him. I don't even think I made contact, because at that time the dog attacked him. I have raised the dog since he was a puppy and the dog is very protective over me. The dog has also watched him be abusive to me previously, not to mention he picks on the dog constantly. The dog must have sensed my aggression towards him and reacted to it. i didn't make any move to stop the dog from attacking him, and just watched it. He ended up having to go to the hospital. He had to get 15 stitches in his hand, one of his fingers was broken, and he somehow broke a tooth during the attack. He has since come back to get some clothing, but otherwise has not returned to my home and is now considered legally evicted."
