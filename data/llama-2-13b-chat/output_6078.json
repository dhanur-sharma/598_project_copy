        "Summarize the following story in first person: About two months ago I decided to go the doctor because I have feeling really bad and my physical shape had been poor for a significant amount of time, so I asked my family and they all recommended to go a to physical check with the family internist. So the day came, I went and awaited while really feeling the anxiety and the feeling of being ill were not nice at all during those long hours that I had to wait to finally get my turn with the doctor. The consultation was normal, except for the last part when the internist told me he was worried about certain findings during the physical exam and the interrogation so he asked me to go to certain laboratory and do like 3 exams, so did I. I returned to the doctor's office and he gave me the diagnosis, testicular cancer. I could not believe what was happening at the moment, I got frustasted even though all the things that the doctor was explaining to me made sense and actually explained why I was feeling like that but it is not easy to accept this kind of news right away, it is just a hard pill to swallow. However I found certain strenght in me, I asked the doctor: \"what is the next step?\". He promptly answered me he will referred me to a specialist which he will guide in the following steps, that I should not lost any hope because my cancer was at the early stages so my chances were high to survive it. I immediatly went to the specialist's office and he examined me and he started talking about my case, he was making sure that I fully understood everything he was telling during our first consultation because it was key to start the treatment process. Then he gave me the steps to follow, what kind of diet should I have, what medicine will I be taking from now on and how regularly should I be coming to follow my case. The final outcome of this initial phase was preparing me to surgery because my situation was hopeful given the early detection. I followed the instructions given me to letter by letter because in my mind I was sure that I would not give up on living and being with my family. Weeks were passing by and I was starting to feel better, even though, I had to admit when I started taking the medication it was kind of hard getting used to this meds because they are really strong nothing like the usual stuff you would be taking for a cold. The last follow-up with the specialist was decisive, he gave priority and we set up the date for the surgery. I got home and it suddenly realized how big that day would be, it would mark a difference in my life. The date was getting closer and the anxiety was getting higher however I would not give up. The date came and the surgery was performed, everything went great. After a few days the specialist did a scan where there was not hints of cancer and I finally recover my opportunity to keep fighting in life."
