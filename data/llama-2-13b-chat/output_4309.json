        "Summarize the following story in first person: It's been two months since I saw the doctor for my problem.  Without warning, there were times I was hit with the sudden urge to pee and ended up holding it too long.  I knew that I probably had an infection, and I did.  I remember while I was waiting in the office thing that with my luck, it was quite possible that I would just wet my pants right there and then.  Holding my pee had become a regular habit for me.  It all started six months prior when I saw a family friend that I hadn't seen in awhile.  As soon as I saw him, my heart started pounding.  My stomach dropped to the floor and, of course, I had to pee right away.  All of the bad memories assaulted my mind in a matter of seconds.  The way he had sexually assaulted me those many years ago.  All of a sudden, it seemed like it had happened just seconds before.  So that was the day that holding my pee became a problem.  I wet myself and left in quite a hurry.  It was positively humiliating to me but I'm pretty sure no one else noticed because I left so quickly.  So now, it's a common problem.  I never know when it's going to hit me, but as soon as the flashbacks happen, the urge to pee always follows and I feel frozen in place trying to hold my pee.  I thought maybe it would stop after a few times but it seems to be going strong 6 months later and I'm at my wits end as to what to do.  The doctor had treated my infection but I suspected that I needed a therapist at this point.  Even though I'm feeling defeated, I'm also feeling oddly hopeful too."
