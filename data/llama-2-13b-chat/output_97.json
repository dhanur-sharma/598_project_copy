        "Summarize the following story in first person: During the last school year, I was forced to homeschool my two oldest children as the Christian school they used to attend closed. With public school out of the question (poor quality and too much liberal propaganda, thank you very much), I had to homeschool. Now, having to homeschool was something I dreaded even before my children were born. I hate teaching. I think everyone should do their job, the one they trained for.  Well, I never trained for teaching, and let's say I'm not a natural. Anyway, somehow I'd made it through the year. I learned to enjoy some parts of it, and my children made progress, but for the most part, I still hated it, and I'm afraid it showed. So when the year was over, I sat there and wondered what I was going to do next school year. I couldn't imagine homeschooling AGAIN, yet there seemed to be no other options. I checked other Christian and private schools in the area - way too expensive. I kept thinking about it, same thoughts circling in my mind. I went to get mail - and there was a letter from my kids' old school in the mailbox! At first, I thought maybe it was about some old bill I forgot to pay. I opened it... and I couldn't believe my eyes! It said the school was re-opening! With slightly lowered rates, too!! How do I describe this terrible weight instantly lifting off my shoulders? No more darn teaching!! My children will get to experience a normal classroom, teachers, and schoolmates. I was SO happy."
