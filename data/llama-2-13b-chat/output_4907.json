        "Summarize the following story in first person: Ever since I've lived on my own, I've been a little wild.  Experimenting with drugs was probably the first of it, and it never really stopped.  I wouldn't say I've ever had a \"problem,\" but it has made me view the world, and the people surrounding me differently, less judgmentally - maybe sometimes more judgmentally.  Recently, I was invited to a \"dance party under the stars,\" where I went to a swimming hole to camp in a town that no longer has a police force.  I did what I always do in these situations - I took psychedelic drugs and went on an adventure in my mind. But this time it was different - this time, no one else was doing the same.  For the first time, this \"hobby\" of mine I used to make friends and relate to people, made me an outcast.  I was alone, I was terrified - I was hiding in my car ripping my inner self to shreds and rebuilding who I was.  For eight hours, I hated who I was, what I was doing, and I just wanted to disappear, I wanted everyone to forget I existed - while simultaneously knowing how much it would hurt when I was forgotten.  I spent that night alone. While everyone else was dancing under the stars, drinking, and sharing love, I was hiding so no one would know what I had done.  In retrospect, I do not think I would have been as harshly judged as I felt like I was in that moment, but I do believe no one would have wanted to spend that evening with me anyways.  I missed out on a good time because I tried to make it better with substances. We are a sum of our experiences, we must take the good with the bad.  All my mistakes have made me who I am and I have grown from my experiences."
