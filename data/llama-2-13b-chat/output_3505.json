        "Summarize the following story in first person: Today I am meeting with a long time female friend whom I haven't seen in years. We are going to have dinner at Sam Snead's Steak and Lobster. This all started about 3 months ago when I was preparing for the release of my new EP.  I thought it would be a great idea to celebrate my birthday and the release show for my new album on the same day. It would be sort of a double celebration. My personal assistant felt it would be a good idea to go to Miami and spend my birthday there. The record company agreed and booked a very popular club on South Beach to have the party. I flew down to Miami a few days before the event, just to relax and take a break from all the stress of getting this record released. My personal assistant thought it would be good press for me to visit a local high school in the community and visit to talk with the students and I agreed.  Giving back has always been important to me and I personally feel that people of power and influence have an obligation to help others.  My assistant decided on Dade City High School as the school to visit.  She contacted the school and set everything up for me to come visit. When we arrived at the school, we checked in at the front office. I met the principal and he introduced me to the other people present in the office.  I signed autographs and took selfies with several of them.  Just as we were about to leave I heard this voice from behind me say, \"I always knew you were going to be a great musician.\" I turned around and saw a familiar face.... it was Cynthia Ortiz! As I walked up to her, I saw her name badge read \"Assistant Principal\".  One of the secretaries asked, \"you two know each other?\" Cynthia quickly chimed in, \"yes we do.....me and this gentleman were high school sweethearts.\" So that brings me up to tonight. After that high school visit, Cynthia and I started talking on a regular basis. I flew back to Miami last night to see her and have dinner. Who knows where this will lead, but I do think it was just more than a simple coincidence that after almost 15 years, we would run into each other like this."
