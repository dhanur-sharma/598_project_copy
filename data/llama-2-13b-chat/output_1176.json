        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last week, my wife and I went to Sanibel Island in Florida to spend some time at the beach. We had just a short amount of time to spend together to de-stress before school started again. Since we're both teachers, this was also our last time to spend together before the next school break. We also have two young children, so the added stress of spending time with them while trying to spend time together was a lot to deal with as a young, newly-wed couple. The beginning of the summer had been stressful for us because we had a lot of home repairs to do before the winter. We were quite financially strapped to get everything done that needed to be done. Many of the repairs were minor things that weren't going to require too much money. However, we also had major home repairs like getting our roof replaced that couldn't wait. Normally, we would have taken a longer, more extravagant vacation. We love traveling internationally, and we really wanted to have a chance to take a bit of time away from the children. Because of the money we had to put into our house, we were limited with where we could go and what we could do. We were able to share valuable memories despite the trip not being what we would normally do. One of the most amazing memories was when we actually fell asleep together on the beach one night, just talking and having a bit of wine. Waking up at dawn surrounded by the ocean and surf was a once in a lifetime opportunity. Now we'll rethink some of our more extravagant, luxury vacations just to have quiet moments like the night we slept on the beach together."
