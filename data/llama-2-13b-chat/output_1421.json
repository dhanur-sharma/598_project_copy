        "Summarize the following story in first person: This is regarding the diary entry I had from a month ago or so. It's about my first day of volunteering at the Humane Society. I can't have any dogs where I live and I love animals so I thought it might be a good idea to volunteer at the Humane Society. It's very close by so I don't have to travel very far. I went down there and signed up and the following day I had to go in for some basic dog training. They showed us how to put the lease on the dog and walk the dog properly and to keep them from getting in fights or into some type of trouble. The next day was my first day of volunteering. I took my first dog out for a spin. If I remember it was a lab/pitbull named Daisy. Daisy was quite a handful but we walked from the Humane Society to the nearby park  and around the park and then back to the Humane Society. I still had some time left with Daisy so I took her out into the yard behind the main society and toss the ball around to her. After that I took her to her cage and then spent some time with all of the cats that they have there. I also stopped by and visited with a couple of rabbits and the hamster. That was my first day at the Humane Society. I enjoyed myself and I will definitely go back there again. While I have the most fun with the dogs, I do spend time with the cats as well because they need human visitors too. I never believed that I contribute much to society but even though I'm working with animals, ultimately they end up with owners and I've helped the animal get adjusted to humans. This is better than doing absolutely nothing with my free time."
