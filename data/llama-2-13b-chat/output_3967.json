        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was the best man at my brother's wedding that happened about 3 months ago. His in-laws had given me the responsibility of holding the bride's ring, which was their family ring passed down from generations. I used to keep it in my pocket all the time. I was having beer and spilled some on my pants. The next day I gave it to the laundry without realizing it had the ring inside its pockets. I was scared for my life. I called the laundry and they told me that the pant has already been left for the cleaning services. On the next day, I rushed to receive my pants. When I took them over, I checked its pockets and I did not find anything! I was about to faint. 2 minutes later, the manager came, and asked me, \"Are you looking for this mister?\". It was indeed a sign of relief I promise. I could not thank God enough. I still never told this incident to anyone else. Even the ring smelled like detergent, nobody ever became suspicious."
