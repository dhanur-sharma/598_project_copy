        "Summarize the following story in first person: A few months ago I met a man through a dating app whom I was able to make a connection with fairly quickly. We started seeing each other, but as time went on, it became evident that distance and lack of time were going to be issues in pursuing anything further. I brought it up to him a few times and he brushed it away, saying we'd figure it out eventually. He did come to see the same issues I did and confess that he didn't see any way of making any more time for the relationship in the foreseeable future. On my end, my own financial issues and obligations kept me from being able to close the gap on my end either.  It was heartbreaking for me, because I have been single following a divorce for several years and hadn't had much luck meeting anyone, and I really liked him. We decided to stay friends even though he seemed fairly insensitive to my experience. As we continued spending time together as friends, we decided to try to make a relationship work again, coming from a place of increased understanding and better communication. Since the event, things have been going much better between the two of us, so ultimately, what was very sad at the time, turned into something positive. Confronting the issue of not having enough time, he has tried to be in contact more frequently and to make an effort to spend more time together. In service of that, he has introduced me to his daughter, so we can all spend time together. I have also made an effort to go to his place more frequently. I've met his parents as well. Communication has been important to both of us. I feel like there is a possibility this may all work out."
