        "Summarize the following story in first person: So currently at work I'm nothing special just a little bit more in the higher when you have a regular employee. I don't get to supervise and I don't get to tell people what to do yet. Normally when it's time for promotions to her my job creates projects Which are meant to test all of the skills that we have learned throughout our work. Mind You i work as a graphic arts and designer So you never completely learn everything there is to know about the job. In this particular project we were being tested on how to make 3-D animation's like anime come to life and make a short trailer for an upcoming show that we really liked. The price for the person who improves the nurse was a supervisor position. Needless to say I was ecstatic we had exactly one month to prepare the trailer and present it to the company. Need list to say there were some people that didn't believe that I could actually do it even though I had one previous project promotion. Even though there was a lot of people putting me down I worked and Leslie and tired Leslie until my trailer was perfect and there was not a single flaw.  Some people didn't start working on the project till two weeks prior but I didn't waste any time and started the day that the project was given. Even so I didn't think that the mass was long enough for us to completely perfect this trailer but I did the best I could. When the time came for me to present my project people were snickering and laughing and honestly thought that I didn't have anything good. I honestly can't believe that people like this exist in such a professional workplace it blows my mind. That's besides the point, so then when I presented my trailer I saw everyone's charge dropped including the big bosses. Needless to say I won the promotion of supervisor and honestly couldn't be more elated and excited. The moral of this is that no matter how big or small your dream is or whatever you put your mind to you can do anything you wish. People will always be around to put you down but honestly you have to turn that around and make your motivation to do the best you can."
