        "Summarize the following story in first person: A few weeks ago, our family took an outing to a new food market in Washington, DC. We had family visiting from out of town and it was really fun to get together. The food market was outdoors and had all kinds of different vendors. All of us wanted to try different things.  We each walked around looking at all the choices and then made our selections. We found a table where we could all enjoy our lunch together. It was a beautiful day and there were tons of people outside. We each tried some of each other's food. We saw lots of people walking their dogs. We had fun looking at all the different breeds of dogs. That led us to tell funny stories about the dogs we have owned during our lives. After lunch we went for ice cream. The place where we went is famous in our city. We each tried different flavors. They were very unusual.  This was an awesome summer day that I will remember for a long time."
