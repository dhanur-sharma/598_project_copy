        "Summarize the following story in first person: I will never forget the day our beloved dog Indy passed away. It was one of the most horrific experiences I've ever been through. It was a cold morning. It has snowed the night prior. Indy was waiting by the door as she usually does, waiting to go for our morning walk. I was a bit nervous on this particular morning to take her since we live right along the highway so you have to be very cautious of the drivers whizzing past. She was very persistent with her attempts to get me to grab the lash. Nudging my hand, barking and whining continuously. I gave her a pat on the head, put the leash on her and we set off for a morning walk that would ultimately be our last. Indy is a very strong dog. She a Pit bull Labrador mix so she has a lot of pull when I'm walking her. There seemed to be much more traffic this morning than usual. She kept tugging the leash, trying to run out into the street. I yelled \"stop it Indy!\" \"your gonna get us killed!\" I tried to see if maybe there was another dog or a cat or something that was provoking her to act in this manner but there was nothing across the highway that I could see. The traffic was getting heavier and she was really acting up now so I decided that we should head back early. I pulled out my phone to let my husband know we were heading back.  I guess it was the wrong move to make because I loosened my grip on Indy's leash for a moment and then it happened. She darted out into the road right as a massive semi truck was about to pass us and like that... she was gone.  The truck didn't even stop. It just kept going. I will never forget it. Her body was in pieces all over the road. I started vomiting. People were trying to swerve around her then I almost got hit. I picked myself up and ran as fast as I could to inform my husband of the terrible news."
