        "Summarize the following story in first person: My teenage daughter told me two days ago that she is bisexual. I am a very conservative, religious person, and she has always gone to church and expressed similar values, so this was a shock. She didn't know how to tell me, so she wrote a note and gave it to me. After reading it, I just hugged her and held her and told her I would always love her. We both cried for a long time. It is so hard growing up today. There are so many confusing messages coming from so many different places. It is a scary world, and the one place a kid should feel safe and accepted is at home. I hope my daughter always feels that way. She said her biggest fear was that we would treat her differently now. I told her we might have to muddle through some awkward questions and conversations together, but that I will be here to support her health and happiness. I think all moms worry about whether they are good enough or if there was some point in some area where they failed their kids. I am wrestling with these questions now. I have a renewed determination to be connected and present with my kids. I think our family can and will grow stronger and closer."
