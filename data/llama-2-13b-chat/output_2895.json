        "Summarize the following story in first person: I just found out some really tough news today.  My old girlfriend Susan, who I dated as a teenager, is dying of breast cancer.  I have a lot of emotions about this.  We didn't keep in touch - I really don't think it was that serious.  I haven't talked to her in years, but I heard it from my friend Jimmy who still talks to her sometimes.  I have a lot of good memories of her, and I feel really guilty now that I did not stay in contact with her.  Who knows what she's like now?  I remember how into her I was for a few years though.  She's way too young to have to deal with this.  I wonder what happened to her in between then and now.  I'm not sure if I should reach out.  She probably would not want to hear from me after all this time.  She's so young too.  This makes me think about my own life a lot.  I don't want to have to worry about things like this happening to me, but I'm not getting any younger.  I'm still in my thirties, but so was she.  I guess you never really know what the future will bring."
