        "Summarize the following story in first person: I have always been proud that Hawaiian blood courses through my veins. That's why recent news of Mauna Kea emphatically hit me. Native Hawaiians are fighting construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope on sacred land. Unfortunately, it's an oft-repeated tale as ancient as time itself. As the traditional guardians of their lands, indigenous communities have tried and tried again to protect what is theirs, bucking against forces with systemic authority and deep pockets. And it's not usually the native populations who win in the end. What's happening with Mauna Kea is \"no different than what they did to the Native American Indians in Arizona,For the Native Hawaiians, it is not a question of faith against science. It's cultural preservation versus blind commercialism \u2013 the prioritization of capital over human interest. Located on the Big Island, Mauna Kea is not only an inactive volcano, but also the globe's highest sea mountain. For a decade now, international scientists have aimed to build the $1.4 billion project on the land, due to the absence of both light pollution and moisture in the air. Supporters favor the predicted economic growth with accompanying job opportunities. But the plan has encountered indigenous opposition every step of the way. At this point, thousands of Hawaiians have engaged in peaceful protest, blocking passage to the summit. K\u016bpuna, or elders, gather at the forefront. 30 elders were arrested at the the Mauna Kea access road as they attempted to block construction crews from proceeding up the mountain. They are not disputing technological progress, but pushing to maintain a sacred site of Hawaiian spirituality. Already the summit hosts 13 other telescopes that dishonor Mauna Kea's true purposes. Mauna Kea means respecting the earth. With its delicate ecosystem, the mountain and its endangered species face threats from human development, like habitat loss. Ultimately, it means native rights. So much social justice nowadays centers around finally giving indigenous communities \u2013 peoples with irrefutable historic connections to these lands \u2013 their duThanks to international media coverage and campaigns to #ProtectMaunaKea, the Thirty Meter Telescope announced a potential alternative to construct on the Canary Islands. But the battle is far from over."
