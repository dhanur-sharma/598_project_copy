        "Summarize the following story in first person: Two weeks ago our cat, Baby Kitty, disappeared for several days.  Our family went crazy looking for her.  It got so bad that I was trying to think of how to gently break her disappearance to our daughter.  Baby Kitty could usually be found in our daughter's presence.   Whenever she would get upset, Baby Kitty would help calm her down.  When we finally found her she couldn't even stand up.  We got her to an emergency vet right away.  He told us we were lucky we got to her when we did.  With the snowstorm coming, it wouldn't have been good if she got caught in it.  The vet made a splint for her hind leg, apparently Baby Kitty broke it, we don't know how.  The vet believes a car might have nicked her.  My daughter brought in a notepad to the vet so she could take down notes for Baby Kitty's recovery.  At home, my daughter declared that she will take care of Baby Kitty to make sure she gets better.  Two weeks have gone by since the incident, and Baby Kitty is doing a lot better.  The vet wants to see us in another two weeks to take some x-rays to make sure the bones are healing well.  True to my daughter's words, she has taken care of Baby Kitty and sees to her every need, when Baby Kitty lets her."
