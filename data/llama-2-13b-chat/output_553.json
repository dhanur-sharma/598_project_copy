        "Summarize the following story in first person: My youngest child's birthday party was somewhat hard to plan. My husband was working second shift again at that time and so her party had to be on a weekend so that he should have the day off, but even that was not a promise. The weather was still cold enough at times that we knew it had to be an indoor party or we might get rained out. We ended up renting a building at one of the parks close by and decided to hold the party there. My dad and brother brought a heater over hours ahead of time so that we could warm up the building, even though the rules said we were not allowed to have a heater there, it was just too cold, so we watched it closely. My husband cooked BBQ pulled pork and shredded chicken for the guest and my mother made an amazing cake and cupcakes. The cake was a decorate rice-crispy treat and the cupcakes were chocolate, all were made to look like Minny Mouse. We noticed that we forgot a cooler for the pops but it was so cold out and there was snow on the ground still so we just set the cases of pop outside the door to the building. No reason to run back into town when nature was providing its own cooler for us.  My sister and one of her friends also showed up early to help decorate. A decent amount of people showed up but we all had a good time. My mom got her sugar glider out to show people and it ended up jumping on everyone's heads. It even jumped on my oldest and she freaked out and ran into a table. After making sure she was alright we found it kind of funny since sugar gliders are not dangerous animals at all. My youngest spent most of her time crawling around the building and being passed from one person to another but right after presents were opened and people were getting ready to leave she decided to surprise everyone and took a couple of steps. It wasn't much, but it was a start. I was also impressed that my mother-in-law showed up for the party because we had invited other family members that she dose not get along with as well and she usually tires to avoid them. Thankfully there were no problems and everyone had a great time."
