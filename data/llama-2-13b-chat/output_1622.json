        "Summarize the following story in first person: Growing up in a small town is fun but it also has limits. I knew that if I ever wanted to make something of myself I would need to leave home and find my footing. My step father signed me up for college and I didn't have a choice so I went. It was a huge cultural shock but one of the highlights of my life. I literately made it through 5 years of college with only a little change in my pocket. I never knew that I could be proud of myself but when they handed me my diploma and everyone cheered I knew at the moment that I did something worthy. Going through high school was required but completing college was determination. I knew that I had done something to better my family and my future. We ended up eating at a restaurant when the graduation was over and my family gave truly emotional toasts in my honor. Even though their words were kind and inspiring I did not need them this time. I was actually proud of myself and what I had accomplished through hard work. I even interviewed for a teaching job a week later and was employed. We all face hardships but it's about determination and resilience. I knew I wanted to make a bigger impact on the world.  I hope that I impact my students lives like my others did for me."
