        "Summarize the following story in first person: 4 months ago I had the best time. It is something I will never forget. It happened right before we stayed the night at my cousin's house in Goodlettsville. We went to a theme park that just opened up an hour away. Their rides were out of this world! They have one roller coaster that was the highest and fastest than any other roller coaster out there. I felt like I was flying on that thing. I also screamed so loud that I swore my lungs jumped out of my mouth briefly! The only bummer about that ride was since it was new, I had to wait an hour and a half. Ick! However, there were also other rides that were fun. I rode on an old-school coaster. It didn't go too fast or upside down, but it was still pretty neat! Then there was a raffle going off to win tickets to go to the park another time. The raffle went off in the evening and the people who were there would be the ones to win. Two different numbers were called and they weren't there. Then the next number was mine! I was so shocked and very happy. This is a day/night I will always remember."
