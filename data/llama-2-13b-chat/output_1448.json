        "Summarize the following story in first person: This was a recent event that happened in my life. I was visiting my girlfriend's family and we were having a good time at her mom's boyfriend's house where we were all playing Super Smash Brothers Ultimate and enjoying some good food. However, while I was there and we were all relaxing I received a call from my mother who asked if I had spoken to one of my best friends. I replied and told her that I had been texting him but he hadn't replied for a while. She told me that she didn't know if it was true but that something had happened to his mother. I asked her what had happened and my mom told me that his mom had passed away. This was a weird situation as I had known his mother for almost my whole adult life so it didn't really feel as if it was possible for it to happen. I denied it immediately assuming it was a rumor since we all didn't know for sure. After about half an hour to an hour, my dad called me (he works with my best friends mom) and told me that it was, in fact, true. My best friend's mom had passed away. There were no words to describe the feeling I felt. I didn't know what to say or how to act towards my best friend. This was a situation that was completely foreign to me. I had lost other people in my life but not anyone as close as a mother. It was a tough time but we all go through it and moved forward."
