        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last night there was a funny situation in my bedroom. Our dog usually stays in our room because he has his spot on the bed. He's been sleeping in there for the six months or so every night. Sometimes he spends the whole day in there. He's pretty stubborn when it comes to being able to do exactly what he wants to do. My daughter wanted to take him to her room but he refused pretty comically. The most surprising bit of the event was when she used ripped up tortillas to lure him into her room, but he just took them and ran back to the bed with them to eat. I kept getting up an consoling him when she was trying to get him out of bed, he really doesn't like doing things he doesn't want to do. Since I'm the pack leader of the house, he mostly comes to me when he's scared or not feeling well. My wife was in the room and she was laughing so hard it hurt her sides, that was the part that stood out the most. She's generally a funny person and laughs a lot but this really put her over the edge. I really love good memories with my family. It was a nice way to end the night, kinda like icing on the cake of a great day. I found out the next morning that she had gotten him into the room while I was sleeping.  She sent me pictures of it today."
