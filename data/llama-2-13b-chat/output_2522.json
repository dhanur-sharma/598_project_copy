        "Summarize the following story in first person: 2 months back my cousin came to my home to stay with me and my husband. My husband is very much targeted on obedience and some of the responsibilities than one should follow in their own life. So he gave some advise and his own thoughts on responsibilities to my cousin. She get bored and she normally will not take any advise from others.  She tried to tolerate his advise about the responsibility. But he keep on telling her about the way we should live our life and some more advise to lead a successful life. She is very talkative and open minded person. So she told him that not to give her such advise and told that she knows all the way to lead a happy ans satisfied life. But over a time she can not keep on hear his words. So she got upset and left our home. In between the arrival and her fed up with my husband they were really good friends and will be keep on chatting and talking with each other for a long time. Then also she was very much eager in spending time with us in her holidays and she has more plans to spend the days with us.  But unfortunately there was a misunderstanding between them and they really hate each other to which i could not even imagine the scene. It is very crucial. My husband also will not at all understand that it is not good to compel ones life like the way they like. It is really not good for the persons who are giving advise without their willing and getting advise without any satisfaction. The same thing happened in my life. I could not even control the fight between them. And it is not good to get out of the house with a sorrow in ones heart. It is not fair to do such a thing. My cousin then not at all even talk to me and my husband. Then after few months she picked my call and talked to me just for a sake and then kept the phone call. Then i have tried to make her convince and called her daily and make my husband to understand her feelings and then made them to talk to each other. It is really very hard to make her convince. I really took the effort to make her feel good and then made an day out with her in the next holiday."
