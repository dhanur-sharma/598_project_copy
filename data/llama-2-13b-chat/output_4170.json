        "Summarize the following story in first person: What a day. Julie and her kids came to visit us today. This creaky home of ours always come alive when the grandkids come along. My daughter came over to give us our set of photos from the disposable cameras we had on our trip to California two or three months ago.    The photos turned out beautiful! John and I went to a few theme parks with the grandkids while my wife and my daughter went shopping at Rodeo Drive. Remind me never to say yes to Disney ever again or I'll end up 6 feet under by 65! Thank god I had my son-in-law to help keep the twins in check. I might've lost the kids one too many times but let's not let the missus find out. The twins made me wear a Mickey ears headband and got me joining them in the face painting queue. I never knew I'd look good with a tiger painted on my right side. Might have to bring that up to my wife and maybe get myself a new tattoo hah! It's unfortunate that the pictures we took at the beach did not turn out as good. It's probably because of the Sun exposure. Still, there's a good handful of photos of the twins messing around with me. Those rascals buried me in the sand and made me look like a mermaid when I was asleep! We had our annual sandcastle building competition. It was the twins and I versus Julie and John. It was obvious that we were going to win.... until the waves crashed into our castle. The girls cried but then John \"accidentally\" tripped and fell over their castle. We ended that day with a draw and spent the rest of the day swimming. I'm glad that I have these photos to look back on when things get rough. I don't have that many years left to my life but god, I only wish for safety and happiness for my family. Look over them for me when I'm gone."
