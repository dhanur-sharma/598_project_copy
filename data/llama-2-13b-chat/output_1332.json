        "Summarize the following story in first person: Over the weekend I took a trip to Canada with some of my old friends to be with Joe for his bachelor's trip.  We all flew out of Indianapolis together and that was when the fun started.  We all sat together on the plane and chatted about old times.  It was great to catch up with everyone and I felt a little guilty that I haven't kept in better contact with them over the years.  We all used to be so close and now life has taken us in different directions.  When we arrived in Canada we immediately checked into our hotel and went out to dinner.  It was a fantastic meal and we continued our conversations from the plane and continued to catch up with each others lives.  We also visited museums and even watched a professional basketball game.  We were having the best time and I was so glad to be there until Joe pulled me aside after several drinks after dinner the second night there.  He confessed that back in college he had slept with my then girlfriend, which is now my wife.  He said the guilt has been eating away at him and he felt I deserved to know.  I'm crushed.  My wife and I have a great relationship and I'm totally blindsided by the confessions.  I don't even know what to do with the information-it clearly happened a long time ago, it was a one time thing, I'm happily married now.  I'm not sure what to do."
