        "Summarize the following story in first person: My grandfather is one of the strongest men that I know. He was always doing for others before he would even think about himself. When he started to slow down, we all knew that something was wrong with me. This was not like him at all. He never slowed down. They finally admitted him to the hospital to figure out why he was going so poorly.  He probably saw thirty doctors while he was inside the hospital. No one could figure out what was going on with him. We were all loosing hope that Grandpa would ever be the same again. Finally we met a blessing of a doctor who ran the right test and figured it out! It was truly a simple fix and within days he was doing better than he has ever been, even before going to the hospital. He finally got discharged and we took him home. He was going everywhere again. Going to the store didn't both him at all anymore. He had a lot more energy. We are so thankful to that special doctor."
