        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 3 months ago, something amazing happened! My sister, to whom I have been estranged for over 10 years, reached out to me and sent me a letter. I was completely shocked, I never thought I would hear from her again. I know that I hurt her, and I didn't deserve to have her as a sister anymore, so when I saw the letter in the mailbox, my heart dropped to the ground. I immediately thought it must be bad news, like a death in the family or something...surely there was no other reason for her to write to the person she hated most in the world. It took me 3 days to open it, because I was so unsure about how the contents would change my life. When I finally got the nerve to read it, I was shocked. She wrote to tell me that she forgave me. And she missed me. And she was sorry for cutting me out of her life, and that she regretted all of the wasted time. She was sure to say that although what I had done was unforgivable, we all do unforgivable things at some point in our lives. And that she had finally gotten to a place in her relationship with God that she was ready to forgive me and move on. She gave me her phone number, and said I was welcome to call if I wanted to. I am so glad that God was able to heal her heart, I didn't think that would ever happen. I am looking forward to getting to know my sister again! And, showing her how much I really love her and I am sorry."
