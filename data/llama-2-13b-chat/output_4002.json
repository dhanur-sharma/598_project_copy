        "Summarize the following story in first person: Mom has been dead for three months now and I still don\u2019t know how I feel about it. I\u2019m still trying to process everything that happened that weekend and I wonder if I could have done anything differently. Would she still be alive if I\u2019d stayed home? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019d been taking care of mom for five years, after her dementia got bad enough that she wasn\u2019t safe to allow to live by herself anymore. Over time it\u2019d gotten more and more difficult as she was less and less capable of taking care of herself or understanding why I wanted her to do things like eat and drink and bathe. My sisters and brothers haven\u2019t been much help at all. They live far away and aren\u2019t willing to disrupt their lives to chip in. It was an absolute nightmare. Her health had been stable for a while so I decided to take a well deserved break to catch my breath. I arranged for her to spend the weekend in respite care, which was incredibly expensive mind you, so that I could have some peace. I really thought she\u2019d be ok. They said she had a stroke. I guess it happened pretty fast. One minute she was being helped to use the comode and then suddenly she slumped over and it was like the lights went out. They rushed her to the hospital but she died only a couple hours later. There's nothing I could have done but I wish I had been there with her."
