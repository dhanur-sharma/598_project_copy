        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was concerned about the number of times my mother had fallen recently.  I was extremely nervous to be with her and watch her walk, and I was nervous to not be there and watch her walk.  She fell when she was less than a foot away from me.  It happened so quickly, that I had no chance to help her or slow her fall.  I realized at that time that it didn't matter whether I was there or not, she was deteriorating and she would fall again.  I knew that at some point, she would break a bone. That is exactly what happened.  She broke a bone in her wrist when  I wasn't there.  I was actually quite relieved when the hospital suggested rehab.  I hoped it would help strengthen her.  I also hoped that the rehab center would be able to convince her to use her walker, as I had been unable to do. She worked hard at rehab and was getting stronger.  She was never strong enough to go home, and she passed quietly in her sleep.  I had hoped that she would be able to come home again.  He had worked hard to keep everything just the way she liked things at her house."
