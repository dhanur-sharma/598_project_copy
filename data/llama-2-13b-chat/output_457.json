        "Summarize the following story in first person: About a week ago I was heading home after I went to starbucks for my daily coffee, it was a rainy afternoon and the street was quite busy. Lots of cars drove by, kicking up water and dirt as they sped through. I was in a rather bad mood as I dont very much care for the rain in Seattle. As I was walking home, I noticed an old man sitting on a bench, he had dirty unkempt gray hair hidden by a rather old beanie. A dark tan coat dirtied by years of reliance, his face was pale with grime throughout. He had been on the bench for quite a while, I'd seen him around town before. As I walked closer, I could see tears rolling down his cheeks. He was crying, silently, of course. The look of utter misery in his face prompted me to inquire into why exactly he was crying. I had never asked someone why they were crying like this before, I didnt exactly know how to approach the man so I awkwardly shambled close to him and sat down.\"What's wrong sir? I noticed you were crying.\" I asked softly.\"I'm extremely sick, I went to the free clinic and I've found that I have no chance of life more than a few months. That's whats wrong, now if you'd leave me be, I'd appreciate it.\"He looked quite defeated in that moment, like nothing mattered in that moment. I decided the only real thing I could do was hand him my cup of coffee, as a small reminder of some good in the world.\"I can't offer much to your situation, but here you go, a fresh cup. Enjoy what little time you have left, man.\" These words probably sounded more offensive than anything, he silently took the cup and muttered a thanks. I felt slightly better, the mans plea had dug into my heart and left me quite pained. I wasn't quite sure what to do with myself as I headed home.  I felt as if I'd made a difference but I couldn't be sure/"
