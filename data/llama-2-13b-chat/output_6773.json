        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 5 months ago the best thing to ever happen to me occurred on 4/5. That's the day I officially started dating the love of my life. The day started out as normal as any but the evening I had a party to attend. I invited my now boyfriend to come to this party with me. He is involved in the sport, wrestling, that the party was for and also knew many of the other people there. We both had a ton of fun. There were several people there, good food and drinks. Immediately he went over and started chatting with my dad and quickly my dad knew that he wanted me to be with this man. We continued to bounce around and have fun but eventually we headed back to our apartment. At the time we were living together as friends. When we got back we started talking about feelings and what we wanted in the future. Everything seemed to be aligning perfectly. Finally he looked at me and said \"are you in?\" I looked back with a big grin on my face and said \"Yes, I'm in\". Ever since that day we've been nearly inseparable except when he is spending time with my dad. That night had a huge impact on me and I will forever remember it."
