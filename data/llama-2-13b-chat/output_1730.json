        "Summarize the following story in first person: There is one event that I will never forget for the rest of my life that happened recently. I was working in the labor & delivery floor of Kaiser San Francisco for my nursing rotation. I remember being quite anxious because I was a male, and I assumed that it would be hard to gain experience since women may not like having a male in their delivery rooms. However, it was the opposite of what I expected.  I have always wondered what it would be like to watch the birth of a baby. All I hear are stories from my mom about the stress of it because she had four of us. It all started during my second week on the floor. I met a patient who was due to have her baby on the same day. She was with her husband. I don't remember their names, but I do remember their faces and the entire experience. The nurse I was working with advocated for me to be in the room to assist with the birthing process. I remember how long it took and how tiring it was for the patient to push for over two hours in order for the baby to come out. It was all so beautiful. I was able to help hold one of her legs up while the other nurse held the other leg. When the doctor delivered the baby, I almost cried. It was one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen. Can you imagine being the first person that a baby sees in this world? It was such a joyous experience. I hope one day that I will get to do it again with my own children."
