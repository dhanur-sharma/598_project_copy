        "Summarize the following story in first person: On July 9, 2019 I moving in with my Celia.  This is kinda weird, because this is the first time I have ever moved in with a partner. I have had partners where we would spend 10 straight nights together with Dayni or Olivia, but we never reached the point where we had a dresser or permanent spot for clothes/ accessories.   Walking through the door was such a rush of excitement and washing away of nerves to see the place I will be living in finally.  It is crazy to be moving all the way across the country to chase down a relationship, but this is a crazy amazing opportunity.  I'm so grateful that I decided to go off and take this risk as well as my parents supporting it.  There contribution to make this happen really makes it all possible.  The sadness of really having my friends and family so far gone, is at least now not present, because of my focus on the now. It's so reassuring to see Celia's perkiness and hear the positivity in her voice.  It is such a reaffirmation of the decision to watch her show me her place that she has shown me so much before but only through her phone.  It is midday and it is hot up here.  That doesn't get in the way of just pressing her body so tightly to the side of mine as she talks about each room.  The heat is like melting us together and I feel that close to her.  Just energy of joy is bounding through my body.  Each part of the tour is revealing a part of my future, however long or short it is. As the day goes on, I still feel like a guest in the house, but that feeling is slowly riding away.  Celia prepared a wonderful salad for us for dinner, which is just not her thing.  It was great though, because it was her way of going out of her way to make this a great first day.  Washing the dishes with her really made me feel closer and more part of the homeness that I hope to settle into.  Cuddling up to the first netflix and chill and this new place really has the sense of belonging taking over.  Finding a good groove to sit in felt like I was making a long term investment.  While she laid under my arm it placed over her like a puzzle piece fitting in. It feels like the right decision and that this is going to be a positive experience no matter how it ends."
