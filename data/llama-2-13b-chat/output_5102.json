        "Summarize the following story in first person: My wife and I have been trying to get pregnant for a few months now. We've had some issues but through it we've remained positive and that positivity eventually worked out for us. A few months ago, my wife decided to take a pregnancy test because she was late on her time of the month. A couple of minutes later she came to me with tears in her eyes, extremely happy, and when I asked her what was up she told me that what we had been hoping for was finally going to happen. We were obviously very excited about it, we hugged and kissed and teared up very ready for this to finally be happening. We talked about it for a little while and then decided to go and get breakfast and discuss it over a meal. We ended up going to McDonald's and sitting down at a table, I believe she ordered a sausage McMuffin and I ordered an egg McMuffin. We talked there for a long time about a lot of different things having to do with preparation and telling our parents. We even discussed things like names if it were a boy or girl, we both wanted to have a boy but would obviously be thrilled with a girl as well. We talked about how we would tell our parents, she had a lot of ideas on the subject and I pretty well just went along with whatever she thought. We even talked about more obscure things like how our two cats would get along with the baby, or what to dress them for as Halloween. It was a moment in time that I think I will always remember, it's a joy that I don't really know if I can accurately articulate. In the back of my mind I've always wanted to be a father, I didn't know if I was ready for it but I think that I am. However that being said it's a scary thought to be one of two people solely responsible for bringing another human into this world, it's a big commitment. I'm really looking forward to it though, I think that we are up to the task. She's a ways along now and it's thrilling to know that our little boy or girl will be here before we know it, we're both very excited."
