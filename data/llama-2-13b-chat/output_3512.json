        "Summarize the following story in first person: We were bored of the city life. Hence we decided to move to a house on country side. In the mean time we also know that our daughter's birthday was coming in six months. So myself and my spouse decided to buy a house on country side and give as a birthday gift to our daughter. My daughter was also interested in riding horses, hence country side house would help her in developing skills on horse riding. As promise we kept the plan as a surprise. We approached real estate agents in search of the house. Finally we found a house and bought it before a month from my daughter's birthday. She was eagerly asking about her birthday gift because she can't tolerate surprises. Her birthday arrived three months ago and we arranged a party in our house. On the party, my spouse wished to say the surprise gift to our daughter. After the cake cutting celebration, my spouse showed the new house agreement to our daughter. Our daughter was really shocked and was unable to speak for few minutes. She hugged us and expressed her happiness of the gift she received. She immediately shared the news to her friends and enjoyed the party."
