        "Summarize the following story in first person: In July 2019, I made the decision to travel to a new state to meet friends from the internet that I had never met in person before. While I had met people from the internet in person in the past, this was the first time I was traveling overnight away from my home to do so. I would be visiting them in their home in Ohio. I was coming from Illinois, another internet friend was coming from New York, and we were meeting up with the 3rd friend in Ohio. I was nervous during the drive to Ohio. I had never been in the area before, and I didn't know anyone else in the area I could turn to in case things did not go as well as planned. Luckily, I was the first to arrive at the house, and I was finally able to meet my friend Tam in person. We were able to hang out and feel comfortable around one another like we had been friends for years (we had only spoken online for about 1 year). Soon, the 3rd person (Judy) arrived and we all had dinner together. There were a few awkward pauses, but for the post part, the trip went well and we all had a great time. We traveled around the Columbus area, went to a few different malls and went out for food and drinks. We all stayed in the same house and spent the evenings cooking together, watching movies and generally bonding and learning about each others lives and experiences. Overall, it was a very fun and memorable weekend. We are trying to plan another get together, but since we all live in different states and have busy lives, it is difficult to coordinate and time and place. I do hope that we can all get together again soon."
