        "Summarize the following story in first person: Today, I ended up talking with my ex again. We always end up talking, monthly. But today I realized that I wasn't always right. He had done so much wrong that it blinded me to everything. I wanted him to make up for everything bad he's done, without giving the opportunity for him, as a person, to be able to make it up to me how he could. It was an impossible task and impossible standards that I kept asking of him. I couldn't see past myself, I could only see me and how wounded I was. It might mean that the damage has been done, but this different perspective has given me a lot to think about now. How often have we cycled through the same thing over and over again with no change, because I'd been insisting he needs to be different without giving him a chance to be so. I ask him to jump and want no hesitation, but he's always been the type to hesitate. I just really didn't take into account who he was, and how we could compromise or come to a solution. At this point in time I'm still processing the information, the feelings, and what it all means. I feel more confused now than I have ever been. It's funny, because you don't ever want to see yourself in a bad light especially when truly, you were hurt the most. He DID do bad things, I'm not negating that, but I also have been expecting some changes that are probably impossible. I would get overwhelmed talking to me too, the way I have been. I can only hope to learn from it if not for this relationship, than any in the future."
