        "Summarize the following story in first person: A few months ago, I was not in the greatest situation. I had recently been laid off of work and my job search had been completely unfruitful. I had some savings for a situation such as this, but my funds were beginning to run low. I had rent to pay and groceries to buy, but I was beginning to become very stressed as my bank accounts were quickly approaching zero. This hit point break when my balance was finally down to two figures. I wouldn't be able to afford any of my upcoming expenses. Having reached total desperation, I reached out to my fairly estranged brother. We hadn't been close since before our parents had both passed away, but I had no other choice. I called him and was greeted with a cold, uncaring tone. I explained the situation to him and was on the edge of my seat waiting for his response. His reply was one of complete apathy. He said he had no obligation to take care of somebody just because they were related and that he had his own problems to deal with. I was shocked, but completely unsurprising at the same time. He had always been very selfish and self-interested, but I thought just maybe this would create a single act of decency from him. Luckily, I ended up surviving by nearly starving myself and spending a decent amount of time in shelters before I found a minimum wage job that allowed me to get back on my feet."
