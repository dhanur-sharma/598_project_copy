        "Summarize the following story in first person: My best friend, whom I've haven't actually seen in person in nearly seven years, came to visit me for my birthday this past year. They had arranged to come up and stay for a long weekend so we would have plenty of time to just hang out and catch up. They finally had a chance to see the home I bought a few years ago as well as meet my partner for the first time. We had made reservations at a new restaurant we all were excited to try out, which turned out to be fantastic. We stuffed ourselves with steak and garlic pork, had a few drinks. We told old stories and laughed about dumb things we used to do when we were younger. The restaurant knew it was my birthday and brought out this enormous piece of dessert with the plate decorated with cocoa powder and the words Happy Birthday in melted chocolate. Even though we were full to the brim, we managed to knock that dessert down! The next couple days passed in a sort of blur. We didn't actually go out and do much of anything special, but we stayed up late every night, talked about every topic under the sun. Just like we used to. When it was finally time to say goodbye, it was a little rough. I didn't want them to go so soon, as it seemed like they had just gotten there. They didn't want to go either, for the same reasons. We both cried a little as they drove away. It was a great visit and we are already making plans for the next one!"
