        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was diagnosed with Breast Cancer. I accidentally found the lump that lead me to make sure there wasn't anything wrong. I ended up having a mammogram and ultrasound to lead to the diagnoses and being verified by a vacuum needle biopsy. I was surprised because the Radiologist Doctor said that it was definitely cancer. I think my jaw dropped to the ground once he showed me this monster on ultrasound. I had to ask twice if he was sure and sure enough he was right. I was scared and felt alone. Although, I have full support from my husband and family. I have remained faithful and God and that everything will be okay. I am a stronger person now.  It has already been a long journey and will continue to be. Having fear of other cancer in my body or it spreading. I am taking a anti hormone pill to kill any cancer that is left behind. I was supposed to have Chemo but, declined and I hope I made the right choice. Just fearful for the unknown."
