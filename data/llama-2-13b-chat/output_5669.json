        "Summarize the following story in first person: My family used to have a family reunion every year when I was a kid. Now an adult, my family is trying to hold annual reunions once again. It was my brother's idea so we decided to invite everyone to his house. We held the reunion over the summer 3 months ago. We set the date to fall on my dad's birthday just like we used to. I was surprised at how many and how far some of relatives drove to attend! My cousins all came and they're from the country and so have tons of kids. My own kids were finally able to meet some aunts and uncles of mine that they had never met before. While it took the adults a little time to warm up to each other, the kids were all laughing and playing together in no time. The food was provided by potluck. My brother's wife is amazing cook and supplied some of the best dishes. Together with her contribution and all of the food brought in, there was a real feast! We ate outside for the most part even though it was one of the hottest days of the summer. When everyone was full, we played games in the backyard. I got to catch up with one of the cousins I was closest to growing up. It was so nice to finally meet her husband and their two small children. We've been in touch since. My brother and I are already planning our next reunion!"
