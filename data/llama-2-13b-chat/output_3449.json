        "Summarize the following story in first person: Dear Diary,  I will never forget the day that I married my best friend.  We have been together for almost 16 years.  We finally got married in February of this year.  We always thought we would wait until we could afford a big wedding.  This year, we realized that it was just more important to us to be married.  We had a small wedding, with just the two of us.  It wasn't the most romantic thing in the world and I did not get to wear a dress.  But I was and still am perfectly ok with that.  It was us, together, and that is all that will ever matter.  Knowing that I can call him husband, makes butterflies flit inside my stomach even now.  It has been a very long, challenging road for us.  Standing across from him and saying those two simple words, I do, had such a huge impact on me.  I never realized what such a small thing as marriage would make me feel.  It's always been something that was just a piece of paper to me.  But standing before someone else and promising to love and cherish him forever, it felt good.  It felt like we were finally reaching a point where we could move forward, into a bright and happy future together."
