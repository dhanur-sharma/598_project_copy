        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was a long day. It was supposed to be my eldest son's birthday. Also, my brother was getting married and my youngest child was the flower girl in the wedding. I knew the day before that I was not going to be at that wedding. My contractions had started on Friday. I was just wanting to make it through the day. I really did not want to have a baby that day. There was too much going on. By two o'clock, it was obvious I needed to get to the hospital soon. But I had to wait for my mother in law to arrive. She was coming to help look after my children and take them to my brother's wedding.  I was trying to pretend that my contractions weren't that strong. I had to get my daughter dressed and ready. She was going to be in a wedding. Finally, my mother in law arrived. I don't know what we would have done that day without their help.  My husband and I went straight to the hospital. By the time we arrived it was five thirty. Now, I wanted to keep this little baby in until the next day because today was my eldest son's birthday. I really did not want them to share a birthday. Finally at 12:15 am, he made his arrival. My mother and sister came over just in time to meet him, straight from my brother's wedding reception. They showed me photos of my kids and shared the stories from the day. I was so grateful that I had such a wonderful family. I was overwhelmed with love and satisfaction."
