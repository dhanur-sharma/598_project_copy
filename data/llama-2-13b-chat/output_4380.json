        "Summarize the following story in first person: I love my daughter-in-law, she has been really good to my son. So I decided to throw a \"traditional\" surprise birthday party for her--about three weeks ago. Most of our immediate family was invited, and some of her close friends, and immediate family was invited as well. My son was tasked with keeping her occupied all day, until it was time to party. I called him that afternoon to drop her off. We all in hid in excitement, anticipating her shocked face. We heard the car pulling up, turned the lights off, and quickly hid. When the door opened, we turned on the lights, and yelled \"Suprised\". She was elated. She was happy to see all of us. I guess I did something right. The party was great! I had prepared some of her favorite foods. I even her favorite chocolate cake from the local bakery. That cake was gone by the end of the party. She even commented on the colorful decorations--it was her favorite color. Different shades of blue mixed in with white, and other bright colors. She just loved the food and the ambience of the entire event. She had fun chatting and dancing with those she hold dear. Well, I relationship has become even more stronger after throwing the party. My daughter-in-law is letting down her guard more and more each day. Matter of fact we spent some time alone shopping and eating at the local mall. We got to know each other a bit more. I love this woman, and hope our relationship can become even stronger."
