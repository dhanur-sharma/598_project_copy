        "Summarize the following story in first person: The most memorable event in the last few months was celebrating our 20th anniversary. Our children are getting a bit older so my husband and I decided to have a nice dinner out. We planned to go to a rather upscale Italian restaurant not too far. We have been there once for my birthday that is in January. So we dressed up nice and got ready. Got into the car and drove to the restaurant. The parking lot was strangely empty. I began to have doubts. Then my husband spotted a sign on the door. The restaurant was closed for summer. Apparently, they close down for 3 months every summer. Well that must be nice! However, Google does not have that noted so I was not alerted when I looked up the restaurant. My husband and I have been together for so long and have been through so much together that something little like this could not phase us. We had a good lough and got back into the car. My husband knows me all too well so he know right away where to take me. He drove us to a Japanese steakhouse. We had a wonderful time, drank some nice sake and had amazing steak along with a great cooking show. The restaurant even gave us a free anniversary desert. We had a great time and strengthened our bond."
