        "Summarize the following story in first person: A couple months ago, I went to a comedy show to see my boyfriend and 2 other friends in a comedy show. Before the show started, a group of drunk middle aged people wearing \"fun hats\" came in and asked for discounts on tickets. My friend who was producing the show foresaw them becoming a problem, and warned them that they had to remain respectful and not disrupt the show. Once the show started, they started getting loud, heckling the comedians, have loud conversations amongst themselves, and interrupting the show over and over. My friends on stage were struggling to keep the show going and not lose the audience by being too hard on them. I was finally fed up and yelled out for them to shut up. This caused a chain reaction where other frustrated audience members started yelling at them, confrontations between other audience members and them, some of the other comedians trying to hget them to leave and then finally the show runner came to ask them to leave. The main ringleader was wearing a pirate hat and refused to go after his friends did. He would start feigning falling over into the chairs when my friend touched his arm, and getting in front of the stage and shouting so that no one could move on. Finally the show runner had enough and have him some money back so that he would leave. The show went on, but the energy of the room had changed, and no one did particularly well after that. I was so frustrated for my friends, who's set's were ruined, and my friend the show runner who I was worried had lost money since he had to return so many ticket prices for the group of hecklers. The selfishness and audacity of the group was infuriating. Later in the night however I got 2 pieces of information. First, the show runner gave them some singles instead of the full cost of the singles and they were too drunk to notice. And second, that a drunk man in the pirate hat, was spotted getting a sobriety check by the police on the side of the road not far away from the comedy show. There is no way that he was sober enough to have passed."
