        "Summarize the following story in first person: Approximately 3-4 months I sustained an injury by falling out of bed. The type of bed that it was, a futon made of metal bars, pinned me against the wall. Thankfully, my husband was home as I was not able to move the bed off of me myself. I screamed for him to come into the room and he quickly moved the heavy bar off of me. Initially, there was a good amount of pain however, thankfully, it seemed as if my arm wasn't broken. After a day or two a huge bruise formed which covered half of my upper arm. The bruise was huge but, at that point it wasn't as painful as it looked. I cared for arm by icing for the first week. After about the first week a hematoma started to form. Within 3 days it was larger than the size of a baseball. At that point it was very painful - it felt as if there was nerve damage. The pain increased as the size increased. I went to the Emergency Room twice during that period of time. Xrays, ultrasound and an MRI were done to rule out a break, blood pooling or infection. Everything checked out and I was told that it would take time for the hematoma to dissolve and patience would be needed. A third trip to the ER in July included being admitted to the hospital for observation. At that point an infection needed to be ruled out. Surgery was being talked about to drain the blood. In the end the surgeon decided that it wasn't absolutely necessary to drain it but he could do it if I decided that this was what I wanted. I decided to pass on the surgery and to continue to allow it to naturally dissipate. As it was very painful, I continued to ice it and wrap it with an Ace bandage. Currently, it's the size of a golf ball and is still painful but it's definitely healing on it's own."
