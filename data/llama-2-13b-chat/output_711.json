We can't even get it to play old games like Diablo 2. It has been frustrating my sister for a long time. She decided to buy a new laptop through a program her work has. The take the payments right out of her paycheck. She likes the new laptop a lot. It has a touch screen and it can play all of the games she likes. It also has a very fast network card so it connects to the internet very fast. This is good for Netflix and Hulu. She watches a lot of that. I'm worried that the laptop is kind of expensive. I think it's ,more than she can afford. It's not my decision , though."
