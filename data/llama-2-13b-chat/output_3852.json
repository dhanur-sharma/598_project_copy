        "Summarize the following story in first person: From late March through mid-July, I visited many NYC art galleries in the Chelsea area and in the Madison Avenue Upper East Side gallery district.  I met many interesting managers, owners and employees in many of them, but the most memorable to me was with a man who was Sales Director at first, and is now one of the owners of a gallery in Chelsea.  I went to his gallery 5 or 6 times, but it was not only because I liked the painters he represented, but because I enjoyed talking and playing nice and sophisticated verbal 'games' with him.  He was very engaging as I talked to him about recommending some of one of his artists'  paintings to my sister, a collector, but even before that e discussed ballet because of one of the paintings that included a ballet  dancer, about which I am very knowledgeable.  He is not quite a close friend yet, but I was very impressed with his graceful technique, which most with the purpose of selling do not do nearly that well, so it looks like it will be something to look forward to in the coming months and years since I live close by and can go there often. Once there were some poster-type paintings, one of which included the George Bernard Shaw quote \"If you say something cannot be done, do not interrupt those who are doing it\".  I told him about how funny I thought it was, and this was a kind of teasing that he responded to, understanding me completely.  That was the second time I went to that gallery, mostly to see what had changed from coming early.  He is a very experienced gallerist, and always patiently took time with the two artists I settled on, the two who interested me and who interested my sister, who is a collector.  I found out she was interested in these works from an attachment he sent me, there were two abstract painters from which she might still choose to have in her home in Georgia.  He then extended the invitation to me and her alike to visit the favourite painter's studio in New Jersey when she is ready for purchase.  She comes to town once or twice a year, so she was excited that we would be able to do this.  She has outlined her preference in colour to narrow it down for what works best in her home.  I stay in touch with him about this eventuality, which may not happen due to family health problems till spring, but I also just go over and visit with him to see what new work he is showing and talk to him about art in general.  It's a good physical exercise (the gallery is a little over a mile walk for me), and he is always funny and generous about giving me more information on the artists. So we may actually become real friends over the next few months.  I enjoyed meeting someone by chance like this whom I truly liked."
