        "Summarize the following story in first person: About four months ago, my daughter moved seven hours away from us.   As the baby of the family, she is the first to actually move to a different town or city, let alone 7 hours away.  The only good thing about her moving so far is that she will be only one hour away from my mom.  It makes me feel better that if anything happens my mom will be right there until I can be.  I took it really hard, of course, and haven't been quite myself these past few months without her here.  She was not only my best friend, but she was always here to make sure I take care of myself.  She would do little things for me when I worked all day, like clean the house, have dinner ready, and put a scentsy on so the house smelled good when I got home.  We talked all the time about absolutely everything, and all of a sudden she was not here and I was extremely depressed.  My husband and I had drifted apart and hadn't even realized it.  Last week, I found out that my son is moving as well!  Both children leaving in one year!  In fact, he will be almost in the same town, and I told him when his father and I are not getting along, I am going to bring his dad to his house and drop him off!  Only jokingly, of course!   My husband and I have been talking about being alone again and although we miss our children, we have an opportunity to get to know each other again, and perhaps even fall in love all over again.  We are very excited, and have been communicating more and are even starting to flirt again!  We will see what happens!"
