        "Summarize the following story in first person: I don't understand what she is thinking. She broke up with me and humiliated me in front of all of our friends! Who ends a 2 year relationship while out with a bunch of mutual friends having fun? She wasn't ready to settle down? After two years? She's crazy! She expects me to just keep rolling over for her? It's been a month, and I've finally accepted it - I'm done. I should probably just block her number and block on her Facebook, maybe that will prove to her that I'm really not interested. Tonight I ran in to Cindy while Brad and I were out getting a drink after work. I've already been avoiding all of her texts and messages, but then she saw me and couldn't help herself I guess. She came over and told me, in front of Brad (she's apparently getting more comfortable embarrassing people in front of friends), that I had hurt her feelings. I hurt HER feelings by not contacting her back? I haven't done anything but protect my own feelings and I'm done. She's blocked, hopefully she gets the picture."
