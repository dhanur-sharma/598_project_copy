        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was the birthday of a family member. I had prepared for it by gathering items necessary for the party. I had bought candles, a cake, lights, balloons, and other miscellaneous supplies necessary for celebrating their birthday. I prepared for the birthday party by first unpacking the supplies and then preparing the table. I then unpacked the cake and placed it on the table. I spent some time setting up the remainder of the supplies, preparing our house for the party. When my family member saw the cake, they were elated. It was a nice setup. Soon we lit the candles. There were many candles on the cake, because they looked good on the type of cake that I had bought. We lit the candles, and soon the candles erupted into a large flame. The flames had joined each other into sort of a bonfire like appearance. It was funny but somewhat dangerous. My family member had to blow them out quickly before the whole cake burned up! My family enjoyed the party."
