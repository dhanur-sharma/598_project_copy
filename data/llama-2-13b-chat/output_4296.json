        "Summarize the following story in first person: Dear Diary, I was just sitting here thinking about the time I split my pants and a car passed by. It happened about Five months ago. I guess I should have paid way more attention to the pants I chose that day because the ones I was wearing were way too tight. So anyways; I'm walking at a pretty fast paced; which may have also influenced the ripping of my pants. My phone started to ring. I pulled my phone out of my pocket and with it came a 20 dollar bill. I didn't want to lose my money so I bent down and went to go pick up the money. It was a little windy, so it kind of flew away just a bit. I chased it. Finally, it landed on the sidewalk again and I bent down to pick it up. Right as I did, my pants ripped clean from the bottom to the top of the crotch area. That's not all! To make matters even worse, not only was I on a crowded street, but the way I was bent over made my bottom face towards the highway and a car drove by and saw my underwear; which just happened to be the worst of what I have in my underwear drawer. Talk about embarassing! Anyways, I ran right home and changed into looser pants and continued with my day. Guess nothing gets me too down, does it Diary?"
