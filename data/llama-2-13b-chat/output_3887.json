I have a history of auto-immune disorders in my family but this seems to be worse than what my other family members suffer with.  They have disorders as mild as eczema, and as severe as Crohn's Disease.  Until eight months ago, when I was diagnosed with this disease.  My life has changed dramatically.  It began with headaches that were very severe and for a while I assumed I was having migraines.  Then defective brain activity began to come into play.

I also have a disconnected feeling to reality when interacting in my day to day life.  It has caused me to leave me job and rely on disability checks.  My pride almost can't handle it.  I used to be very self-reliable and don't like being the recipient of charity.  The past eight months I have had to make many adjustments to the physical aspects of my life, along with mental."
