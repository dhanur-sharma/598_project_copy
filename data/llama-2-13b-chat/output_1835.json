        "Summarize the following story in first person: The last several months have been rough for work. There are more ups and downs than I would have expected because the work in based on various school schedules. I went from making $250 a week to $150 than back to $300 and last week a massive $45 for the full week. This is a major problem because my bills depend on this money. My bank was overdrawn by $98 today and my credit score dropped almost 100 points in the last 3 months because of the debt accrued by things that needed to go on the credit card. Even typing this out makes me anxious and uncomfortable because I don't know what to do. I have a side gig that is equally slow as it is based on a European holiday schedule. I've tried selling my knitted wares on Etsy, but the market is saturated. I've applied to work from home jobs at so many sites and none of them are interested in me because the only job I've had IS this type of online work that doesn't offer someone for them to call for a referral. When your 18 year old cousin, who never worked a day, gets hired by UHaul work from home but you, who graduated college but then got stuck being a housewife for 17 years, well... it is demoralizing. The up times of work are great, and if I could maintain those $250-$300 weeks, it would be awesome. But the fact of the matter is, those weeks are LONG. I'm not working 8 hours a day 5 days a week. I'm working 14 hours a day 7 days a week. I need some kind of balance, but I can't leave the house to work. So, the pride I had before? It took a beating."
