        "Summarize the following story in first person: I went out with friends and family to a park that had just opened up in our area. I thought that was a very nice park personally because everything was set up good. It was in a good location as well and everyone around us just really seemed to be in a positive mood and good spirits and I appreciated that so much. I thought that it was something I could really get into during my time there. My family was also pleasantly surprised in how well everything was going since we usually never take time out like that as a family to spend quality time with each other. Everything from my point of view was going absolutely perfect and nothing could ruin the day. We took time to take fun and exciting photo's, go see different things throughout the park and also meet up with other family members who were out there and connect with them. Needless to say this to me was really just what I would call a perfect day personally. I even got to eat some cotton candy, which honestly I never had cotton candy before so I was actually more pumped than I probably should have been when I was eating it, I never realized how good it was. Definitely a highlight for me throughout the experience along with that my family took a boat ride. The boat ride was really nice and relaxing especially because we all just seemed to be in good spirits throughout the trip and the ride just made everything even better. I never knew that spending time with your family like that could create such a nice environment. It was just very nice, the energy and vibes everyone gave off and the laughter we had, you just couldn't top that. I was so happy with how everything turned out I was even suggesting that we do it again some day. I think my family actually agreed that we should give that at least one more shot."
