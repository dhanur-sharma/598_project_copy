        "Summarize the following story in first person: I went to see Andrew Yang. it was so cool. I am so stupid and impressionable that I thought it would be a good idea to check him out. I love his UBI policy because again, I'm incredibly stupid and I don't understand how the economy works. Someone told me that UBI is bad because it'll just get sucked up by inflated rent and prices on goods. They also told me that it is just a way to chip away at the welfare state because it doesn't stack onto welfare benefits. I was just like 'dude, what? I'm not some kind of nerd. Yang gang baby!\"So anyway, I'm at this Yang rally, thinking about how I was dropped on my head as a kid, and Yang said something about math and how he's Chinese so me and my white frat bro friends laughed and started clapping. I'm still not sure what he said or why everyone laughed and clapped, but I don't want my friends to know how stupid I am. I love Yang's policies because he doesn't think there should be free education options. I like that idea because who needs free education, you know? The rally was a lot of fun but I started to get confused by all the big words like 'universal' and 'politician' so I was getting anxious to go home and watch the football game and get drunk with my bros. So yeah, the rally was cool, but I'm incredibly stupid so I wouldn't take my word on it. Yang GANG BABY!! I hope he wins!"
