        "Summarize the following story in first person: In the past few months I had a very memorable experience in winning my first election. Even though the event was sudden, the process was long and intense. I am very proud of my accomplishment and where I have come. The event that I am describing is my first direct experience being a political candidate in a local election. I experienced all sections of the process from getting my name on the ballot, to fundraising, to strategy, etc. While there were many memorable parts in retrospective thinking, the most memorable part was when we figured out I was the first in my political party to hold the particular office when I was elected, the first female in history and the youngest to ever be elected to the position. This is significant to me because of the struggles to prove myself to my community and my generation. There were a lot of uphill battles to prove my work ethic and my desire to serve. I am reminded daily of this event by going to work and continuing my service to my constituents. I am constantly reminded by the hurdles I overcame by being a single female on the ballot. The reminders of election night, and my father swearing my in and my first day in office will forever be a part of my memory. Daily I am faced with new found struggles. Those struggles remind me of what I went through and why I went through it. This milestone in my life has promoted me to be a better citizen and person. I will forever be grateful for this experience that many people will never have."
