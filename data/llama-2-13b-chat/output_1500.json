        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 5 months ago I was struggling. I wasn't eating well. I wasn't sleeping well. I just couldn't function like I knew I was supposed to. Something had to be done, and I didn't know where to start. My life felt like it was going downhill fast and there was nothing that I could do to stop it. I got help from a friend and he suggested that I really need to just watch what I eat and try to get on a set sleep schedule. I knew that those were some of my problems, and I wanted to fix them all, so if that was the start then I'd try. It went well and I could tell that sleeping better and more regularly was a big help. I started to feel healthier and things became less of a struggle. I started being motivated to live and wake up. I wanted to keep improving. I was trying so hard now because I could see improvements. I could tell I was making progress both physically and mentally. I just kept at it and kept pushing my goal further and further so Id keep at it."
