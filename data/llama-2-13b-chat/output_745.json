        "Summarize the following story in first person: My girlfriend got angry at me because I didn't respond to a message she sent fast enough. She proceeded to spam me on several accounts. Rather than dignifying her behavior with a response, I ignored her. The following day she got angry at me for acting differently towards her. The most significant and telling part of this entire ordeal was who she chose to attribute the blame to. She blamed me for not responding to their manipulative behavior. Then blamed me for making her feel bad the next day. Annoyed, I readily pointed this out. I told her that in all their pestering yesterday and angry rambling today she didn't once consider how I might feel. Surprisingly this took her aback. She apologized and started to reign in their behavior when it became apparent she was wrong. In the end what could have been a worse day wasn't.Since then she has been trying her best to stay calm. She has had her moments, but she has managed to regain her composure. I can see that she is trying her best."
