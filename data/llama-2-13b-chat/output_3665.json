There were very few buses plying today as most of them had been put on election duty. I waited for two hours at the bus-stop to get into the bus. It was much crowded. I somehow managed to get some space for myself. It was really difficult to breathe. Everyone was sweating. People were pushing each other. After journey of two hours, I came out of the bus and took a sigh of relief and they will likely. I\u2019ll never forget this journey in my life. and i will achieve more awards and more the popularity Due to the complications at birth, the doctors said that I had less chances of surviving; as I was losing my blood pressure at a faster rate. Despite all the odds, without being kept in the incubator, I made it by just clinging onto my mom and absorbing her body heat. I was not kept in the incubator; as the only available incubator in the hospital was not working. My mom had her labor pain at an unexpected time and had to get admitted in a rural hospital with less facilities."

The nurses gave me a small toy to keep me calm and they also gave my mom some medicines to ease her labor pain. I was born after 24 hours of labor pain and the doctors said that I was too weak to survive. But my mom did not give up and kept me close to her heart. She breastfed me and took good care of me. She did not let me cry or feel hungry. I was a preemie baby and I had to stay in the NICU for a month. My mom used to visit me every day and talk to me. She would sing me lullabies and tell me stories. She would also bring me toys and clothes. I slowly started gaining weight and my health improved. I was discharged from the hospital after a month. My mom was happy to see me back home and she thanked the doctors and nurses for taking good care of me. I am now six years old and I am in first grade. I am doing well in my studies and I love to play with"
