        "Summarize the following story in first person: Earlier this year, I had two medical emergency, I was hospitalized for a bowl blockage, and had to have emergency surgery. Three inches of my small intestines was removed, I almost died because i aspirated on blood from the NG tube (nasogastric tube), that was place prior to surgery tore my sinus cavity and my throat causing the blood to run into my lungs. I remember waking up after surgery I knew something was wrong, I could look around, but I could couldn't talk, i couldn't control my body. The nurses came in to run my stats. Seeing that my oxygen level was at 72, they called rapid response. My surgeon wanted me on the ventilator but I begged no to be. The Doctor and Respiratory therapist had talked and decided to try something experimental  and but me on a new Device called the Air Bow, which saved my life. After one week in the intensive care unit and one week in a regular room, I was able to go home. The doctor and the nurses called me a miracle, because 70% of people that make it into a situation like mine do not make it.  Then exactly a moth later I woke up in so much pain and was taken to the emergency room by ambulance. As it turned out i had perforated an ulcer and looking at emergency surgery again, but luckily I had a smart surgeon that has good instincts. I was able to avoid surgery again with self healing, I went home after another week in the hospital.  As an effect of my Medical emergencies I know suffer from PTSD ( post traumatic stress disorder). Suffer from panic attacks when I go to sleep at night or when I have to go near a hospital. Currently I am seeing a therapist to work through my issues, so I can attempt to live a normal life."
