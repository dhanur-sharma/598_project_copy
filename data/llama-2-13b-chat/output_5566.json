        "Summarize the following story in first person: I don't know why I've waited so long to write this down. Maybe a part of me thought it was better to keep it all wrapped up in my head, as though putting it to paper would cheapen it in some way. Regardless of the reasons, the time is now. After a lifetime I saying i'd never been, about a million people telling me I should go and a few dozen times planning a trip I would never take I have finally done it.  12 months ago, I finally went to Disney World. Mind you, this was not entirely my choice. If it were up to me, I would have likely stopped short just after browsing the site and looking at the package costs. Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately depending on how you think about it, my wife was there this time. You see, our youngest daughter, Jane, was finally turning 18. The nest was about to be full blown empty for the first time in maybe thirty years! We couldn't simply let that go without some sort of send off. So we didn't. We called up the other kids, packed our bags and headed for California for one last big family trip. I can not believe it took me an entire lifetime to do this. I could go on about the themed rooms, the service of the staff or the rides...All of which were fantastic, but I wont. Because the truth is, I barely noticed them. While everyone else was laughing at goofy or hugging another full grown man in a Mickey Mouse costume, I was watching my family. The grin on Jane's face when we watched the fireworks show on night one... The excitement Trent displayed when he saw Space Mountain for the first time... The real vacation was in those looks. We spent three days over there before it was finally time to come home. Truth be told, a part of me never wanted to leave. However light hearted it was supposed to have been, we were a whole family for a few days and that was something that Trent's job, Maggie's wanderlust and my bum hip hadn't allowed for in a long time. Eventually we did come home though. We came home and Jane went off to her East Coast college. I'll never forget the last hurrah. The vacation of a lifetime that summed up a lifetime of familial achievement."
