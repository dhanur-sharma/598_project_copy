        "Summarize the following story in first person: I have been staying in my home for about four years now. I haven't had much problems in the years I have been here. Except a year ago when about 6-7 new families had came to live on the same street in which I have been staying. At first it wasn't much issues having that there was a decent amount of new people moved in the neighborhood. Eventually things started to brew and a there were potential issues coming along that could make the neighborhood better or worse. It was a situation in which if people came together to find a solution things could work out. That being said I wanted to get most of the new neighbors involved. It was a talll task to begin with but things clicked. Myself and couple neighbors I am close with were able to gather everyone. New neighbors change the tenor of a street. This was a usual quiet neighborhood but things did get a little more loud due to this issue. Our neighborhood had rallied against this potential threat. Everyone had built a bond in which we felt connected to each other. Maybe due to everyone being able to come together and figure a problem out. I feel even more welcome and accepted."
