        "Summarize the following story in first person: Two months ago I did it; I accomplished one of the hardest things I've ever attempted in my life. Last year I volunteered helping out for the marathon that runs through our city. Watching those runners, I felt inspired. I listened to their stories, and saw the sheer joy on their faces, despite the times they came in or how much their body hurt after. I thought to myself, I want to experience this first hand. However, I knew I'd have a ton of training to do because I hadn't run long distance in twenty years. I trained all year, even through the blistering cold of winter. I was determined and it was extremely difficult to stick with it, but I did manage to get into good enough shape to enter and complete the marathon. I can't say how many times I thought about quitting while I was in the marathon because I lost count. I reminded myself that I had gone all year training and never quit. I reminded myself that I had already did a practice run and did fairly well, without quitting. I knew I had prepared, and hydrated and gave my body its needed nutrition and rest. I was prepared, and there was no need to quit. I reminded myself how great it would feel to cross that finish line. Much to my surprise and my delight, I came in eighth place."
