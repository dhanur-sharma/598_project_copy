        "Summarize the following story in first person: Another day, another dollar, literally. I'm working to make every dollar I can just in case my boyfriend really gets fired from his vet job. I just can't believe that a dog could...die under his care. We were already worried about money but now this threat of his job loss and the break without pay hasn't helped at all. We've been saving cans and collecting any metal we can find. I even pick up every, single, penny I see anywhere. I've cleaning put the coach of coins as well. I've been trying to get my boyfriend onto uber, or doordash or something to the likes. I don't think there will be legal trouble. Most everyone is understanding that it was accident. Hopefully everything keeps going smoothly and he gets his job back. My boyfriend said he was going to get a little side work with his dad at construction until he gets his job back though, and refuses the gig jobs. His dad hasn't had any work for him yet so I keep pushing the idea but he just won't do it. I asked what happened with the dog and he just burst into tears. It must have been horrible, I can't imagine the guilt he feels, especially because he loves animals almost more than anything else in the world."
