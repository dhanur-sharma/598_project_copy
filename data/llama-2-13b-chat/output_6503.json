        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last semester was a full of blast. It does not get any crazier than just telling myself that I would one day get up in the morning and run to school and back for an entire semester. I did not tell my friends or post in social media what my plan was to save money for college. I did it because I thought it was the right thing to do to challenge myself and be more productive while I am not working. During the summer time, I have placed myself in a situation where I will be on a challenge. to get myself together act. Many of which had to do with my inability to communicate with people efficiently. I was sick of not being able to go anywhere in life. I did not have a car to take me anywhere. However, I see cars as a tool for transportation. It can be done without it. My plan was to do this until the semester ended. I had Two campuses to visit in order to follow lectures and taking tests. The journey began with a trip to the closest campus. It was six miles away. The following day followed with a trip that was eleven miles a way.  Both were doable for me but as time followed, my body was could not keep up with the work that was required to keep commuting on foot. There was many generous rides. I met new people and was able exchange phone numbers although I never called them back after the ride. Two months in and I had suffered enormous pain. I decided to take the bike for the longer commute and run as usual on the shorter route.  During the period in which I experienced the most pain, I decided to eat more of real food and avoid the junk. I also switched from sleeping on my bed to the direct floor as my back was always hurting from the weight of my bag. At the end of my semester, I did not learn anything. What I got out of it is meeting new people and going outside is a blast."
