        "Summarize the following story in first person: In May my whole family decided to celebrate my mom's birthday. A lot of may not know but she passed away two years ago and 13 days before her 48 birthday. Her birthday is May 26 she would have been 50. It was a very hot day so we all brought fans because we were outside. So we had this big cookout at my uncle's house.  We even listen to music and dance with each other which was her favorite. Then also we had burgers and hotdog and a lot of soul food which was the best. We did a tribute to in the front yard were we did a prayer and release balloons. After we finish that we all sat around some of us got little emotional. Then the cake came out that my aunt got made which had her picture on it. Then we all ate and catch up while the kids played. It's like a full playground at my uncle's house. He has playset, sandbox, four wheeler pool and more. When it was all over we help clean up and  I went home with my son and watch some movies.  I decided to drink a little bit because I was in my feeling about my mom. It's hard losing someone that you been with your whole life so it's a struggle."
