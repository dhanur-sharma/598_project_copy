        "Summarize the following story in first person: A month ago something really big happened in my life. This event was the death of my almost 1 month old nephew. I was just sitting around looking at my Facebook when I saw a post from my sister-in-law about my nephew being at the hospital. I immediately freaked out because he is to young to be there and something must be wrong. Well then my husband messaged her and all she said was that he was dead and that he died in his sleep. She gave us no explanation other than that. Well, then my husband and I went down to her place to see her but she was gone holding her son for the last time she ever would at the hospital. When she got back and was done talking to the police you could tell that it was hitting her hard and she still has not gotten over this. The funeral was so sad because you could see him just laying there. My mother-in-law even broke down more than her daughter. This has been a huge event in my life. I never ever expected something like this to happen to someone I know so personally. It has also got me watching my son closer. I am much more paranoid that something bad is going to happen to him. I am now more aware that bad things can and will happen at anytime and I need to be more observant."
