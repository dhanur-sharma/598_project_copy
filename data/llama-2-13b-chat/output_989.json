        "Summarize the following story in first person: Going home from the bank is usually a mundane, uneventful occurrence. Three months ago, however, it was anything but. I rode my bike to the bank in order to deposit a check. That in itself went smoothly. While cycling back home to the bank, however, my route so happened to weave through a path where rowdy kids were playing. I did not plan ahead and did not think of an alternative route to cycle through, so I had no choice but to go past them. They partook in a match of paintball. As they were playing, I got hit in the shoulder by one of the paintball capsules. I was super mad at the children, and was tempted to yell at them. I just wanted to get home above all, though, so instead of adding to the conflict I instead made sure to bike much faster until I knew for sure I was completely out of the kids sights. During the rest of my ride, my mind had two focuses. One was getting home, the other was how annoyed I was at it happening to me. I showered just before going to the bank, and now I'll have to shower again! But it could've been worse. At the very least, I wasn't hurt that badly. I was not knocked off my bike, which spared me from potential worse injuries. Since this happened, I've made sure to have multiple cycling routes to prevent something like this from happening again."
