        "Summarize the following story in first person: On August 19, 2019, I went to see my new neurologist concerning my MS. I have had MS for many years but over the last 10 years or so, I moved from relapsing remitting to secondary progressive. I have been having a lot of problems with falling and stumbling and the fatigue has been horrible. To further complicate the issue I fell on April 2nd this year and tore up my knee, which exacerbated the MS. I started back to work the first day of school, August 14th. I substitute in high needs SPED. I knew I wasn't doing well with my MS, but it came as a complete shock to me when my doctor told me I was \"running out of reserves/ basically about out of reserves\" and I need to conserve my energy NOW. She said I should not be working, which I love my students, but she understood why I continued. Now, I am having to cut back my days at school and have accepted the fact that this year will be last year of teaching, I want to use my energy for doing the other things I love, which is travelling. I am going to Italy in September and will have to go on a rollator/wheelchair. I am devastated, I have been bursting into tears, even at school, I am having problems coping with this new news. It's almost like when I was first diagnosed, but worse now because of my age. I have always \"pushed through\" and tried to exercise my legs. I have been told I should really STOP now to reserve whatever I have left. I am using my walker at home now, so that is helping with my falling. However, because I used to be paralyzed from my waist down and spent years on my scooter, I do not want to have to use a scooter again. I donated both of mine. I also had hand controls in my vehicle, which I am afraid I might have to do again. I am okay with that aid. I simply feel like I am going backwards, even though I have known for the 34 years I've had MS it is a progressive disease. Now that my husband is retired and we can do things, it is so difficult for me, though I thoroughly enjoy travelling This new news about my MS has been emotionally and mentally exhausting."
