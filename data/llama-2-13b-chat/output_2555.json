        "Summarize the following story in first person: It doesn't feel real, but I suppose writing about it will help me get through this eventually. It doesn't seem like it's already been three weeks. The worse part is that I know I'm not the one feeling the most pain. I guess I need to actually say it. John passed away. It's one thing if someone is sick for a long time. You see them suffering and you want their pain to end. But for someone to die suddenly and be ripped from your family with no warning, nothing can prepare you for that. I know accidents happen all the time. Literally every day, probably every hour, someone dies on the road. It happens to other families and they must feel like mine does. You just never imagine it would happen to your loved ones. John was such a pleasure to be around. When my sister fell for him, I knew he was the right guy. He's been a good buddy to me and a great uncle to my son. Telling my son was probably the hardest part for me personally. Jimmy loved John so much. He's just old enough to sort of understand what happened and it absolutely breaks my heart. Now, that was hard for me, I am currently sobbing thinking about Erica. My sister loved him with every ounce of her being. They wanted kids. They wanted adventure. They deserved it all and now? None of us can imagine life without him, but he was her literal other half. It's just too much."
