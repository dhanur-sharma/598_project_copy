        "Summarize the following story in first person: My father passed away two weeks ago and he came to visit in my dreams last week. You see, I had not seen my father for 2 years before he died because of very hectic lives on both our parts. When I was a little girl, I was very spiritual and was having a conversation with my dad about life after death. He was not a believer but told me that when he died he would come visit me to confirm it's realness if it was so. Fast forward to adulthood again, and about 1 month before he died we were talking on the phone and he stated that we have to see each other soon. He was afraid that he did not have much time left here. He needed to see his baby girl quickly. He soon passed but came to me my dreams dressed in white. He was smiling broadly, and around 30 years old. He had no eyes because what replaced them was wisp of spirit I could see clearly in them I knew he was fulfilling his promise to me when I was a little girl. This has reaffirmed my spirituality and faith. I am forever happy to have had him here. The experience has made me stronger. The be experience has made me love more. The experience has made me more optimistic."
