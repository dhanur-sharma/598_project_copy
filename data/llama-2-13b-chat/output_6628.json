        "Summarize the following story in first person: I had to give a message at my father's service.  I could barely get through it.  I had so many emotions going through me that I was miserable.  I was embarrassed because I could hardly talk.  I kept thinking about him being gone when I was talking.  I don't think that anyone understood what I said.  I was hoping to be able to give a great tribute to my dad, but I clearly did not.  I wanted it to be over, i was uncomfortable enough already with his death and now I was making a fool of myself.  It was hard enough to be without a dad, I just should have let someone else do it.  I am still mad at myself for trying to speak, I should have know that I couldn't do it.  I am still grieving and my heart is still broken from my loss.  I hope that time will heal this wound.  I am constantly thinking about this, and I know it is having an effect on my every day life.   I try to move on from it and I can't.  I wonder what me being like this is doing to my family."
