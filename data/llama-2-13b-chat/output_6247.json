        "Summarize the following story in first person: I remember this took place on a particularly drab week. I was living with my girlfriend... Depression was  slowly building from boredom too. Eventually I thought, \"fuck it I gotta see how the avengers ends\". I hopped into the car (without my lame girlfriend) and it turned out to be a really nice day. Cloudless, extrememly bright too. Lot's of people were walking around downtown. I decided to join them after watching half of the movie. This is when I was approached by an elated bald man who thought I was the singer for the Sexdolls (at the show nearby or something). We ended up having a highlightable but completely worthless conversation for me. It was nice to talk to someone in a good mood. The man could not fathom that I wasn't the singer, either. I must have looked a lot like a Sexdoll. HA. We talked back and forth a minute too. But it was such a relieving day being in the sun. Still one of my best memories."
