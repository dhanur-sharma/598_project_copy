        "Summarize the following story in first person: So I'm a manager at the the sober living halfway house here in town. I've been the manager here for many years. As you can imagine there are a lot of different characters that come and go. And seeing as how we can't discriminate about 2 months ago I had the worst fucking person to deal with yet. I had no choice but to accept him. The guy was struggling with addiction and also had an array of mental health issues. They were only made worse by the amount of drugs he was taking. He was IV using methamphetamines. I don't know how much experience you have with people who use that stuff. But let me tell you it's no fun. Even once they get sober the effects are still present for some time afterwards, some effects end up being life long. He caused trouble with the other residents. Others say that they thought he was high and was causing drama. However we have a tight budget and he is drug tested every 5 days. He had never failed a test. So it was hard to just kick him out. Well, I let the owner of the home know we had some complaints. And some suspicions about him. So, figuring that he would get high for 2 days and then not use for 3 days to get his urine clean for her test or using fake pee whatever he was doing, we set him up. He allowed for me to use the following weeks test the day after the first test and we had him pee in front of me. And wouldn't you know it he was lying to all of us but more importantly himself. He burned a hole in that cup he was dirty for METH!! Back to jail you go bro, and I hope you all the best in the future, but stay the hell away from here."
