        "Summarize the following story in first person: At the time I was working with Corporate Vestus Enterprises. I was working a lot of hours and flying around all over the place. Now obviously, this can often come at odds with family and friend matters, it becomes increasingly difficult to have a personal life with people other than co-workers. Anyways, so yet again I was seeing some issues regarding my business schedule and how I could make time for family. I felt really bad, prior to working for this company my niece and I were extremely close. In fact, I practically raised her myself when her parents were not around to handle matters (things were pretty tight with them so they had to work a lot). I finally had made up my mind and firmly resolved I could not miss this. So I spoke with some of my co-workers and really, REALLY had to twist their arms about it. I didn't want to bring it up with upper-management because I knew they would react with cold disregard. In this company, your company is your personal life and if you aren't cut out for this, the door is right there. So I convinced my co-workers to cover this one project for me, it was not easy. I had to really sweeten the deal, I told each of them I would cover twice as many projects for them (if and when they needed it). I added in that whatever projected time off they had, I would take a lot of the paper work-load off their hands for them (we never REALLY get a vacation). My niece was overjoyed to see me and honestly, just that look on her face would've been worth 5X what I offered my coworkers. We celebrated not just that weekend but the following week as well. That girl is my life, I'll never be able to pass up an opportunity to be in her life again. Maybe it's time to find a new line of work.."
