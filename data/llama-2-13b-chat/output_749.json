        "Summarize the following story in first person: A memorable moment was recently when I hosted a birthday party for my boyfriend. We rented out a hall and threw a party there. We recently moved to a different city so we have not seen our friends in a while. On his birthday we invited everybody down and had a good turn out. The theme of the party was more of a Hawaiian theme which everyone seemed to enjoy. There were lots of foods, drinks, music and games. Seeing everybody get together to celebrate this moment was special. There were also some unexpected gifts that he received. Our kids were also at this party and they put together a dance for their dads birthday. Our kids are young which makes this even cuter. To see his reaction to the dance was memorable. The smile on faces was such a positive feeling. Later on that night we ended up taken everybody back to our house. The hall was only rented out for a few hours and it went better then expected so we continued it at home. Some people spent the night since they could not drive back home. Waking up that next morning to a house full of people and laughs about the night before was also very memorable."
