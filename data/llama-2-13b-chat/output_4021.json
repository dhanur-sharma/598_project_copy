        "Summarize the following story in first person: Those most memorable event that I can think about that happened recently was the grieving process after my cousin died. My first couple was a healthy individual and one day we were hanging out and she randomly got sick and did not recover. The most surprising part about this was that she was completely healthy and had never had any sort of ailments before. I ended up dropping everything and went up to the funeral and it was very memorable because I saw my family that I haven't seen in so long. I saw the mother of the deceased and it had been so many years since i'd seen her and she still remembered me. It was important to me to actually be there because she had meant so much to me. We were extremely close in age and it really shocked me that she passed away without me being able to say goodbye. This selfish feeling, I did not like at all, I didn't like that I was thinking about me getting closure instead of the fact that my cousin passed away. It was very important to me to be able to say my final goodbyes to my cousin. I did not like seeing her in the casket that way because it was forcing me to accept that she was actually gone. It was really difficult for me to accept this and what made it even worse is when I sit at home and I have no one to snapchat. I remember we would send each other silly videos during the day. My sitting at home without those videos and without hearing her voice was an important moment that I realized that she was actually gone. Now that I reflect on the memories that she and I have made, I wish for more time, but it is entirely too late. There isn't anything I can do now except honor her legacy and let her kids know what a wonderful woman she was. I'll definitely miss her and will do everything I can to make sure she's remembered."
