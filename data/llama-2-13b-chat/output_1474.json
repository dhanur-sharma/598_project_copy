        "Summarize the following story in first person: My feelings about my retirement have changed over the last few months.  When I first retired, I felt like I was leaving my job under a cloud.  I had received a bad evaluation, and my decision to leave was prompted as much by this as it was by positive emotions.  As a result, I felt like I was leaving as a failure.  I worried that without work as a source of meaning, my life would become empty. I did struggle a bit with these feelings of failure and emptiness, but it didn't last long.  I quickly discovered that my family needed more attention than I had been giving, and that serving my family provided more meaning than work ever had.  I have two children in college, and they were both struggling emotionally.  My wife works far more than anyone should, and feels unable to leave her job.  Because of this, there was a hole in the emotional center of the family.  I have worked to fill this hole, with some success.  As described by one of my sons who has already left home, \"The family is back in balance.\"Looking back on my last day, I left with some trepidation.  I was in some ways unwilling to admit how nervous I was about this new life stage and new status.  I remember the sense of closure as I said my goodbyes, but what I didn't realize was that life would definitely go on, in new and better ways.  I might not see the people I was acquainted with at work any more, but I would get to know my family in new and deeper ways.  It may be a cliche, but it is true: it wasn't an end, it was a beginning."
