        "Summarize the following story in first person: If we had known, we would have listened to friends and moved house. A month ago, when there were warnings that people should leave the area because T.S. Imelda was coming, a cyclone that was predicted to hit our area in Texas, we thought the storm was minor. We were even unconcerned when it was reported in the media that the storm had been upgraded to a tropical storm. We thought that after Harvey, we were secure because we had carried out major constructions on our house. Then one morning, out of nowhere, our house was flooded. It was unbelievable. It took us unawares. There was no news about it happening that morning. We were practically unaware that that morning was going to be the worst in our entire lives. I woke my wife in bed and she screamed. It was a scary experience. The first thought that came to my mind was that this was extremely tough on us after Harvey. One month ago, we had a beautiful home but right now, we are struggling to keep it in good shape. We are presently staying with friends because the house is said to be in uninhabitable conditions. The insurance is coming on slowly and the process is tough not after Harvey. If we had foreseen this, we would have been more prepared for Tropical Storm Imelda."
