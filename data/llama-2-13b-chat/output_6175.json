        "Summarize the following story in first person: My dreams cam true a few days ago. I finally got to see John Mayer. I was literally crying tears of joy. I have been a big fan for the last ten years. I started to listen to his songs in college because my boyfriend and share a favorite. It was like he was signing to me except there were thousands of other people there. My boyfriend and I fought the crowd and found our seats just in time. The parking lot was jammed packed and almost made us late for the show. Anyways, once we got in our seats the lights flashed on and he came out with a guitar singing and started singing in the mic. There were a few slow songs in which people would hold up their lighters and wave them in the air. He played for a good 2 hours and even brought some special guests on stage. I was hoping we'd catch a peek after the show when he went to his tour bus. Once again the crowd was so thick we couldn't make it outside in time. The experience was overwhelming and I won't forget the pure joy I felt that day. I'm glad that I could share the moment with my hunny bunny even though I paid for the tickets. He did pay for supper and gas so that means something. I'm hoping we can catch him next year but after spending so much on tickets I might have to wait a few years."
