        "Summarize the following story in first person: I went to Vietnam for a long awaited vacation.  I had my passport and thought I had my visa in order but I got stopped at the airport when I got there.  The clerk didn't speak much English but luckily spoke French which I speak.  I was missing some form and they were very unhappy with me.  She finally got a superviser to come help me and after a lot of waiting around my passport was stamped.  I should have taken this as an omen.  The cab driver taking me to the hotel took a scenic route on purpose and charged me double what the rate was supposed to be.  By that point I was too tired to argue so I paid them.  The hotel was just okay but I wasn't expecting fancy for the bargain price.  I went to check out some local shops my second day there and people were so rude.  A salesperson followed me around one store like they expected me to shoplift.  I look a bus to the beach and when I got off I noticed a little girl looking lost on the sidewalk.  I asked if she was okay and she smiled and took my hand.  I let go and started to walk away looking for her parents and she followed me.  Just as I was wondering if I should find the police station her mother came running up and grabbed her.  I was glad that had a happy ending."
