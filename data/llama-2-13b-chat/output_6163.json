        "Summarize the following story in first person: I read so many horror stories about this job before I applied. My peers in the class told me, don't work in that hospital, they are so disorganized. They just hired a new department head, and he's an imbecile. The only reason the position is even open is because the person who had it before you quit on the spot one day out of frustration, not even giving their two weeks notice! But I needed this internship so badly. I have to intern somewhere as part of my graduation requirements, and this was the only place to even call me back. So I interviewed, I was hired, and I showed up to my first day extremely nervous. The first thing I noticed was my supervisor was not the person I was led to believe would be my supervisor. My stomach dropped, because here was even more evidence that this department is completely disorganized. But...she actually turned out to be the kindest, sweetest person ever! I am so lucky to have her as my boss. She took me under my wing from day one, telling me that us women have to stick together and support each other. She always answers my questions promptly, and encourages me to think outside the box (or outside the petri dish, I guess I should say.) When I don't notice something I should have noticed, she always gently shows me where I went wrong, so I won't make that mistake again. And yes, the department head is kind of hard on people, but it turns out he actually just expects a lot and if you work to meet his expectations, he isn't so bad either. The combination of support and high expectations have kept me on my toes and made me feel like I'm having an experience that is really growing my knowledge and skills over time."
