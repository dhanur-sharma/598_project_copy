        "Summarize the following story in first person: Today was a terrible day for me. My co-worker, who we will call the big \"W\" is usually always mean to me. However, today she was the worst. It was our big Christmas party, and she micromanaged everyone at work today. She started openly complaining about only she was smart, only she did any real work, etc. Everyone had told me since I started here how terrible she was and how badly they wanted her to be fired. Despite this, no one would ever do anything about her or talk about her until she left the room. Finally I snapped and decided not to sit down and take it like everyone else. While she started insisting she told me to do something I was never told, I told her to her face she never said that. She lost it and started to scream at me, while she did that my boss just ignored it like he usually did. I decided I had enough of a boss that wouldn't do anything and handed him my resignation, which was more than he deserved. He tried to convince me it was cowardly to leave, but I told him it was cowardly to not fire her. She kept harassing me through the night until that point, then my boss decided to take her to the back room and yell at her for having a coworker finally quit over her. She came back out and stayed quiet for the whole rest of the night. I left that job and felt good about leaving, they all already didn't like her but it was made worst once she actually cost them a good employee who at least tried their best which was more than half of the people they hired did."
