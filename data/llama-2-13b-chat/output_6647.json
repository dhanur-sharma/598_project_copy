        "Summarize the following story in first person: Starting October, the temperature finally dipped below 100. Taking advantage of less heat, my unruly neighbor decided to take up her woodworking activity on her apartment balcony again. Her balcony is situated next to my room desk and across from my front door where I work on my laptop. She moved in next door while still employed by the property. She began causing a ruckus by cursing, at her incredibly hyperactive child as well as her older stepchildren, as she banged, hammered, etc for months on end. It was taken in stride under the impression that she was working on remodeling the apartment in lieu of the usual maintenance crew. She eventually stopped when the summer heat became unbearable but still let her child screech, scream and climb all over the place while she looked at her phone in the evenings. She'd yell at him every 20 seconds or so instead of paying attention to him or taking him to the park across the street. When walking past her, she would ignore anyone coming across her. The noise was intolerable as she started up again. This time, she used heavy machinery from early morning into the evening. Her kid would just screech at the top of his lungs next to her. I started recording her extraordinary noise in audio files and video . I also began taking images of her woodpile, hidden from public view, but clearly visible from my front door. I messaged the property manager about her proximity and balcony violations but got no response. I called the front desk and they said the manager wasn't in. They said they couldn't do anything because they didn't have authority. Following day, same attempts and replies but nothing... third day, trying to get management to stop her, nothing. Eventually while she worked all day again, some other neighbor confronted her and she stopped... until he left, then started again. I called the corporate office overseeing  more than just this complex. No answer. Saturday rolled around, nothing, she was still at it ALL day. After some initial prejudice and trying to back me off, I quoted city ordinance statutes to the police and they came by to stop her. She lied and said she was unaware the noise was bothersome."
