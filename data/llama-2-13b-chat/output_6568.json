        "Summarize the following story in first person: I really do enjoy my job for the most part. This is due, in large part, to one person in particular. Since I started working at my current job a year ago, I have had a very close relationship with my boss. We get lunch together, talk about our personal lives, and she can answer any questions I have regarding professional work topics. The other day though, this was all turned on its head. My boss told me she would be turning in her two week notice. She told me she would be pursuing a higher paying opportunity. She said that she was very sorry, and that we would still keep in touch. I was completely devastated, and I am even considering leaving the company now. By staying here, I will miss her constantly. I have to forge my own path now and figure out these problems on my own. I was hoping that I would have the chance to work under her up until retirement, but that is not the case. She was an excellent boss in every sense of the word. I have developed so much working under her. I am so grateful for all that she did for me."
