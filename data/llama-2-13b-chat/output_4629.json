        "Summarize the following story in first person: Today was definitely not the best of days. After what seemed like forever but was really only a short period, my cat Stubbs has passed on. I had known that he was sick but had been giving him medicine to treat his kidney issues for a while and he had seemed stable. Then in the lead up to this, he stopped eating or drinking, had trouble even walking, and had a dull glassy look in his eyes. I took him to the vet in a panic whereupon he informed me that Stubbs red blood cell count was dangerously low and his kidneys had degraded even further. After spending a week under observation there being given fluids and medicine I was allowed to take him home, under orders to inject a saline solution into him every day which he understandably was not overly happy about (and the scars from the scratches and bites on my arms can attest to that), but it seemed to be working for several months. Then he just abruptly degraded again do it was back to the vet, they did the usual treatment and observation before letting me bring him home, but this time was different and I think we all knew it, but no one wanted to say that I was just taking him home so he could die in a place of comfort rather than a cage surrounded by people he didn't know. He was fine for a short while upon coming home seeming to have one last gasp of energy where he was friendly and playful, but the other cats could sense something was off and kept their distance.  All too soon he found himself unable to even stand and was forced to drag himself around the room on his side, even picking him up caused him to yowl in pain. The end was upon us that night, there was a loud screech from him in the middle of the night and by the time I had gotten out of bed and over to him he was already dead. It was heartbreaking to witness it, but at the least it wasn't drawn out forever with him in pain, and when the worst of it came he passed fairly quickly. Both I and my remaining cats were in a malaise for days, as they could tell he wasn't coming back this time. I had him cremated and then buried wrapped in his favorite blanket that he'd drag around everywhere. It was hard on me but I'm happy I was able to give an older (15) cat a new home to enjoy his remaining days rather than languishing at a shelter. It's going to make it all the harder to go through this another three times as my other cats get on in years though and I'm coming to dread every ailment that they suffer out of fear of it being the prelude to this happening again."
