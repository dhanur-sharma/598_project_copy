        "Summarize the following story in first person: When we dated, *Jacob talked only of himself. His job, his friends, his hobbies, general anecdotes from his life. He was not interested in hearing stories from my life. Even as they relate to a shared interest among the two of us. We both enjoy hiking. He frequently retold stories of his endeavors, especially in public settings. He spoke loudly, and always pulled up the same photo on his phone. I don't believe in being rude, especially to a person I'm partnered with. So I reacted with intrigue. Finding new things to point out. On a particular occasion, I wanted to show him a photo of a solo mountain hike I recently completed. He was not interested. At that point, I began to realize something wasn't right. After all, why are my experiences any less interesting than his? Why can't he show me the same courteous listening I show him? This is where I decided the relationship needed to end."
