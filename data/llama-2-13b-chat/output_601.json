        "Summarize the following story in first person: On July 3rd 2018 my family and I bought our first home. It was such and exciting and memorable time. I remember arriving to our home and being handed the keys and being so excited to walk in as a family.  My son ran upstairs and I told him \"this will be his room\" He was so excited to be able to have a room to put is toys in! He said \"I am going to out my clothes and toys here\".  We went to the garage and we pictured our cars in there.  We had never had a garage so we were so happy to finally one.  We put a family picture on top of the fireplace to make it feel more like home.  We also went to our master bedroom and couldn't believe that we finally had our own room. My husband and I began to look around and we began to envision what changes we would do and how our furniture would look.  We were so excited to have a backyard and thought about possible BBQ s with family and friends.  We picture patio chairs and a grill. We also pictured our son running around and playing with his balls. We felt like our dreams have came true! And we truly couldn't wait to make new family memories in our new home."
