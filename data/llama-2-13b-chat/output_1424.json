        "Summarize the following story in first person: Our dog injuring his eye was absolutely terrifying and stressful.  I remember going to work that day from camp, putting him on his lead so he could hang out outside, enjoying the sunshine on my walk.  I took lunch early that day for some reason, and when I got back home he was still outside.  As I approached he seemed fine (if a little quiet), but when I made it to him...His right eye was swollen shut and was tender to the touch.  He would barely let me look at at it, which is especially odd for him.  He kept scratching it with his paw as though there was an itch he just couldn't get to, and the swelling was spreading a bit down his face and snout.  He was obviously in pain, and I had no idea what or how or when; all I knew was that my boyfriend, whose dog he is, was out for the next 3 days on a wilderness excursion with no contact and suddenly I was in charge. The next two days were awful.  He got Benedryl at first, but when that didn't do anything the vet came out to see him.  Somehow, he had managed to poke a hole in his cornea and if things went wrong he would go blind in that eye.  When I heard that, I didn't know what to do-- how do I break that to my partner?!  How did he manage to poke a hole in his cornea while by himself?!  It's not like that's something that 'just accidentally' happens all the time. He ended up in a cone for weeks, and had to take multiple medications-- one of which had to go in his swollen-shut eye.  He wasn't allowed to be outside alone anymore and had to go to a friend's house every day before work.  Because of his injury and the resulting cone, he was lethargic and not eating very much, which was compounded by the fact that my partner was still not home or able to be contacted. It ultimately worked out, and the dog did not lose his eye.  My partner came home and I saw him run through every emotion I had had for the last few days in minutes as I brought him up to speed.  Pupper still goes to the friend's house every day (we call it 'doggy daycare'), and we've become much closer to those friends as a result.  OH, and he got his outside privileges back :)"
