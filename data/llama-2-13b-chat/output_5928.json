        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last month I went with my brother in law John to a baseball game. We are both huge Yankee fans so we were excited to go together. I hadn't spent much time alone with him. I was looking forward to a little bonding, as it was important to my sister that we get along. All the Yankee games in town have been sold out this season so we decided to take a short road trip to see them out of town. We figured it would be fun to drive up to Boston and see them play the Red Sox. There is a huge rivalry between the 2 teams, so I thought it would be fun to go and cheer for the Yankees in the Red Sox ballpark. The drive up to Boston was pretty cool. We chatted and listened to music. I learned a lot about John. I always thought he was boring, but it turns out he had a pretty wild past. Once we got to the game it was absolutely insane. Everyone heckled us for wearing our Yankees jerseys. A few people even threw their popcorn at us, but it was all in good fun. I had a great time. The Yankees lost, which was upsetting, but we had so much fun it didn't even matter. By time we got back to New York I felt like me and John had really bonded. We made plans to go to another game again next month, we are thinking maybe we will go to Baltimore for this one."
