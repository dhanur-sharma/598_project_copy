        "Summarize the following story in first person: In July I went to rehab. My husband and I had been fighting about finances a lot and my absences from work. For years I had been telling myself that I would quit drinking and quit smoking cannabis, but every day I would tell myself I would start tomorrow. I realized I couldn't do it on my own so I made the call, was accepted into a program to start the next day, and after a restless night I set off to rehab. I bought a pack of cigarettes on the way there, my first in nearly three years. I was so nervous as I sat in the lobby waiting to be called. What would the days look like? Would I be taken seriously since my addiction was to a substance everyone says you can't get addicted to? What would the others be like? Would I be the youngest or the oldest? Finally my name was called and I spent the next few hours signing paperwork, paying for treatment up front, and meeting with a medical professional. I was told to strip and put on scrubs, though the pair of pants they tried to give me were much too small, and I laughed for the first time that day when they hardly slid over my knees. I was able to keep my own sweatpants, but the horrid green scrub shirt made me feel like the inmates I've seen on tv. Eventually they dropped me off down in the kitchen where a group of people were playing Cards Against Humanity. I didn't know what the plan was for the rest of the evening but that half hour spent watching these people laugh gave me some time to get my bearings. I heard names and tried to match them with faces. I saw two others in scrubs and realized it was their first day too. Some faces were happy; others looks tired, worn down, half asleep. Dinner was challenging because I don't eat animal products and usually had the assistance of marijuana to quell the nausea. The nurse offered me Ativan but I refused; I  asked her for some when I threw up some sad lettuce and yellow rice a few minutes later. During one of the cigarette breaks I familiarized myself with the others there and was convinced to sign up for a yoga class. The class was relaxing, but I cried the whole time. I was so scared, for myself, for my husband, for the future. When it was all said and done I went into my room, lay down on the small twin mattress with the plastic cover, and cried myself to sleep."

Then I went to group therapy, which was okay. The others had been there longer and were more talkative, but I was just grateful to have a place to sit and be quiet for a while. At lunch I sat with two of the women from my yoga class and we talked about how hard it was to be away from our families. After lunch I had my first one-on-one therapy session. I was nervous but the therapist was nice. She asked me a lot of questions and I was surprised at how much I was able to talk about. The rest of the day was more group therapy and free time. I read a book in the common room and then went to bed early. The next day was similar, except we had a session on relapse prevention and I felt like I was really getting somewhere. I realized that my addiction wasn't just about the substance, but about the way it made me feel. I felt like I was finally getting to the"
