        "Summarize the following story in first person: I had to learn to walk again. I had broken my ankle in a way that the doctor's thought I was going to lose my foot. I had been out for a walk, and tripped and my ankle just snapped. I was alone, but thankfully a school bus driver pulled over and called 911 and tried to keep me calm while we waited for help. After having surgery and a few casts, I did't think I would ever be able to walk like I did before. I had to go back to the basis with learning to walk. I never realized how hard it was for babies to learn. I thought that I could just get a cane, hop a little and be on my way. That did not happen. I had to have someone walking behind me while I used a walker and took tiny, little steps. I was shocked at how hard it was, and how I had taken being able to get up and walk around when I wanted for granted. My life had completely changed, and while I was taken steps both physically, mentally and literally in the right direction to get it back on track. It was hard and there were many tears and if I could have walked properly, I know I would have stormed off a time or two. But, now months later, why I still walk with a limp most days, I can at least walk. Not how I used to be able to, but I'm thankfully I can at least storm off if I ever need to."
