        "Summarize the following story in first person: I had my 65th birthday last month.  It is really hard to believe that I am now on Medicare.  I think back growing up and remember my mother's 35th birthday.  I thought that was so old.  It is amazing how we view life when we are young.    Most people think I am in my early 50's.  I am in very good health, thankfully.  I went to work as usual and thought for sure I would hear a couple of birthday greetings. Afterall, 65 is pretty special.  Needless to say, I was feeling very depressed and hurt.  I could not wait for the day to end.  I just wanted to go home and cry. It was almost lunch time when the receptionist buzzed me and said FedX had a package that needed my signature.  I didn't think twice about it since that was a typical situation.  As I start up the hallway, I am met with a loud \"HAPPY BIRTHDAY\"!!!!   The entire office staff, including our manager from Corporate, were waiting for me along with balloons, pizza, and a huge birthday cake.  I cannot tell you how surprised and pleased I was.  Here I thought they didn't care and had completely forgotten about my birthday only to be showered with the best party ever!!!"
