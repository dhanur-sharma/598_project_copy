        "Summarize the following story in first person: Recently, my car broke down. I got a new battery, replaced it, and it still wouldn't start. I had several friends come look at it for me to try and fix it because I don't have much money and knew it would be expensive to fix. Fortunately, I had a good friend that I also work with, who was willing to let me ride with her to work every day for a week and then let me borrow her car at night so that I could do other things like go to the store and the gym. One day during the week my car was broken, I got a text from my brother, saying he was coming to visit me on Saturday to bring me something. My birthday had just passed and he lives in another city about an hour and a half away so I thought he was bringing my nephew to visit me since I don't get to see him much. My brother has never randomly visited me so I was excited that he was coming. Meanwhile, during that week, my dad reached out to me and offered to pay to have my car fixed. This meant a lot to me because my relationship with me parents has been strained lately and we hadn't spoken much. Saturday came around, and my brother text me to let me know that he and my dad were both headed to visit me. My dad had a flight out of the airport near me that day so they came into town early so that the three of us could eat lunch together. When they arrived to pick me up, my brother handed me a small gift, wrapped in Christmas wrapping paper with a bow on it, and told me I couldn't open it until he left. I agreed, and we all went to eat lunch together. Once we finished eating, my dad offered to let me drive his truck until my car got fixed since it would be parked at the airport all week anyway. I appreciated that he trusted me to drive his truck while he was gone. So, I had a vehicle to drive for the next week and headed home after work feeling very grateful. At home, I opened the gift my brother gave to me. It was a small box that belonged to my grandmother before she passed away, and he included $1000 in cash inside. I immediately started sobbing. My brother has had a hard life and struggled for a long time. He battled drug addiction and has been clean for several years now. He worked incredibly hard and supports a wife and 3 kids. I called him and told him that no one had ever done something like that for me and that I would never ever forget it. He said he has never been in a place to help me and now that he was, he wanted to do something for me since he knew I was struggling financially. I was in shock and felt more grateful than I ever had in my life."
