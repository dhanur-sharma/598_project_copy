        "Summarize the following story in first person: Well today we went back to school shopping! It was so much fun to see him choosing all of his supplies and really realizing that he will be all grown up and in school here soon. He chose a Minecraft backpack which was pretty surprising to me because I didn't realize that he liked it so much. It was really cute though to learn about what he likes. I kept thinking about how much I had left to do, I need to get him a haircut and clean the house and attend all sorts of school meetings. I'm still really excited though. We are a couple of weeks out, now. I feel like that time will definitely pass quickly. Hopefully I can keep track of my to-do list and get it all done. I think first of all we'll go get his haircut done tomorrow. Later in the week I can clean the house and everything. I'm just so excited for this new chapter in our lives. I'm so proud of our kid for growing up so fast. I can't wait to see what he'll learn and how he'll change. This whole thing is more exciting that I ever expected it to be. I hope it all goes great."
