        "Summarize the following story in first person: A couple of months ago, my husband and I had a Grand Opening for the new location of our business.  A lot of planning and preparation went into this event.  Leading up to the event, we faced many unforeseen obstacles.  Our business license took several weeks to acquire.  We had to undergo many facility evaluations by the county and the state before we could open our doors.  A low point in the process was the moment we were informed that we would have to add another bathroom and an extra door before we would be cleared for business.  These were expenses we had not budgeted for, and we were not prepared.  Eventually, all of the kinks got worked out, and we were cleared to open our doors.  Many people volunteered their time and expertise to help us make our dream a reality.  On Opening Day, it truly felt as though we had climbed a mountain and were standing on a peak overlooking the past six months of our hard work.  It felt very satisfying to finally enjoy the fruits of our Labor.  We had an enormous turnout for our Grand Opening.  It was quite an event and celebration.  I felt very accomplished and excited about the future of our business.  It was gratifying to look around the room at all of the smiling faces and the people who had made the day possible.  But, the dust had barely settled on the day of our Grand Opening before we were planning next steps and dreaming of what our next location would be like.  It was one of the most fulfilling experiences of my life up to this point."
