        "Summarize the following story in first person: 6 months ago I left my husband, who 4 months ago divorced me. I am going on 8 months not living with him or seeing him much and my life has truly gotten better. It was really hard at first because I kept hearing things from others that surprised me. He was seeing another woman. He was using illegal substances. He claims now that he is an alcoholic because of me. I think the illegal substance use was the most surprising to me to find out. I had no clue. Looking back it is honestly crazy how I was with such an abusive persona and with a drug addict. How could I be with someone like this and have no clue? This just proves how much abuse can blind you. I would tell anyone going through the same situation that there is hope. Things get better with time, that is a promise. I would also tell them that just because you leave doesn't mean they will change either. You should have been good enough for him to change while you were there, not because you threaten to leave."
