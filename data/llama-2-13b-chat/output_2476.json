        "Summarize the following story in first person: Five months ago, I went on a trip that had lasting implications - it was an adventure that changed my life in a terrifyingly unexpected way. On the night of August 3rd, I packed my suitcases for my trip the following day - I was prepared get some peace by venturing back to my hometown: Detroit, Michigan. I woke up at 4:00 AM the following morning, ready to drive down to the airport. I wanted to get there early for my 7:00 AM flight so that I could get through security and have a cup of coffee before I had to jump onto my airplane. Upon my arrival, I did the usual: I checked in my luggage, went through the security checkpoints, and I still had an hour to kill before I had to hop on the plane. I went over to the cafeteria's Starbucks and ordered a tall latte - I was still tired after all, and moderately anxious for my upcoming flight. I sat down at a corner booth, drink in hand, and looked out at the airport's lobby. I saw so many people scattered about, many rushing to the gates so that they don't miss their flights. I knew that I was glad that I left early enough to relax while many others didn't. Enamored by these thoughts, I failed to recognize the gorgeous stranger who sat down at my booth, until I felt a whisper in my ear.\"I know who you are and what you've done,\" she said. Shocked, I could only muster, \"what could you possibly mean? I'm only here drinking my coffee before my flight home. I've not done anything wrong.\"Smugly, she said \"I never said that you did anything wrong. How presumptuous. My name is Ellie, and I know that you're a very prominent figure inside of a small circle within the automotive industry. You work on AI, and you have worked on inventing of the most promising safety mechanisms known to the world. I want to help you further your research, but I need you to do one thing for me first.\"Shocked by how well this woman knew me, I knew that she must have some insider information. She had an intimidating aura, but my intuition told me that I could trust her.\"What do you need?\" I asked, cautiously.\"You mustn't get on that plane - it's been rigged; it just so happens that you have a large bounty on your head. Your endeavors to benefit the world have not been well appreciated by all. Come with me - we have much to discuss,\" Ellie said. I'm glad that I trusted Ellie that day, for the plane exploded shortly after it got a few thousand feet into the air; it was all over the news for the following week. This beautiful, knowledgeable, mysterious woman saved my life - the least that I could do is listen to her, and, further more, I need to pay her back, and it looks like to do that, I need to further take her up on her offer so that I might hopefully clear this bounty that looms over my head."
