        "Summarize the following story in first person: This was an amazing experience. I've been feeling very down lately and I've felt like I've not had the help I need to cope with my mental disorders. My friends and I decided to take a psychedelic trip together. It was so amazing, I was pain-free, everything felt great. We were at my best friend John's house and we were all in his room. This was the first time that we all did it together. This happened 3 months ago and it was an amazing educational experience. I never knew that I could feel this much pleasure from an experience like this. My life has been filled with so many challenges due to my mental disorders. Sometimes I forget what I'm doing or I forget who I'm talking to. I feel like my mind plays tricks on me and it's a very difficult thing to deal with. This is the first time that I felt like I could cope with my mental disorders. My friends don't have mental disorders but they felt like it would help. I feel so much more optimistic now. I've been going on these trips again and I feel like my life is so much better now. I'm more optimistic. I also feel like I function better. Everyone in my life is impressed with how my mood has changed and feel like this is a change for the better. I will definitely continue to go on these trips. This all started 3 months ago and my life has changed for the better."
