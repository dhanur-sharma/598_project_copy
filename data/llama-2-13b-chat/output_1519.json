        "Summarize the following story in first person: I live with my husband in the suburbs. We both are retired, and leave a peaceful life on our own. We have three beautiful kids, two of them are daughters and one son. They are also happily married. They live away from us, in the town. They have busy lives, where each of them work. Each couple have two children of them, making me a grandmother of 6 adorable kids. Past two weeks have been hard for us and our entire family. I got to know that the children of one my daughter have brain cyst, both my granddaughter and my grandson. The news brought tear to my eyes, also taking away my sleep at nights at times. We found a good doctor, who could operate them. Recently, both of them got their cysts removed. They are doing a lot better, making them carry on with their normal lives. I miss them when they are not around. They are very intelligent kids."
