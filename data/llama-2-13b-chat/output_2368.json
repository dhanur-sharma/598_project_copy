        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last July of this year, my brother and his family who lives in the Philippines, Me and my family, my mom and our youngest brother, all met up in Vancouver, Canada where my sister and his family lives.  We were all there for 3 weeks for our annual family vacation.  Our stay there was very memorable because we went to places where some movies and TV series' were filmed.  We went to Hatley Park National Historic Site where X-Men were filmed.  We also went to the place were Once Upon a Time was filmed.  It is where \"StoryBrooke\" was filmed.  The place where the bakery and the coffee shop were located.  We also went to Capilano Bridge.  It is a long bridge and it is kind of scary because it is high and the bridge is kind of shaky.  We also went to Whistler Village.  The view there was very mesmerizing with all the mountains surrounding our hotel.  The most memorable event for me during our vacation was when we stayed at my sister's apartment.  Why?  Because their apartment is just walking distance from the mall, the train and the convenience stores!  It's just 5 minutes away!  I was literally at the mall almost everyday!"
