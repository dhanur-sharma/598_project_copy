        "Summarize the following story in first person: So, 4 months ago, my best friend left. I was PISSED. I'll be honest with you, I didn't think he would leave without saying goodbye. I just felt so angry at him and the thought he could just go without saying anything--like, what if I never see him again? I tried texting, no response. He's just decided to up and ghost me now, I guess we were never really friends in the first place, huh? I just wanted to give him a hug goodbye. I don't know, I just feel hurt. Yeah, he was the one leaving and I'm being selfish. But I feel like I deserved a goodbye. I just really missed him. I really hope we can see each other again. I didn't mean to be clingy or weird about it, it's not like that. I just feel lonely sometimes and he's the only person I could ever call a true friend and person I could confide in, and he just decided to drop all of that and leave me in the dust. Which, ok, cool. Whatever. Fine. I'll find a new friend anyway, but that doesn't mean this hurts any less. It's been 4 months, I'm still not over it."
