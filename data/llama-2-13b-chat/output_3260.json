        "Summarize the following story in first person: 4 months ago while I was home taking care of my father something horrible happened. As I was making him lunch I heard a loud thump. I ran upstairs to see what the noise was. I walked into my fathers room to see him laying on the floor. I knew something horrible had happened. I called out to my father, no answer. I turned my father over to see he was not breathing. I grabbed my cell phone and called 911. They sent and ambulance, but at that point it was to late. When the paramedics got there they said he was gone. This loss I've experienced has destroyed me. My father was my life and all I want to do was make him proud. Even in his sick days, having to take care of him, I loved all the time we spent together. This is going to be hard to get over. I pray for the strength to overcome this."
