        "Summarize the following story in first person: 3 Months ago I made a huge life choice. After dropping out when I was younger, I finally decided to go back to college to finish my degree. Though the prospect in front of me seemed much harder than in the past. Now I had to work a job on top of going back to school and that seemed like a lot of hard work. I knew though that if I didn't go back to school, not only would I regret it, but I would be stuck where I was possibly forever. I started by making sure that my job would allow me to go back to school and thankfully they were happy to give me lighter workloads and flexibility. So I started planning my classes and getting ready to work hard. The first few weeks were tough even though I felt I was prepared. Too many times I didn't get enough sleep because I had to study and even had a few night classes. Even with flexible work schedules I still had problems with keeping up with my two responsibilities. However after the first month I felt like my mind and body had adjusted and I was working harder and better. I was also learning many new things in school and I felt I not only could do this, but thrive. All the work and studying made me realize I could do more than I thought I could. I did feel some shame that I didn't do this earlier, but the important thing was that I was doing it now. Hopefully I keep learning and growing as I continue on."
