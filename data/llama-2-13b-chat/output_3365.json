        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was re-doing my kitchen my neighbor had a free stove that he let me have. 2 months ago Building a strong relationship with your landlord is akin to having strong ties with your parents or siblings. It\u2019s often difficult, and sometimes it can even seem impossible, but in the long run, it\u2019s more than worth it. When you need a favor, a landlord who likes you (like a trusted family member) can be a real lifesaver. Of course, that doesn\u2019t mean you have to bake them cookies or mow their lawn. Just pay your rent on time, let them know immediately if you ever need a little more time to gather the money, and don\u2019t make a habit of paying late. Beyond that, just make sure you know your landlord-tenant rights both locally and nationally, and your relationship should be easy-going and mutually beneficial. No matter where you live, specific rights apply to all tenant-landlord relationships, regardless of whether they\u2019re spelled out in or omitted from your particular lease agreement. These include but are not limited to the right to receive police assistance in emergency situations free of charge, the right not to cover a landlord\u2019s legal fees in the event of a dispute that ends up in court, and the prohibition of landlords from discriminating against prospective tenants on the grounds that they have children. Similarly, the law dictates that all tenants have a certain set of responsibilities inherent to their rental agreements. For instance, tenants are required to pay their rent in full on the day outlined in their lease. Tenants must use amenities like parking .lots and laundry rooms responsibly and without causing harm or destruction to them. Tenants are obligated to dispose of all waste materials such as car batteries, motor oil, and electronics in a safe and proper manner. It was a surprise encounter at just the right moment. It was good timing since I hadn't talked to my neighbor in a while before this. In addition, some states, counties, cities, and municipalities have laws and statutes in place that expressly prohibit tenants from participating in gang activity, physical assault, or the sale/purchase of illegal substances. Unlawfully using a firearm on the premises is another hard no. you feel like your rights have been violated, contact your local tenants\u2019 rights organization for assistance. In the event that they agree that your rights may have been violated or that the landlord\u2019s demands are illegal, seek legal assistance to determine your options. Ignoring disputes usually only escalates the problem and creates bad blood between you and your landlord .a situation that can seriously tarnish your peaceful home life. I have been in My apt I month and I have no hot water for three weeks what do I need to do. And everyday I call they tell me it will be on today. That doesn't work I tried and they told me to do the counxiling and they kept giving me a different number"
