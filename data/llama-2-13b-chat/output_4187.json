        "Summarize the following story in first person: The most memorable thing to happen to me over the past few months was a huge argument with my best friend. We were supposed to go out and do something and instead she ended up calling, for the third time, to cancel. I just unloaded on her, told her that I am tired of being the only active participant in this friendship. She gave me a sob story about how she's just been too busy to spend time with me.  I don't know if that's true, but I don't care.  She kept coming up with excuses and never even bothered to call me and ask how I was doing. So we had a huge argument and we have been angry at one another ever since. I haven't really spoken to her, other than just to say hi in passing, for over a month. She doesn't even seem to care, which hurts even more.  I regret that we had such a horrible fight, but I don't think it was my fault. I think that she could have easily spent some time at least writing me. She didn't even bother to do that, she just ignored me. I don't know if we will ever be good friends again. The fight was bad, but the time since has been even worse. She hasn't even bothered to try to clear the air or talk to me. I did try to talk to her a couple of times but she never responded. My feelings are really hurt."
