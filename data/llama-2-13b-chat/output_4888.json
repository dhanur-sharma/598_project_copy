        "Summarize the following story in first person: I sent my kids to go stay with their Uncle, Aunt and Cousins this summer thinking it would be a good way for them to be a part of their dad's family, especially since they haven't seen their dad in years.  Everyone was very excited to spend time together, get to play together and become a family in spite of their dad.  The boys got along with the Uncle and the cousins, who are all girls, got along with my daughter.  The only one no one could stand was the aunt (newly married). The visit took a bad turn when the Aunt started treating my daughter more like an 'evil step daughter' than one of her family.  If my daughter left out clothes or food she would call her many ugly names and send her away to her room alone.  It made a weird rift between my daughter and her cousins, Uncle and brother.  No one felt comfortable and my daughter called every day for me to allow her to fly home.  I don't quite understand anything that happened because their last visit last summer was amazing and my daughter didn't even want to come home.  My daughter felt picked on and her brothers didn't do anything to aleviate the situation.  Her biological uncle made things worse by feeding the fuel and going back to his wife saying nasty things about my daughter.  It was just an ugly situation and I was glad when she got home.  My relationship was never great with them but now it's non-existent.  I'm happy that the boys maintained a good relationship with their uncle and cousins but the lashing out from their Aunt to their sister has scared their relationship forever and has put the boys in an awkward situations.  At least the Uncle has been calling the boys every week to check in.  My daughter is not ready to talk to her Aunt or Uncle and even feels badly towards her cousins who didn't step in to help my daughter when she was being verbally attacked by the Aunt (the cousin's mom)."
