        "Summarize the following story in first person: This event I can remember easily because it was on a holiday and near my fathers birthday. I have been a casual gambler now for about ten years, with a few wins and losses mostly small. I loved to play video poker and had saved up quite a bit of comp dollars, which is money you can spend at the casino you earn from gambling. As St. Patrick's day drew near, the casino begin advertising a special holiday menu at the various restaurants. I had decided to my parents out to eat during to holiday to indulge at the special menu celebration for my fathers birthday. When I arrived to get my parents to eat, my father had forgotten about the reservation and ate breakfast. I told him no to worry and set off at the casino alone. I arrived to the very busy restaurant. I ate the special meal and was very full. After my meal, I decided to gamble a little bit, but in the high limit area. This makes me very nervous as you can lose money very fast. I had saw a game that I have seen people online play and win big, I decided to try. This was after I was down quite a bit. After a few spins, the bonus was hit. This game has a particular bonus, as after each spin, the line hits rise in multipliers  by 1. So after getting a few free games and a re-trigger, on spin seventeen resulted in a line hit of over seven thousand! The total bonus was almost ten thousand dollars. I stood there shocked and amazed. Winning this money really changed my life, as it helped me pay off a tremendous amount of debt."
