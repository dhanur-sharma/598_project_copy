        "Summarize the following story in first person: Dear diary,I can\u2019t believe my life has fallen apart like this. I\u2019ve been married for ten years - what I thought were ten happy years. I knew my husband had been unfaithful in the past but he convinced me it was a mistake and it would never happen again. I forgave him and I worked to make changes to better our marriage. But last week I found out he\u2019s cheating again. This is such a disaster. I feel so hurt, betrayed, and taken advantage of. Fool me once, shame on me, it\u2019s not going to happen again. I\u2019ve already met with a divorce lawyer. I know I\u2019m going to be ok but it just hurts so much. He was my best friend for ten years, and now our memories mean nothing. He is a stranger. Our son is going to have to grow up in a broken home. We\u2019re going to have to sell the house and downsize and I\u2019m going to have to work more hours. I\u2019m just so sad and disappointed. I thought my life would look different but here I am. I wish I could just fast forward the next year of my life."
