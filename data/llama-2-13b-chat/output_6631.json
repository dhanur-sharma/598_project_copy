        "Summarize the following story in first person: This June, my boyfriend and I decided to get married. We had been talking about it for a while, and the timing finally seemed right. We couldn't afford a large wedding ceremony and reception and all of the expenses that go along with traditionally getting married in the United States, so we decided to elope at home. We planned a short, private \"ceremony\" in our living room to be held the following week, and we invited only our close and direct family members to attend. In that week, I bought a casual $100 white dress and a small faux bouquet of flowers for our ceremony. My boyfriend and I were nervous a bit that we were moving too fast or not thinking everything through, but we knew we wanted to be married and that pre-wedding jitters are normal. The night before we married, we went out for a special dinner just the two of us. We discussed our nerves but also our excitement, and we wrapped up our vows that we planned on saying to each other. The next morning, the strap on my dress broke and we told our families to come over an hour later than planned so I could fix it to wear for our marriage. I was stressed out and cried a bit, wondering if this was a mistake and that we should wait to have a \"proper\" engagement and wedding. However, I told myself that the wedding itself wasn't the important part, the marriage was, and I was positive I wanted to get married. I fixed my dress, our families arrived, and everything was wonderful. We played some music and read our vows, I got very emotional and cried, and so did our families. My husband's family surprised us with a beautiful cake and champagne, and we had a toast and cut the cake. We grabbed a broomstick from our basement and jumped over it since our wedding was actually more of an elopement. We took a ton of photos in our living room to remember the special day, and went out to dinner together as a new family. I'll always remember this special day that I got married even though it wasn't what I imagined it to be. It was low-key and casual, and it was very special to us even though it was not a traditional wedding."
