        "Summarize the following story in first person: The event was a family gathering, as well as a yearly tradition tradition that signaled the end of summer. There was a lot of food at the fishing derby, hot dogs, burgers, macaroni salads, and much more, and I loved eating all of it. I might have even eaten too much during the event because I got a stomachache afterwards. But then I had to make room for dessert and I just couldn't resist the temptation of some amazing cake, even though I regretted the overfull feeling I felt later, if only a bit. Lots of my family members whom I don't get to see very often were there at the derby and I got to talk to them. I talked to my aunts and uncles and cousins and their kids, and it was nice being able to catch up with them. Some of my nieces and nephews had grown up a lot since the last time I had seen them, some were entering high school and others weren't little infants anymore, and were toddling and running about everywhere around the stock pond. There was a fishing contest for all the kids, which is why the event was called a fishing derby, where they all would fish and catch frogs from my aunt's stock pond. I didn't participate in the derby games because I'm a bit too old to do that anymore. Perhaps maybe my lack of participation in the contests might have just been because I don't really like how slimy fish and frogs feel in my hands. The kids all had some other contests for them to compete in as well, and I watched from the sidelines with the adults. During the frog race, the kids all picked one caught frog, and had to coax them to hop across a finish line the fastest. But a surprising thing happened during the frog race, one of the kids accidentally coaxed their frog to jump onto me and I might have panicked reflexively. But on the other hand I ended up kicking out my foot and flinging the frog over the finish line, making my little cousin the winner of that round. It was a fun event, with lots of laughs and a bunch of good memories for me."
