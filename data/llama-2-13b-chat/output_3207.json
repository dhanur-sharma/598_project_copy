        "Summarize the following story in first person: The night was young and I had just gone over to a new friend's house, who I also had romantic feelings for. We had made plans earlier in the week to take acid that night. We both took a tab and waited for it to hit us before we walked to the bank. She needed to get the money out and it would be more fun that way, which it was. Once the effects started to kick in, the euphoria, seeing shapes and interesting images, we got up and left for the bank which was about half a mile away. It started pouring rain, which would've sucked any other time, but since we were both tripping on acid we took our shoes off. We were walking through the grass and talking about how good it felt on acid. At one point we started talking about our ancestors that walked there before us. We felt the universe both within us and flowing through us. We started playing music and singing along to Lady Gaga, the whole shabang. I remember my goal was to just make sure she got home safely, as she was definitely tripping harder than I was. We got to the bank, and tried our best to get the atm to work. It was going on 1 AM at this point.  Even while tripping, we eventually got it to work and made it home fine, somehow managing not to step on glass. Once we got in we both took another half tab. We almost ended up having sex, but were too giggly and disorientated to get to it. We ended up cuddling and it was during this where I felt like our bodies had merged into one. It was the most intimate experience I ever had with another human being."
