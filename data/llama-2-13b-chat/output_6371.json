        "Summarize the following story in first person: 3 months ago i was having car trouble and needed extra money for repairs. ive worked with my employer for 4 years and i felt it was about time i got a promotion. if i got the promotion it would help with my money issue as well as helping me move up in the company. after my lunch break one day i confronted my boss about it. he asked me to sit down and told me to tell him why i think i deserve the promotion. i told him that ive been with the company for four years and ive always been on time and overall a good employee. he told me he didint think i was right for the position. he told me he would talk to his assistant and he would get back to me in a few days with a answer. those 3 days seemed to take forever. finally on the third day when i went to work he asked me to see him in his office. i sat down and he told me that after looking over my work he decided to give me the promotion after all. i was really glad. the following month i got my car fixed. life up to this point has been great to me. next time i will remember to ask even if i dont think i will get what i want it never hurts to ask."
