I wasn't sure what was causing it, but I knew I was having trouble sleeping and I picked up some over the counter sleep aids. It turned out that this was exactly what I needed. The heart flutter went away and I felt fine after that. I told my friend the story and it worried him. I told him I was fine now, but that didn't seem to satisfy him. We went to a street fair and he kept telling me to slow down and take it easy. Again, I told him I was fine. He didn't have to worry. I was good. But he insisted. I was touched by how concerned he was. I was also a little annoyed."
