        "Summarize the following story in first person: Dear Diary, Today I will be revisiting the painful and life altering experience that I've endured recently. I find it beneficial and therapeutic to write out these experiences. I believe that writing everything out is the only real way that I can begin to heal from these events. It was only a short time ago that I got evicted from my apartment. There were several reasons why I got evicted. The first and most direct reason I would say is that my roommate, Cole, moved out unexpectedly. He truly just got bored with living there and made way too much money illegally and not nearly enough money legally. It definitely took a toll on the household. He wasn't pulling his weight and he truly hated that I wanted him to get a real job. So he moved out and that was that. Unfortunately, he left less than a week before rent was due and so I was stuck paying for all the rent plus my other bills. I tried making a payment plan with the front office that ended up not working. When I was served with an eviction notice, I really went into denial and thought I could save the apartment rather than take immediate action and go out looking for a new place to live. So when it came time for court, I was told I had a week to vacate. I couldn't afford or find a new place in time and I was moving my things out of the apartment at the very last second. The problem was that I felt responsible for my safety, my fiance's safety, and the safety of my two cats. Yet I had nowhere to go. We had to take all of our belongings to a storage unit and stay in our car. We drove a PT Cruiser at the time and luckily it was pretty roomy after taking out the back seats and building a little bed area in the back seat. We made a litter box for the cats that we could put a lid on when not in use. It was hard because I felt like such a failure that couldn't even take care of my family. This went on for well over a month of having to find places to park at night and sleep, find food, brushing my teeth and washing my hair in public bathrooms, and hoping that I can find places to shower or do my laundry. The stress got to me and I wasn't sure I could even keep going. Now I'm living with my in laws and slowly trying to rebuild my life. The only real downside is their aversion to the fact that I'm a woman dating their daughter."
