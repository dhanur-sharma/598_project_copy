        "Summarize the following story in first person: During my lunch break, about three months ago, I ran into an old colleague from a previous employer at a coffee shop. We sat and chatted over coffee during my break and caught up on each other's lives. He told me about his family and how great he and his wife were doing. While chatting about what a nightmare our previous employer was and gossiping about former coworkers, they told me that they too finally left the place. They were frustrated that the career wasn't going anywhere and have been working odd end and meager jobs while applying for more suitable positions. He was also growing concerned because he has a family to support and his wife is already working as much as she can. I told him about my current company and the culture there and expressed that we are usually looking for people. I asked him if he could email me his resume and information and I would try to forward it on to my boss. We exchanged information and I went back to work. As soon as I checked my email, my old colleague's resume was there. As promised, I went to my boss and told her about him and his situation. She listened and said the we should be able to find something for him so I thought so highly of him. I gave her the resume and his information and left. I returned to my cubicle and sent him a quick note to let him know that his information was passed on and my boss sounded interested in him. I asked him to keep in touch and let me know how things went. I also asked if he wanted to get together sometime soon after the job search stress was over. After a week, my former colleague contacted me and said that they had been hired. They were greatly relieved to have new job security and wanted to go out and celebrate. We went out and had a great time. Now, we often get together after work and maintain a great social and work relationship. We don't work in the same departments, but do have some contact with each other in the office. It worked out well and makes me feel good that I was able to help them out."
