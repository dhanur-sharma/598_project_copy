        "Summarize the following story in first person: So last week my youngest daughter graduated from middle school. The weird thing about it is that we both attended the same school. When I went to the graduation ceremony it was a trip and a half. It reminded me so much of all the good times that I had as a young teen and how much different the times were back then. I was a youing adult when I had her but it seems like a lifetime ago. Times were so much easier then though. The internet hadnt been invented yet and there werent as many bad temptations as there were when I was growing up. Now with he world wide web it seems as if there is way to much information at our fingertips and it has made the youth a whole lot lazier. Anyways, as I was walking through the halls I remembered places that we would get together and talk between classes and doors that we would run out of if we decided to play hookie or sluff. I remembeed all the little girls that I wanted or did kiss. ai remembered where my old locker was and it turns out that it was in tha same hall as mine. I wonder if I would have been friends with my daughter if things were different and she wasnt my daughter but just another peer. I talked to her about all of the things that were going through my head and she said that I was weirding her out. Then I asked her about what high school she wanted to go to because she had the choice of three different schools in the area. She said that she wasnt sure cause she wanrwed to go to a school that the majority of her friends went to but she also wanted to not be distracted because of them as well. I on the other hand made the decision ro go to a school that none of my friends went to so that I could focus on studies and it wasnt a very god choice for me. I ended up having as really haed time because I didnt know any one and in turn it affected my studies in a negative way becaus I never wanted to go to class I wanted to go and hang ouy with my friends. I just hope that she makes the best decision for herself and it works out well for her in the long run, School is supposed to be a fun time when wr get to learn about ourselves and others and how to succeed in a modern day environment. O have faith that she will do well. I have discdussed this with her and told her that what ever decision she made that I would have her back no matter what. I think that if I dont put as much pressure on her about it that she will make a better decision and iy will enrich her future. All in all it was a trip to walk down those halls with a different perspective than what I had before. Life is crazy and every day it seems to get more crazy in some odd amazing way."
