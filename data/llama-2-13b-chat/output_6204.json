        "Summarize the following story in first person: A few weeks ago, my grandmother died. She went peacefully in her sleep and we held the funeral for her a couple of days after her death. My mother and sister both spoke at her funeral and we visited with friends and family at her visitation and post-funeral dinner. My grandmother was 94 (one month from turning 95) when she died and usually for someone that old there aren't usually that many people that show up for a funeral, or at least that's what the funeral home told us. But, between the visitation and funeral there were almost 300 people that showed up shocking all of us. It really speaks to how connected my grandmother was to her community and how impactful my grandmother's life was on that community. Person after person would tell me a story about how my grandmother helped them or provided them with something when they were in need and it was great hearing all of their stories. It really made me feel connected more to my grandmother, but at the same time I felt sad for her community, because while I was losing my grandmother, they were losing a community leader. It seems like there are fewer and fewer people like my grandmother in this world and losing her just makes that belief feel worse. One story I was told by a middle-aged woman named Alice really stuck with me. Alice told me how my grandmother would visit her mother, who had dementia, every weekend and sit with her and they would talk, do puzzles (my grandmother loved puzzles) and knit together. Alice told me through tears how much her mother loved her weekends with my grandmother and would look forward to them every week until her passing a year or so ago. I heard stories of grief, happiness, salvation, pride, sacrifice, and charity surrounding my grandmother's life and it's something I won't soon forget. I was very protective of the last week I spent with my grandmother in the hospital and while I do have some regret in wishing I had talked to her more in the weeks following my visit, I am thankful for the time I got to spend with her that last time. I will always love my grandmother and cherish the memories I have of her and of the time I spent with her."
