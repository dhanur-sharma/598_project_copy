        "Summarize the following story in first person: I have thought about this since I was a little kid. I have worked for it since High School and now it's finally here. I AM A JUNIOR ARCHITECT FOR THE BEST FIRM IN NY! After all the dreams and hard work it seems surreal that I was finally hired. I am so excited to get to work however have to admit I'm nervous. What if I am not as good as they hoped? What if I don't get along with my co-workers. Although I've dreamed and imagined this day for as long as I can remember it's the little things I never considered. What am I going to wear? What if I don't do well? What if the hours are too long? How is this going to change my family and household? I know it's going to take a lot of work but I'm concerned about neglecting the other parts of my life.  Over all I'm going to just have to push these feelings aside and embrace this opportunity. I will do my best and hope that it all works out in my favor. I know financially this is the best choice for my family and that it's what I love doing. SO EXCITING."
