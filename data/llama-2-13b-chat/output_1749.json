        "Summarize the following story in first person: A couple of weeks ago I had an interaction with a friend that really made me irritated. We were planning to move into an apartment together and all of a sudden she changed her mind. She was actually the person that had to convince me as when the idea was initially brought up to me I said no thinking that I would rather have my own apartment still. Well she ended up convincing me that it would a smarter deal as we would each save money. Well on the day in focus(after a week of ghosting me) she told me that she thinks she is moving elsewhere. This really put me in a bad spot as I have already talked to my rental agents and confirmed I wanted a 3 bedroom. Well there was no reason given so I just asked what changed and she had no answer for me. I kind of dropped the topic and just kept fishing as we smoked but I think she could tell that I was irritated. This has put a strain on our friendship as I feel that she is not as trustworthy as I initially thought. I tried to cool down after our initial conversation and make some small talk but I could tell that the vibe was weird. Omy did not really say sorry or anything. I think this is one of the main things that irritated me. I mean she could have at least apologized for not bringing this up a month ago when I'm sure that she started to feel this way. After I caught the amount of fish that I wanted I said my goodbyes. She asked me if I wanted to hang out the next day and I just said I had to work and went home."
