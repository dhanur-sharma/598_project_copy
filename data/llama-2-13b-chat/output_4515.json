        "Summarize the following story in first person: I knew the weather was bad but did not expect a tornado that day.  The door walls were open to the deck and about 30 of the 40 rescue cats were out on the deck.  The siren went off and I immediately went into panic mode.  I checked the internet and saw that the tornado was very close and headed my way. I started grabbing cats and running them down into the basement rooms. Some cats do not get along, and I had to split them into different rooms.  Some of the cats are wild and do not like to be handled, so I took the ones that were easiest to catch first. I had decisions to make and I did not like it but was running on automatic.  As the siren blared, I grabbed a bunch of cat carriers and started throwing cats in them.  I then carried the carriers downstairs.  I remember the tears running down my face.  I remember being exhausted but not stopping.  I had all of the cats in the house but not all in the basement.  I closed the doors to the house as reality set in and I knew I wasn't going to get them all into the basement in time.  I froze and stood there looking at the remaining cats. Do i take the old ones? The young ones?  The disabled ones? I made my choices,had to leave a few upstairs.  I stood outside the bedroom basement door with a bag of cat treats shaking it and calling the rest o the cats.  I closed myself in with the cats until the tornado passed.  In the end it turned out everyone was fine, but it is still extremely hard for me to think about the choices I had to make."
