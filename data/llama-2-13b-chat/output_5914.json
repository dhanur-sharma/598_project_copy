        "Summarize the following story in first person: My trip with my family to the mountains of North Carolina is a very fond memory. I have since been able to go back and enjoy some of the wonderful areas that were explored on the original trip. The sightseeing and traveling down remote forest will always be a exciting hobby of mine. I love to explore and find hidden campsites for future use. The original trip had a lot of memorable events that will last in memory for a very long time.  We spent time with family cooking out and hanging out by the campfire. The scenic drives through the mountains are always fun. We were able to stop at many different sites such as waterfalls and scenic overlooks to take pictures. We even took a trip to the casino to do a little gambling and it was a blast. We rode through many of the developed campgrounds in the area to see if we wanted to make a return visit in the future. Even though they were nice, none of these campgrounds compare to the remote and dispersed campgrounds found off of forest roads. The overall privacy and being alone with nature is ultimate experience when it comes to camping. Being able to find a site next to a mountain creek and do some garnet or ruby hunting is one of my most favorite things in life. I will definitely return soon to take advantage of these campsites. The mountains will always be my most favorite travel destination."
