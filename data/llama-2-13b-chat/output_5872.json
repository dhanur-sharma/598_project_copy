        "Summarize the following story in first person: My story is about when my best friend passed away. We were very close and her death was extremely unexpected. After a vacation was supposed to be back at work on Monday morning. Upon arriving at work, my boss brought me into the office. He told me she had passed away in her sleep the prior night. My heart dropped. How could this have happened to a healthy 42 year old? Why was I hearing about this from my boss? I actually did not believe him, and wondered why he was doing this to me? I had just talked to her yesterday! Losing her rocked my world. I was lost. I could not function at work or home. My kids were upset, she was like an aunt to them. It was honestly one of the worst things I ever went through. One of the worst things for me was how I learned about her passing. I was so hurt that her family did not call me. I just didn't understand how someone who was like a sister to me could just be gone, and I had to find out by my boss. Since she was so young, they did not release her body for burial until 2 weeks later. Her husband held the funeral a week later. It has been a very difficult month since the funeral. I often pick up my phone to call or text her. I have read through our text messages so many times that I have them memorized."
