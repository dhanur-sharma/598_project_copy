Maybe it was a mosquito bite that gave me something. I've been trying to get my diet back on point: get lots of fiber, avoid meat, eat veggies, and of course, stay hydrated. That is all easier said than done when you have the sweltering summer heat and humidity pounding on you. I was sweating bullets. There's summer lethargy and then there was this. It was as though I was lacking in all energy. The pain was sharp. I thought electrolytes would help, but it just made me throw it all back up. There goes my lunch, right down the drain. Even walking to the bathroom was tough. I had to admit it was time to go to the hospital."
