        "Summarize the following story in first person: I recently moved into my own apartment with my partner. We had been saving up and trying our best to make this dream come true for a long time. We were both very proud and thrilled when we got the call that we had been approved!  Our first order of business was to sign the lease and prepare for move in. We then went to Ikea to buy all of our new furniture. That was one of the most fun shopping trips I have ever had! My partner and I generally agreed on a style that we already had in mind for our new home. Once we had bought all the furniture we could buy we also went to Walmart to buy all the supplies and toiletries we would need. We went online to look at Uhaul services near us and how much they would cost. It was a lot more expensive than I had expected but it was very much worth it! Once we reserved a Uhaul we also asked around for any family that might want to help us move. Her parents gladly offered and I couldn't be more happy. It seemed like a lifetime between the time we made all our plans and shopping and the time our big day arrived. We did most of our packing during this time. When our big day arrived we loaded up the Uhaul and made our journey about an hour away. We got to our apartment and spent the day unpacking and building all our Ikea furniture. It was a very special time for us."
