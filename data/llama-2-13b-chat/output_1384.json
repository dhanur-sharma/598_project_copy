        "Summarize the following story in first person: I can't I just met this guy 6 months ago.  He came to me in at a time in my life when I was in turmoil.  My mother and I had stopped speaking, my dad was far away, and I didn't feel like I was close to anyone.  I was merely existing in a world and had no direction.  An occasional thought of suicide would pop into my head and it scared me.  While I was at the pharmacy picking up anti-depressants that were prescribed to me, I bumped into a man.  I immediately started to apologize and felt my face heating up.  He just smiled at me and told me not to worry.  I must have just stared at him because his smile was so sincere, so he asked if I was okay.  That made me laugh out of embarrassment.  My name was called at that moment to pick up my pills, and he was waiting for me when I was done checking out.  He asked if maybe I'd like to get some coffee next door.  I had nowhere else to be, and really just wanted some human  contact, so I said yes.  We really connected.  He made me realize life is worthwhile and there is beauty in everything, especially when you least expect to find it.  We've been dating steadily now and I've just started talking to my mom again.  I think I'm going to be okay after all."
