        "Summarize the following story in first person: My sister died in May of 2018. A few weeks later, we had a Memorial. Just some photos, food, stories swapped etc. It was very moving, and we all cried at some point. My sister was only 57, and it was suicide. Too young and so sad. We vowed that we would get together yearly to remember her. My niece lives fairly far away, as do the other people that were at the first one. This past year (June 2019 ), we all got together for another Memorial. We all met at a restaurant in Philadelphia where I live. It was a Greek place and it was a lunch gathering. We all chatted, and it was great to see everyone. I had made each person a sun-catcher out of glass beads and colored wire because my sister loved the sun. I didn't expect some of the reactions. Some people cried. After the restaurant, we went to a church that a family member belonged to and had desserts and coffee. I also made a memory box where everyone could write a memory they had of my sister, and then it was given  to my niece. It was especially sad for me because I hadn't seen my sister in over 10 years, we were estranged. I had tried many times to get her to come to Philly, and I asked if I could come and see her. She refused every time. I'd give anything just to see her again. I do believe in God and heaven, so I have hope that I will see her some day. She suffered from mental illness, and she was always taking pills and drinking.  She was never happy. I'm never happy either, but, I trudge on."
