        "Summarize the following story in first person: Sometimes I feel like I'll never master the guitar. Seriously, whenever I feel like I'm \"getting it\", I'm slapped by the harsh reality of mediocrity. Luckily, my teacher is such a positive dude and always seems to get me back on track. My feelings of inadequacy will probably never go away. But, they seem to be getting shorter and less intense. I don't know how he does it and sticks with me until it clicks. Maybe he's brainwashing me or something. LOL. Anyway, I'm really grateful for his tutelage and don't know what I would do without him. The funny thing is, I've seen my teacher play. And he's not that good! I guess he just has the right personality to teach. In any case, I'm happy to have him to push me forward. I don't know if I'll ever be great. But, I sure do have a lot of fun when I get in my groove. Party on, Wayne!"
