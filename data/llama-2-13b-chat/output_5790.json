        "Summarize the following story in first person: I had some amazing news a few months ago. The college I want to attend the most sent me letter saying that they accepted me as a student at their school. I was floored! Of course I wanted to go to Berkley for Music. It was so prestigious. I had wanted to go since I was a child. My parents were ecstatic when I told them. Once all of the excitement calmed down, a lot of things had to be planned. I had a few scholarships which will make schooling more affordable. It will not cover all of it though. We decided I would work as I went to school to help cover the cost of my classes each semester. I have to live on campus first year and I will be across the country from my parents. I think this is the hardest part. I have never been this far away from my family for so long. Even when I would go to camps or music competitions, they were just a drive away from me. Now we would have to fly back and forth. It is going to take a lot of adjusting or both me and my parents. The excitement of it all is very much worth it. My future looks so exciting!"
