        "Summarize the following story in first person: This was a story about my daughter deciding to move out of the house, as previously discussed. My daughter moved out very quickly and went to live with my mother-in-law who lives about two miles away.   She is kind enough and claims to be \"non-judgmental\", but loves to dish out judgment whenever it suits her.  That said, my daughter thought this was a better way to live than to stay with us.  As she is 18, there is little we could do about that.  However, that doesn't change the fact that my wife and I were heartbroken about this situation.  But, we laid back and let her \"do her thing\" which, apparently, included quitting her job, something we would not have allowed.  (We require our children to work and help support themselves once they are old enough).  Generally speaking, she avoided contact with us, in spite of our efforts to be inviting and friendly.  We did our best to honor her wishes unless she contacted us.  We did get occasional negative feedback from my mother-in-law, which we ignored as best we could.  This was not how we wanted things to go for her, but as a teenager, she apparently knows better.  We were concerned that she would not continue with school (for which she has a full scholarship) or would do other \"dumb\" things.  All we could really do was sit back and wait.  Heck, even when she would come over to the house to see her sisters, she would only do so when my wife and I were not at home.  And, she would sneak away after we came back home.  It has been a distressing few months, to say the least. For many years we've had cats in our home, and our children grew up with those cats.  We had one pass away in late 2016, whom we missed greatly.  But of the two remaining cats, one had been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism two or three years ago.  We had been treating this with medicine and he seemed to have responded well overall.  However, in early October of this year, I found him under the bed of one of my other daughters and when I pulled him out, I realized that something was seriously wrong with him - it appeared he had had a stroke and was paralyzed and blind.  This cat was a much-beloved member of the family, and particularly to my daughters.  We took him to the vet who confirmed what we thought and had him put down.  It did break our hearts, but it did one thing that surprised us:  our daughter began coming around again when my wife and I were around and would at least say...something...to us, which we considered to be a huge improvement."

I have to admit, I've been concerned about my daughter's future.  We have always encouraged our children to go to college, but our daughter did not seem to be on the same page.  It was not that she didn't want to go to college, it was just that she didn't seem to have the same level of academic drive as her sisters.  We have had some long discussions about her future and have tried to help her see the importance of a college education.  I'm not sure if she is listening, but we are going to keep trying.  All in all, it has been a very difficult year and a half, but we are trying to keep our chins up and support our daughter in any way we can."
