They checked my blood pressure. They checked my weight. They checked my cholesterol levels. They checked to find out how active I was. They checked my flexibility. They checked my physical strength. They checked my hearing and inside my ears. There were other things they checked as well. Afterwards, I was to come in again. For this purpose, it was to receive the results of the physical.
