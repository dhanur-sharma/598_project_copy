        "Summarize the following story in first person: Three months ago my friend and I started our road trip. We started from San Francisco and the destination was Los Angeles. We did not make any plans, but we stick to follow the Pacific Coast Highway. During the trip we stopped at many cool locations, including a coffee place where my friend met a girl who was also doing a road trip. However, she was alone and did not had a car, as she was mostly relying on rides. We offered her to join us on the rest of the trip, which she promptly accepted. We continued our journey visiting many small places and seeing very nice landscapes. During the trip, the new girl and my friend started to flirt with each other. One or two days later they starting to date. Once we arrived in Los Angeles, they booked a separated room for them. Later on, we found out that the girl was from San Francisco as well. We then came back to our town, but this time we flew. The girl came with us. Looking back to the road trip, it was a very pleasant experience for me and especially for my friend. My friend is still dating the girl we met in the trip. In fact, I think he is about to propose to her. I think that without the road trip, he would never had fallen in love with this girl and be about to start a marriage. My friend thanks me a lot for this, since the road trip was my idea."
