        "Summarize the following story in first person: Dear diary,I had a surprising conversation with my boyfriend last week. Even though we've been together for almost 8 years, we seem to sometimes have trouble understanding each others thoughts and feelings. I moved away from my children and grandchildren to be here with him, and although we had experienced some problems with finances and my health since then, I think we have mostly been happy. The night before, we had been talking about my not really knowing anyone here after all this time, and that missed having friends and family close by. I guess I was not as clear as I intended. He got very quiet, and a short time later, went to bed. The next morning, he was really quiet and not smiling when I smiled at him. He just seemed \"off\", and I thought perhaps he was not feeling well. I asked him what was wrong several times, but it wasn't until several hours had passed that he finally opened up to me. He was really sad, and told me that he realized I was not happy with him. He also said that he planned to give me some money so that I could leave, and go wherever it was that I believed I would be happier. I was shocked! I explained to him that I loved him so very much, and that I never meant for him to think that he was the reason for any unhappiness on my part. I felt so bad that I had made him feel that way. He was truly heart broken to think that I was that unhappy and that it was his fault. I told him we have been through so much together, and that I believed it has brought us closer. I apologized for making him feel like he was responsible for my happiness."

We both realized that we have been taking each other for granted and not showing our love and appreciation for each other enough. I am so grateful that we were able to talk about it and that we are able to work on our relationship. We have so much to be thankful for and I am so grateful for him."
