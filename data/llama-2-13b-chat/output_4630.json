        "Summarize the following story in first person: 5 months ago I went on a trip to another state. I had a complicated and hectic work situation--I needed a job. I felt so alone and hopeless at that point in my life--I didn't have anything or anyone to lean on. Or so I thought. Not many of my friends stuck with me after my move, they just faded out of existence; however, a select few still cared. I remember crying and getting a message from a not-very close friend, but a friend nonetheless asking me if I was ok. I was ecstatic. Someone actually CARED about me, and that was one of the best feelings I had gotten in a while. Of course, I responded in the affirmative and updated them on my situation. I realize that friends dont have to be particularly close to be true friends, they just have to be available and care about you as a person to be a true friend, you know? All that matters is that they care about you. When you're down, you dont even have to ask. They'll be there for you, and that's a lovely feeling. I realized what true friendship was after moving. I'll never forget it."
