        "Summarize the following story in first person: I still dream about it sometimes.  The cold water and bottom of the ocean that my feet just couldn't touch.  I still think about the panicked state I was in.  My legs completely cramped up and the side of my right torso also cramped and immobile.  Couldn't move, couldn't stay afloat.  Muscles that weren't cramping up now seizing up because of my more awkward and desperate movements to stay afloat.  Taking on water, choking, vision becoming spotty.  I remember blacking out on the surface, my mind overwhelmed with panic.  But then I remember falling into a comfortable embrace of nothingness.  It was so eternally peaceful.  I thought to myself, \"this is it\", I am dead.  But I felt a presence echo through me, so deeply that my whole body shook.  It said one thing only - \"NO\".   I woke up a day later in the hospital.  I was told I was saved by another surfer who saw me drowning.  Even after 26 months I still dream about it, the drowning, the acceptance of death, and the...something else out there.  The divine something telling me \"no.\"  It's not your time.  I feel truly blessed and protected.  I now search for the reason why I was saved by god.  There must be a reason why I was pulled back."
