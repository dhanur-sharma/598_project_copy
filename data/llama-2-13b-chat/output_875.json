        "Summarize the following story in first person: Dear Diary,Exactly one week ago from today, I won my first match at a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu tournament. Even now, it still feels so surreal to me. Martial Arts was never something I saw myself pursuing professionally. My father owned a dojo, and as a child, I would spend a majority of my weekends training with him. I thought it was a mere hobby to me, more than anything, but my father had always told me that I had the talents to go further. I didn't take his advice, though. The amount of time I spent training, dwindled when I graduated high school and entered college. About a year ago, a friend of mine happened to stumble upon an ad on Facebook about the tournament and brought it to my attention. At that moment, I heard my father's words echo in the back of my head, and I decided to give it a shot! I trained hard for months. It was both the most difficult and rewarding period of my life. There were times where I was on the brink of giving up and dropping out of the tournament completely. At other times, I felt on top of the world and extremely confident. On the days leading up to my first match, I was very nervous. You have no idea how happy I was when I won. Hard work really does pay off! The entire experience was euphoric for me, and I realized that instead of a hobby, Jiu Jitsu, may have been a forgotten passion for me!"
