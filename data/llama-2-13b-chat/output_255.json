        "Summarize the following story in first person: I have always had difficulty dealing with my emotions. For my whole life I dealt with depression and anxiety. High School was not an easy time, having to deal with puberty and emotional instabilities. This all came to a head three months ago. I finally broke down and was unable to function. I stopped talking to people and wasn't able to go into work. I decided to seek out help, and I'm so glad that I did. I never thought that I would be able to feel normal again. I don't know if I will ever be \"normal\", but functioning is good enough for now. If I never sought out help, I don't know what would have happened to me. Best case scenario is that I would have lost my job and a majority of my friends. I don't even want to know what the worst case would have been. Re-acclimating to every day life has been difficult. I take solace in the fact that I actually want to try. I no longer want to curl up in bed and disappear from the world."
