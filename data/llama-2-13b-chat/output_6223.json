        "Summarize the following story in first person: I had a fathers day and birthday party bbq in our yard on Fathers day in June. We invited my grandson who turned 5  for bbq and cake. We had other people over as well. I cooked hamburgers and brauts. Bought a unusually large cake for his birthday. I got him some bugs  for a gift . they were real bugs encased in acrylic. He really loved them and could not stop playing with them as well as his little brother. The food and cake was very good. And we all had fun. I got gifts as well for fathers day. A great light outdoor shirt. it was so fun having everone over and it was a big success. I look forward to the next event we have. The kids and grandkids grow up so fast. We have made this event a tradition in our family. And look forward to doing it again next year."
