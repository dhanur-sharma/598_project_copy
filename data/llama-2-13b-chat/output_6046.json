We went to many restaurants. We went one time to a steakhouse. We both got steaks that night. I got a giant ribeye with some mashed potatoes. She got a small sirloin with some green beans. I had beer with my steak. She had wine with her sirloin. The bill was expensive. Another restaurant we went to was a chicken place. I got a full chicken to eat. She got a half chicken to eat. It was pretty good and juicy. The sad part is is that we broke apart. I miss her. I wish I could see her again and be together once more."
