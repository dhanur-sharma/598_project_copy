        "Summarize the following story in first person: Three months ago I discovered that I'm pregnant. It's really hard to believe. There was a time in my life when I didn't think I would ever want to have kids. I mean, they're just so sticky and smelly and...they just seem like work. But the more I think about it, the more I realize that this might be a gift. Maybe I'm ready for my life to mean something more than...to be about something more than just me, just getting through, just going from one moment to the next. I keep thinking about the future. What it looks like, what's going to happen after I'm gone. I never really thought much about it before, never really thought about the past either for that matter. And now, all of a sudden, it's like time has just opened up before me. I think about the baby inside me. Who are they going to be? Where are they going to end up? How will they change the world. I keep think too about the past, all the people before me who were once children, were once babies growing inside someone's stomach. It makes me dizzy, like looking up at the stars from the top of the mountain--how they just keep going and going. It scares me too, makes me afraid for this little life I'm going to bring into the world. How can I keep them safe? But I'm excited, I'm determined, to make the most of this gift."
