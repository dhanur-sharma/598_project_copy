        "Summarize the following story in first person: It may have only been three weeks ago, but without my little sidekick by my side, it feels like an eternity. I feel like she was just born. I can remember her soft baby skin, her fuzzy hair, and that sweet half-grin all newborns make even though they have yet to grasp the true concept of \"smiling.\" But she's growing up and already in Pre-K. It's a big adjustment for me. Prior to these past few weeks she would follow me around the house everywhere. Now the house is just... empty. And quiet. And being alone---even if for only a few hours a day---makes me incredibly anxious. That first day of Pre-K was rougher on me than her, it seems. She was excited! She effused confidence with every step she took towards her teacher's doorway. I was really surprised to find that *I* was the nervous one needing to hold back tears. I know she'll do great though. She has a spark in her that I truly believe will burst into a blazing flame of success in due time. Hopefully in the meantime I'll learn how to extinguish my nervousness."
