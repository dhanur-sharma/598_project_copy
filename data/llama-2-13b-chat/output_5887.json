        "Summarize the following story in first person: My entry involves how I attained a promotion at my job through hard work and dedication.  I had been working as a salesman at my store for a number of years and always wanted to become a manager there.  I spoke with the manager and he said that there would be positions that would be opened soon so try your best and I would be evaluated.  I did more work than usual for a number of months to strive for a promotion. I helped more customers and took on more responsibilities. I worked in the office such as organizing inventory and organized store promotions.  When the time came, I got the promotion and was grateful.  It showed that hard work pays off and you will be rewarded.  Due to the promotion, I was able to move to a better apartment.  I also was able to afford a new car which helped greatly because I had to rely on taking the bus previously.  I had more responsibilties but I enjoyed it.  I worked with my staff to make the store better.  I instilled my work ethic into my employees.  My promotion gave me confidence to do my job the best possible.  I only wish i would have received a promotion sooner."
