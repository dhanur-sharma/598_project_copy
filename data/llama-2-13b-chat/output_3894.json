        "Summarize the following story in first person: When my oldest daughter was born we brought home a dog and name him, Tucker. Tucker was the name of my first pet. Shortly after I had my first daughter, we decided to get a cat for my second daughter. Tucker always wanted special attention and we couldn't see him sharing that with another dog. Tucker was very protective Labrador that got along with all my daughters friends. Both of my daughters are grown now and married. It was no surprise that they both adopted Labradors and named their dogs Turker1 and Tucker2. All the dogs got along just fine when we had family gathers. My oldest daughter married her best friend, Jane. Jane had a pet poodle.  My second oldest daughter married her high school sweetheart. His name is Tucker. We call him \"T\" for short. Any time he is around and say his full name, her comes our Tucker running to be petted.  About a year ago, Tucker became ill. We thought it was a seasonal cold. He would not eat his gourmet dog food. He would sleep for most of the day and move slowly. I took him to the veterinary and the Vet stated it was just old age and add supplements to Tuckers meals. We did so. Tucker seemed to improve a bit but not completely. Six months later I took Tucker in and the vet ran some test. She found that he had kidney disease and that he would not live for long. 4 months passes and so did Tucker. We had ceremony is my backyard, shedding tears and remembering the life of Tucker."
