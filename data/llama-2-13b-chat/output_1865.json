        "Summarize the following story in first person: June 2019\tThis is the day when I got stuck in a cave named Bat Cave here in Florida. It was memorable and something that I think about often, especially when I go into any other caves and desire to explore passages that are a little tight. Getting stuck in a cave, even thought it was only for about 30 minutes was somewhat terrifying when I think of it. Though I tried to keep my cool and I knew that I would be rescued since there was a large group of people with me, it still makes me think twice every time I see a tight spot in any cave.  With that being said, it began like any other caving trip in Florida, going through various squeezes and crawls into new areas that I have never been before. I followed my friends all the way to the furthest back room that I could reach; they could all fit through without much trouble, and I only had to exhale a little bit to fit through. The back room was interesting, don\u2019t get me wrong, but it was not worth what came next. I tried to fit back through the small opening that I came in through, but going headfirst at such an angle was not going to be the easiest. Seeing another route out that everyone else was going through made me also think that I could just crawl headfirst through that short passage. While I could get my chest and upper body through with no problem, that is where I ran into the problem. My hips just would not fit through! I called to the guys that were with me, who thought I was just joking and soon realized I was not. They pulled my arms to help and I was stuck in tight! They were making slow progress, but it was steady progress. Inch by inch I was able to wiggle my hips while they pulled my arms till finally I got out! It seemed like 30 minutes total, but it was probably much less in real time. After getting out my muscles were shaking all over, but was I ever thankful to get out of the beautiful and somewhat terrifying cave!"
