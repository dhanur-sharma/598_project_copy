I was felt inadequate compared to my pears and I kept my low GPA a secret from my family; of course, that doesn't really mean that I'm a failure. I have a few years to recover, I suppose, so it's all good and well. I'm generally pretty happy, but I still do feel inferior to people I feel are \"smarter\" than me. I guess that's not a mature feeling to really have, but I do want more respect, I guess? My life would be so much easier if people just trusted that I was smart. You know? I just want people to trust my brain. I don't want to tell anyone about my failures because that gives them more ammo to hurt me with, and they have more than enough to hurt me with already. I just want to feel loved, you know? My cousin is a genius. She's an athletic prodigy. She's the perfect kid, basically, and that make's me feel embarrassed I suppose. I just want respect, and I don't get it from anyone. I guess that's fine, though."
