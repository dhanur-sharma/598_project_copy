        "Summarize the following story in first person: I had just gotten my license, and I couldn\u2019t wait to go cruising\u2019 around. I had spent the day at my friend\u2019s house, and now I was on my way home. I was almost home, I just had to turn onto the gravel road to get to my house. While I was turning, I was trying to put in a mix CD I had just made, and trying to turn the corner at the same time. I guess I was going a little too fast, because all of a sudden, I found myself lying in the ditch, outside of my car. I had the bitter taste of blood in my mouth. I was very scared. I slowly got up on one leg and struggled up to the road. There was a man approaching and I waved. It was a man and he called an ambulance. While we were waiting for the ambulance I was hysterical like a child away from home. I couldn\u2019t move or feel my left arm or leg. I felt like I was going to pass out from the pain. The man did everything he could think of to calm me down a little bit. He asked me questions about family, school, and pretty much anything he could think of. The man was braver than me. Later eventually, after what seemed like three hours waiting for the ambulance, it finally got there. The whole way to the hospital they asked me questions about my injuries and on what I remember about the incident. The pain was almost unbearable, so I told enough of what they wanted to hear, just so they\u2019d shut up! They gave me something for the pain. After about 15 minutes in the ambulance we got to the hospital and they hauled me into the X-ray room and took X-rays of my arm and leg. The injury wasn\u2019t too great thank goodness. Besides being alive, that was the best news I had heard all day."
