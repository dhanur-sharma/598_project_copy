        "Summarize the following story in first person: My grandmother passed away suddenly. I wish that I had spent more time with my grandmother. I always seem to put things off that I mean to do and I didn't realize that the loss of my grandmother would be so sudden. I feel so guilty for not spending more time with my grandmother or taking the time just to call and say how are you doing? The funeral was very moving and was attended by family members and friends of my grandmother that I had never met before. My grandmother went on several trips through her church and had numerous friends form her outings.  I talked to several friends of my grandmother and they shared various stories and humorous interactions about my grandmother I never knew. I learned things about my grandmother from her friends that made me feel closer to my grandmother. My grandmother was a special person and had more wonderful qualities to her that I hope to carry on in my life. I consider my grandmother to have been a great role model for myself. I hope I make my grandmother proud in how I carry myself as a person and my actions through life. I have learned from this event in my life  to spend more time with the people I care about and let them know how much they mean to me.  Life is for an indefinite time and we need to make the most of it while we are here. People should not have to live with regrets of things they put off until it was too late. Live every day as if it were your last."
