        "Summarize the following story in first person: About a month ago i was getting ready to go with my wife to visit my sister-and-law for the 4th of July.  I had gotten ready pretty quickly but the wife took a little long as usual. Luckily for me the drive wasn't very far and we hit very little traffic along the way. It was a pretty relaxing drive as they live a bit out of the city so you get a nice view along the way. My wife had prepared some food we kept in a cooler in the backseat that she had made for the party. We arrived at the party a little bit before dinner so that everyone had time to get food prepared and ready. Of course their father was there operating the grill, he always refused to let anyone else do his job at cookouts. He was good at it, though he had a habit of burning the burgers every now and then. My brother-and-law had managed to buy some fireworks as well. They are never as good as the types you see in fireworks shows but he always seems to be super excited about it anyway so everyone just tries to enjoy his \"Show\". We were all surprised to see he actually managed to get a hold of a few pretty big fireworks. I wasn't even sure if those were legal to own here. Overall we had a great time eating some food with the family and celebrating the holiday together. We left around 10 and made our way home, again we were lucky enough to avoid any traffic despite it being 4th of July weekend, I must take an unconventional route. I look forward to doing it again next year."
