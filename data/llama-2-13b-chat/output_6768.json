They said that my supervisor said I hadn't' cleaned the hood, and after like 10 minutes of us running around and me poking holes in the stories they were spouting I got my shit and left. It was pretty funny actually, they like expected me to be sad or something. The HR guy was on the line through a remote location. They basically just sat me down and said I didn't clean the hood. I told them that yes I did, and told them they should look to whatever day I cleaned the bins. Then I asked when they were asking people if I cleaned if they asked my other coworker. They said they had not. When I asked to review the tapes myself, the tapes didn't exist anymore. Like seriously how sketchy is that lol. I was so mad just about that really. Also they noted the hood was dirty 22 days after I supposedly cleaned it. They addressed it to me almost 45 days after I cleaned it. And by the time they were firing me over it, the tape didn't exist. what a bunch of malarkey, really."
