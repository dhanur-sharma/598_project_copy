        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was on my birthday party when my girlfriend broke my heart. I went to work as usual and because I had a busy day. No one wished me a happy birthday during the day and I thought everyone had forgotten my birthday. My friends organized a party that was to happen in the house so when I left work, I went home as usual only to find out a surprise party for me which made me so happy and appreciative. We were having a good time with my friends and everyone was  having a good time. The music was loud and everyone was taking alcohol while laughing and chatting with each other.  I decided to walk around the house and I could not believe what I saw .My girlfriend was kissing another guy who is my friend and I got so speechless that I did not know what to tell her. It was a big shock because I did not expect that from her even though she was so intoxicated. I stormed out of the house and she ran after me calling out my name but I did not want to stop. Everyone stared at us wondering what had happened and some of my friends followed me to find out what had happened to me. I told them what had happened and they were so disappointed in my friends behavior. We then decided to take the party to a night club where I took so much alcohol to forget the incident. It was the most heartbreaking moment in my life and I could not help but to see the images of that betrayal throughout the night. I could not understand why they had betrayed me that much. Thank God my friends were there to help me go through that sad moment. I felt so bad about what my friend did to me but later on I decided to move on and forget the incident that was the most painful moment in my life. I have now decided to forget the sad moment."
