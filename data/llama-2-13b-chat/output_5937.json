        "Summarize the following story in first person: It's been a while since I wrote here. Ten months exactly, and about ten months ago something happened that I need to let my feelings out about. I went to a party hosted by my friend Max. He's a really social guy, but I didn't realize how many friends he had. The party was wild and packed. SO many people showed up I couldn't have counted them if I wanted to. This made me pretty jealous for some reason. Since then, I haven't been able to be as close to Max as I once was. He's one of my only friends! Yet, he has so many friends outside of me. Do I even really matter to him? I don't know anymore. It messes with my head and so I prefer to just avoid him nowadays. Last week, he invited me to another party. I did NOT go!"
