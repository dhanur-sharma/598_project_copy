I was going to the auditorium because my supervisor said that she had a surprise to me tell me about. She told me to meet her at the auditorium when i finished my lunch. I ate lunch with a coworker of mine and after finished, we headed straight to the auditorium. I thought it was only going to be and my super visor but my other coworkers were there as well. They all looked really happy to see me and i saw my supervisor standing on stage. She told me to head up there with her. When i got up there, she told me that i was going to get a promotion. All my coworkers burst out into cheers and claps. I almost felt like tearing up when i got the news. I worked really hard to get the promotion and i felt like i really deserved it. After the auditorium incident, my supervisor also handed me a small gift. It contained a  little key chain. It was a small token of appreciation for all i have done for the company. Once i got home, i was still shocked about what happened."
