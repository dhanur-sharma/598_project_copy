        "Summarize the following story in first person: The worst day of my life is when I lost one of my best friends my grandpa. He was so close to me. I always used to share all kind of stories with him. I used to share my happiness and sadness with him. He was the best person to share all type of difficulties because he had so much experience so he would guide you through the right directions for sure. The day he passed away I was out of town for some business purpose and that was the first time that I was leaving him for about two weeks or so. However, when I left him, he was perfectly fine and was healthy as well. He had no health issues whatsoever. I was so impressed with his diet and the style that he lived his life. In addition to that, I called him couple times while I was away but suddenly, he had a heart attack and my family took him to the Emergency. He fought with his life in ICU for couple hours before he died. As soon as I found out about this, I went straight to the airport, but the flights were delayed for couple hours due to incremental weather. However, I took the first flight and went straight to the hospital, but it was too late. I could not meet him in his last time. I still regret about this and perhaps will never forgive myself and will never forget that incident."
