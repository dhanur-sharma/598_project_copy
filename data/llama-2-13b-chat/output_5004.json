        "Summarize the following story in first person: Life is full of unexpected events, my life has been no different. About ten months ago I found out my significant other was pregnant,  I knew a new adventure was about to begin for me. As the weeks rolled by, the due date was coming closer and closer, and time seemed to move quicker too. I knew I was going to need lots of baby stuff, and a lot more money. I immediately started saving money, as well as working many more hours. Saving money wasn't the only hurdle I was going to have to overcome,  I also needed to move many hours away from where I was raised, and where my business was located. About a month before the due date my significant other decided that I could finally move up to where she was, I did not delay, and moved as quickly as I could. It took me three trips to move all of the baby stuff, and another trip to move my necessary belongings. Upon arriving,  I immediately setup the nursery for our soon to  arrive daughter. There were many other things to prepare,  like child proofing the house, and making sure that we were ready. I made tons of food, and froze them into individual servings, ensuring we would have proper caloric intake upon our return. I also made sure that our vehicles were in top operating condition. Before we knew it,  we were driving to the hospital. After two long days, our beautiful daughter was in our arms. It was the happiest day in my life,  and the beginning of my new family. A few days later we were able to go home, and start a new chapter of our lives."
