        "Summarize the following story in first person: Today was a very exciting and wonderful day! Although my birthday is coming up in a couple of weeks, I really hadn't put much thought into it at all. I know Billy won't be here, and to be honest at my age birthdays don't really mean much anyway. So, here's what happened. We were all sitting down eating supper and Billy called. He talked to Veronica, who hung up the phone and told me something was going on and we were to meet him in the driveway. I put on my shoes, and followed her out to wait for him to arrive. After about 20 minutes, I heard what I thought was his motorcycle coming up the driveway. Sure enough, it was him. I was so concerned about what was going on I didn't even see what was happening right in front of my eyes. There he was, sitting on the bike right in front of me, grinning from ear to ear; It was MY bike!!! The one I had designed and was in the works for over 2 years!! I had no idea he had even been working on it and here it was, finished and in all its glory! It was gorgeous. Painting in black and my favorite shade of blue, lowered almost all the way to the ground, and sounding like a beast! Harley Davidson custom at it's finest! I was absolutely elated. Billy sat there with a shit-eating grin from one ear to the other, knowing he was a champion. He told me Happy Birthday, and that he loved me very much. He wanted me to have a very special birthday present this year because he wasn't going to be able to be here for my birthday, and felt terrible about it. I love this man! He is such a fantastic, loving, and supportive husband. To think he went out of his way to work so hard for weeks to get this project finished just to make me happy and see me smile. I am still very sad that he won't be here for my special day, but I have to admit he cushioned the blow a great deal with this fabulous surprise. I knew years ago he was the person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with and I was right. He is my heart and my soul, and I can't imagine life without him. Happy birthday to me!"
