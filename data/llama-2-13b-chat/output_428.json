        "Summarize the following story in first person: A few months ago, I was given a promotion and a raise at my job. This is a very important milestone for me because I am still relatively young and haven't been at my current employer for very long. However, my bosses felt that it was time to give me more responsibility and more money for the work that I have done for them so far. More importantly, because I am still young, it shows that I am gaining a growing reputation in my field. I work in a relatively large area in terms of population, but my field isn't very big. Most people who work in the field know one another and word spreads quickly. In the time I've with my current employer, I've already met many of my counterparts at other organizations. I've also met many of the owners and supervisors of other organizations in the field. Getting a promotion and more recognition so quickly will allow me to have more options if I decide to leave my job. Additionally, it made me feel good that I was able to impress my bosses. Many young employees don't get the opportunity that I've gotten so far so it was important that I made a good impression. I've found that people appreciate my work ethic and my hard work, which are two things that are important to me. I've come along way since college and it wasn't the easiest road, so to be working in and excelling in my field is an important sign of who I am as a professional. I intend to take this on and continue making my bosses pleased with the decision to hire me in the coming months. I also intend to see if it has impressed people outside of my organization for other potential opportunities."
