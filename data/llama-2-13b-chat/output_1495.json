        "Summarize the following story in first person: When my daughter started Pre-K, I think I was much more scared than she was. I had her a bit older in life, when I was in my 40's. It had taken my husband and I a long time to conceive. So, I suppose I babied her a bit. I didn't mean to, but that was just the way it was. She was very excited to start school. We went shopping together for her school supplies and she had a great time. In fact, I couldn't get her to take her backpack off for the rest of the day. She kept asking me when she got to start school. Finally, when the day came, she woke me up early because she was so excited. I was feeling a bit downhearted about sending her off into the work. But, we walked to school together, and she chattered the whole way they. I ran into a few other neighborhood parents on the way, and could tell some of them were also feeling the same way. It's hard when you send off your first, one mom of 3 knowingly told me. I tried to fight back tears. We went to the classroom and I dropped my daughter off, she hugged me goodbye and then I was on my way. I realized though that I had taught her well, and that she would do fine in school."
