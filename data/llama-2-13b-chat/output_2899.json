        "Summarize the following story in first person: I have had a terrible breakup about 5 months ago. It was with my recent ex, and it was because she was cheating on me. I didn't suspect her at first, but little things built up over time that made it impossible to ignore. For instance, she wouldn't be as affectionate with me as she used to be at the start of our relationship. I could understand if she was cranky a few times a week and didn't want anyone hoovering over her or touching her, but this attitude of her towards me became a daily occurrence. What finally broke the dam for me was when she and I got into it when I tried to talk with her. She got angry and bitchy with me, saying that she didn't want to. I dropped it despite being so frustrated. Later that night, I woke out to go to the bathroom and saw he on the couch in the living room giggling like a school girl while on he phone. This sudden and rapid shift in mood was striking, so I asked he who she was on the phone with. I obviously caught her by surprise, and she tried to switch the conversation and hide her phone. I didn't  fall for her distractions and asked again who she was on the phone with, but that just gone her mad. She yelled at me and stormed out of the apartment. To next day, I got a call from her say we were through. I demanded her to tell me why, and she said she was hooking back up with her ex. I suspect that was who she was on the phone with the night before, and it would also explain her change in attitude towards me the weeks leading up to this. Sad that it ended the way that it did, but I'd rather it end quickly than to be in a miserable relationship."
