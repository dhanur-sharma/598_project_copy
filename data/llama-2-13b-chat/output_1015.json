        "Summarize the following story in first person: Let me backtrack a bit prior to this all happening.  I was in my mid 30s and all my friends had already started to settle down. Some had even married and started families. I was becoming the odd one out still being single and no kids. Add to that I was just really beginning to get a good foothold in my career. As I saw it, I needed to propel myself forward significantly in 2019 if I wanted to feel like I was progressing and not becoming \u201clife stagnant\u201d. So I took upon myself to get out from renting a small apartment nearby work and took the leap of faith to home ownership. I should have done this a few years ago.  I think what held me back was the fear of the whole process, but with the realtor I found and the information on the web I researched, it wasn\u2019t as painful as I anticipated.  It was honestly easier than all the troubles that I\u2019ve been through over the years with renting. Some of those troubles were bad building managers, terrible neighbors, and sketchy areas I\u2019ve lived in.  Now I feel like I\u2019m putting down roots in my community and making a solid plan of moving forward. I'm glad I finally took that leap of faith. Too many times I questioned myself and my motivations. In the long run, there was nothing really much to fear. Having those keys in my hand really made me feel like a grown-up. And also, now my parents can also get off my back about not \u201cgrowing up\u201d."
