        "Summarize the following story in first person: The night my fourth baby was born was extremely exciting and unexpected.  I was thirty six weeks and six days pregnant and not anticipating to have him for a few more weeks.  I have my fourth c-section scheduled already.  I was sitting at home with my husband and I noticed that I did not feel him moving as much as he normally did at night.  I got worried and called the doctor and they wanted me to go in to the hospital for monitoring.  I went in and they kept me overnight and monitored his heartrate.  His heart kept dropping which was really concerning so first thing that morning they decided to go ahead and do a c-section for his safety.  There was a lot of build up to that point where they weren't sure what they were going to do.  They kept rushing in the room every time his heart rate would drop and it was really scary to me.  I just wanted to be sure my baby was okay.  Finally they came in and announced they were going to go ahead with the surgery.  I was really nervous and excited because I had left home with just my purse and had no idea I'd be having surgery and finally meeting my little baby the next morning, but I couldn't wait to have him in my arms plus I was worried about his safety because of what was going on.  Everything happened really fast after that and within an hour or so they were pulling him out and I heard his little cries and they brought him to me so I could see his little face for the first time.  My husband wasn't there with me in the operating room so the anesthesiologist sat right beside me and held him beside me so I could see him while they finished the surgery. It turns out he had a full knot in his umbilical cord which apparently is really rare but can be very dangerous for the baby.  It was very fortunate that I had come in to be monitored and the doctor had decided to go ahead with the c-section.  I went to recovery and sat there just examining his little face and falling in love with him for the first time.  I stayed in the hospital with him for a few days and then was finally able to go home and introduce him to my other three children and my husband.  I still cherish that time in the hospital with him where it was just the two of us one on one and I finally had him in my arms.  To me he is my little miracle baby.  He's four months old now and sitting on my lap right now as I type this.  He is Such a sweet little cutie."
