        "Summarize the following story in first person: After my divorce, I felt sad, lost, and heartbroken. I always thought I would be married to my first wife. She was my first love and I was very much attracted to her. The 16 years without her I was just bumbling through life. My life was mainly work and video games. I had one friend and we barely hung out. One day after work, I decided to try an online dating site. I was extremely nervous making a profile and felt a little too old to be on one of these sites. However, I still gave it a try. After a week I got matched up. We decided to meet at a restaurant close to me. When I got there, I saw that she was even more beautiful than the picture made her out to be. We talked all night about our hobbies and what we do for a living, then parted ways. After that, we were talking daily. After 2 years, I proposed to her and a year after that we got married. I never thought my heart could take one a responsibility this huge again, but it did. I really hope this one lasts and that my life will have a happy ending."
