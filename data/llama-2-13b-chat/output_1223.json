        "Summarize the following story in first person: Two months ago, I attended a rally for presidential candidate, Andrew Yang. He instilled belief in me about the future of the country. One thing I really admired about Andrew Yang was his concern for my local county and the people that reside within it. He has made every effort to address poverty across county lines and speak to us about the rising opiod epidemic that's sweeping our nation. Not only that, he found ample time to speak about the dangers of climate change that we are currently experiencing today. He began with a very inspiring speech about how it was time to change our country and led us into a discussion about poverty within our city. He spoke about how it was unfair that so many sat within the streets, hungry and poor, while other's indulge on their riches and how that needed to change. He then went on to speak about climate change and how we needed to act today to ensure that our children won't have to deal with a failing planet when it's their turn to lead the world. Rising temperatures have been adding to our sea level which, within the next 50 years, will affect our children and our children's children, which is why we need to work to reduce emissions to have a clean Earth for them in the future. Lastly, he began to speak about how the opiod crisis is even affecting our county and the evidence is mounting that these people need mental treatment instead of constant arrests. They need to be cared for instead of shunned and we need to put ourselves in there places if we are to see exactly what they are going through. He also spoke about the actions of Washington and spoke about how it was important for us to not fall into that trap of hate and bigotry and instead lighten the world with our actions. How instead of shipping Mexican's back to there home country, that we will instead create a pathway to citizenship for these individuals so there kids aren't trapped in the very situation that they were running away from. He also spoke of the importance of culture within America and how that would be going against everything that we stand against. I left his rally feeling refreshed and rejuvenated, but also with a new respect for many of the issues that we face today."
