        "Summarize the following story in first person: I went to California for a vacation a few weeks ago. I went to visit some family, but mainly to relax a little. You know how stressed I have been? That's why I needed the vacation. I thought that the Hotel Del Coronado looked like a great place to go and relax so I got a few nights there. When I checked in, I was told that I might hear some things and to ignore them. I asked \"What kind of things?\" and the hotel clerk said \"Just footsteps, laughing, ghost noises.\" I laughed and ignored that. I don't believe in ghosts so whatever. That night, I was laying in bed after taking a shower and had just turned the tv off. I got comfy and started to doze off when I heard a ball bouncing. I opened my eyes and the noise stopped. I flipped over and saw nothing so I assumed it was my imagination. I closed my eyes again and hear a child laughing and the ball bouncing again. I sat up and turned the light on. There was nothing there. I thought back to the clerk telling me about the noises. I was a skeptic, but that night I think I believe in ghosts now."
