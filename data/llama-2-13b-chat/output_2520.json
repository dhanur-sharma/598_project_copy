        "Summarize the following story in first person: It is a policy at work that no one should be caught watching sexual or pornographic materials on work computers. Recently, I caught a coworker  watching pornographic clips on his work computer. I noticed that the coworker was late in presenting his work to our group and went to ask why. When I arrived at his desk he was busy watching pornographic videos. I had to bang his desk to notify him that I was around. I asked politely about the report and that is when he started shouting at me. This alerted the supervisor who came fast and found the coworker still talking to me. The video clips were playing on his work computer all along. The supervisor took the case to management and the coworker was relived of his duties immediately. After a week, the coworker was rehired after he threatened to sue the company. The company fearing on the bad image the story might bring, they hired him back. Funny enough, he was given a managerial position, a position I should have been promoted to. Because the company had already promoted one person to the managerial position, I was forced to wait for another year to see whether I can be promoted. I wonder how is this even possible. Someone who should be terminated is now literally my boss. I do not know how I am going to submit reports to him knowing I was technically the reason he got fired. I feel like resigning. This world can be unfair."
