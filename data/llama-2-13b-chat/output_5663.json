        "Summarize the following story in first person: This event is concerning when I was baptized as a Jehovah's witness. It happened in April and I still relish and remember that day. It has taken me about two years of continuous study of the Bible to finally be approved for baptism. I was very happy when the elders told me that I was approved for baptism. I told all my friends and family. I had not been baptized at any church in my life except when I was a child and so I was determined to make this day a memorable one. I asked all the questions I could ask about it and felt anxious when the day arrived. During the baptism, a baptismal talk was given and we were told to answer two questions. After that, we all lined up to present ourselves at the baptismal pool. I was nervous as I went to the pool and was dipped into the water. The dipping into the water signifies that I have been dead to my former course of life and was reborn to a new life with service to Jehovah in mind. I celebrated the day with friends and family. After the baptism, I held a party for my friends and family. The party was held at my home and I gave a talk on the significance of the day for me. I was then asked questions by those present and they gave me advice on how to make a success of my new resolve to serve Jehovah. The day ended by my giving a little prayer to Jehovah that I would do his will all the days of my life."
