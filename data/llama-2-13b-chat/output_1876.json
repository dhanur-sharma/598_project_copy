        "Summarize the following story in first person: Four months ago my father died. I haven't been able to sleep since. My father was a very healthy man. He did things like eat healthy, exercise weekly, and went for regular routine check ups with his doctor. If I told me before he died that he wouldn't die of \"old age\" I wouldn't have believed you. My father was kind, caring, and very instrumental to my upbringing. I know that tomorrow is never promised to any of us and at any moment a \"freak accident\" could happen and just like that any of us could be gone. Up until now because it personally never happened to me I didn't really believe it could happen to me. My father was on a run around his surrounding neighborhood like he normally does every week. Unfortunately what my father didn't know was that on this particular day there was a robbery that took place in one of the boarding neighborhoods that he runs through. My father vaguely fit the description of the man who robbed the neighbor so police mistook my father for the robber. The police apparently gave my father instructions to stop running and show his hand but my father had a hoodie on and under the hoodie he had in headphones so he did not hear the polices orders. He eventually saw one of the neighbors motioning towards him to turn around so my father did. My father had his cell phone in his hand and the police claimed they thought it was a gun so they shot my father and he died at the scene. Eventually the police realized they had the wrong man but the damage was already done. Now I fear the police and even going outside my home. The police department has apologized but their apology will not bring back my father. I'm filled with emptiness, anger, and hurt so I lay awake every night since then because when I sleep I relive that day over again."
