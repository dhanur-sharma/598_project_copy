        "Summarize the following story in first person: Yeah I had a fear of roller coasters. I tagged along with a group of friends to Dorney Park. I was very reluctant but I went anyway. While there I avoided as much rides as I could but eventually my friends noticed and exposed me. I still resisted and went into defence mode until a close friend of mine gave me some words of encouragement that made me take the jump. I can't remember what they had said for some reason but I ended up enjoying myself a whole lot. Nothing can prepare you for the feeling you have when you're in a roller coaster. When you plunge down at high speeds, death almost feels inevitable. The force against your chest and the anxiety is so overwhelming. You have to go in with absolute faith in human machinery which is blind and foolish faith. Somehow the fear is what made the experience for me. After facing my fear and doing it anyway, I expected the worst. I think also looking around and seeing the looks on other people's faces made me feel better. Some were more scared than me it seemed and some were having an absolute blast. I chose to emulate the latter."
