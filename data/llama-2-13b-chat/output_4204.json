        "Summarize the following story in first person: When I was growing up I could not stand dealing with this person. We really didn't get a long very well in school to the point that we had become rivals even though we were of opposite genders. We would go out of our ways to mess with each other and just do things to make the others life more difficult while we were going to school together. As we got older and popularity in high school mattered we would do things to mess with the other in that regard to. I felt like this rivalry between us would never end because he would always end up getting the better of me when it came to our little wars of words going back and forth. When I graduated from high school I figured that this rivalry would likely end because of everyone going their separate ways and low and behold this one did not. He was still in my life as we had some mutual friends and he would be at some of the same places that I was heading to. I felt like at this point it was best to really try to bury the hatchet with this guy. We had been feuding with each other since we were in elementary school so I really felt like it was time to just try to settle this and move on to something else to let us both go on with your lives like we are true adults. When I first attempted to do this he just kinda laughed and acted like there was no way this had any chance of ever happening. So I decided that this just wasn't going to happen at this point in time and just let it go. After that I didn't see him for a little while and wondered what had happened. I almost felt concerned because even though how we felt about each other I had known him for a long time and didn't want anything bad to happen. I finally saw him again about 4 months ago and I asked him where he had been. He explained that he had a few bad things come up in life that he had to take care of so he didn't really have time to go to parties and just hang out anymore. I felt like he was in a bad place so I asked him to dinner with me and he said ok. When we could just sit down and talk together we really hit it off with one another right away. I feel like this was truly a day that changed my life as today we are together and looking to get married. When we really got to know each other we realized that we were a perfect match and maybe the reason we didn't get a long all those years ago was because we were just to much alike so it caused friction between us. I am truly grateful that we got to sit down and realize that we we're meant to be together."
