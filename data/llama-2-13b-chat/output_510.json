        "Summarize the following story in first person: I moved in with my girlfriend after much house hunting together. We finally decided on an affordable spot that wasn't too far away from our previous homes, and we moved in together. This was my first time ever living with a romantic partner, and also her first time as well. In addition, it was a new experience in that we did not have an HOA. Both of us were used to living in one, and having to pay dues for that as well as follow a color scheme. I loved that I no longer had to conform to the rules and regulations of a seemingly pointless organization. To celebrate this, my partner and I decided to explore the area to find things to decorate our new yard with. We found an old school nursery nearby, (even the main business sign was a big piece of hand painted wood), and we bought some plants. Well, about 18 plants to be exact, and all but two of them were fruit or vegetable producing. So we planted these outside in our new yard to harvest. Besides the lack of HOA, we also didnt have to worry about pet fees, which was another thing neither of us were used to. Naturally, we had to celebrate this as well. Instead of a traditional dog or cat, we ended up getting 5 pets. These include 2 leopard geckos (one albino one regular), a veiled chameleon, a roboroverski hamster, and a havana rabbit. It's felt so freeing and wonderful living with my life partner, and being able to experience our new place the way we really want to."
