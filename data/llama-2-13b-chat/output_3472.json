        "Summarize the following story in first person: Myself, my husband, and my son were out in the front yard in the summer time. I was bent over with my back facing the road pulling weeds out of the front landscaping in front of the house. My son and my husband were playing catch with the football. The ball went over the embankment so they were standing there, looking down at it. All of a sudden, I heard this big crash, I turned around and saw this old classic red convertible car with the top down come barreling down the road sideways. I realized it hit the guardrail and lost control and he was trying to regain control of the car again as it came sideways down the curved road in front of my house. My life flashed in front of my eyes and I quickly glanced around for my 1 year old son and husband, that's when I saw them by the side of the yard. I got up and ran toward them. The car skidded to a stop just before the car's tires hit the grass in my yard. The man driving the car had a stunned look on his face. My husband then yelled \"he's got a beer in his hand!!\". The guy then took off down the road. I ran inside the house to call 911 and report that someone was drinking and driving, hit the guard rail and almost flipped his convertible car into my yard. The cops later showed up at our house and explained they didn't find any beer in his car, but did get him for a DUI. I ended up getting subpoenaed for it a while later, but they dismissed me the day of the trial and didn't need me to testify."
