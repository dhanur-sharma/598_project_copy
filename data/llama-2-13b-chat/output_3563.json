        "Summarize the following story in first person: Daisy is sitting in the back of the bus. She is enjoying the ride and looking out the window. The bus then abruptly stops and she was thrown forward in her seat. Fred then walks on to the bus and sees, that the only seat left is the one next to Daisy. Fred sat down with a huff and he began to make himself comfortable. The bus then began to move and they were back on the road. For the next hour of the ride, Daisy was looking out the window until, Fred turns to her and says that his name is Fred. This takes Daisy by surprise and causes Daisy to become a little more happy about the whole thing. Even though it was a better reaction,than she got the first time she still did not trust Fred so she just ignored him. She waited about 10 minutes and felt bad for avoiding Fred so she turned his way. She suddenly notice that he was sleeping before she could asking him a few questions. With this now known, Daisy happily fell asleep knowing that she had made a new friend. A half an hour later, Daisy woke up to the sound of the road. Daisy sat up straight and found Fred reading his newspaper. Throughout art history there have been many artists who refer back to mythological figures and tales as artistic inspiration. Mythological stories, as well as the ideas of classic history, became increasingly reverted back to with the start of Neoclassicism. Rationality and tradition were rediscovered and implemented into artwork more frequently in the mid-eighteenth century; these key thoughts made up the ideals of Neoclassicism; the classical revival in European art. One of the great artists of the time was Baron Francois Gerard, whose oil painting of Cupid and Psyche in 1798 represented a true masterpiece of the Neoclassical period due to its overall focus on the main characters in the narrative while integrating powerful symbolism and creating a high quality of realism. Baron Francois Gerard\u2019s 1798 painting of Cupid and Psyche portrays Psyche sitting on a grassy hill-like area. She is shown with a very vacant and far-off gaze as if observing something in the distance. Her posture is relaxed yet her arms are almost in a folded position over her bare body. Cupid is right next to her and has his arms wrapped around her carefully as to not touch her. His gaze is right at her face and has a look of longing in his eyes. Cupid carries his set of arrows around his right arm between his golden falcon wings."

This painting is a perfect example of how artists of the Neoclassical period looked to the mythological past for inspiration, and how they were able to revive the classical ideals of art in their own works. As the 19th century progressed, artists continued to look to mythology as inspiration for their artwork. The Pre-Raphaelite movement, for example, was heavily influenced by mythological stories and the works of Shakespeare. The Pre-Raphaelite artists sought to create art that was beautiful, detailed, and emotionally powerful, and they often turned to mythology for inspiration. One of the most famous Pre-Raphaelite artists was Dante Gabriel Rossetti, who painted a number of works inspired by mythology, including \"The Blessed Damozel\" and \"Proserpine\". These paintings featured beautiful, dreamlike landscapes and figures, and were characterized by their attention to detail and their use of vibrant, symbolic colors. In addition to Rossetti, other notable Pre-Raphaelite artists included John Everett Millais, William Holman Hunt, and Edward"
