        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last week had to be one of the hardest in my life. As it is usually just my son and I home we have things down to a 't' when it comes to our schedule but his grandma was home which messed things up a bit. Not only for him but for me too. She's a lot harder to entertain versus a 10 month old. But I had let her take him in with her and she was making her bed. This bed is a good 4 feet off the ground mind you. She decided to put him on top of it and when she was on the other side my poor baby had fallen off. So of course I rush in with my heart beating out of my chest because he was crying so bad. She was trying to explain but I didn't want to hear none of it, I just wanted my baby to be okay. I eventually got him calm and he went to sleep but when he woke and started back in on crying again I knew something wasn't right. I was so angry at her for hurting him though she didn't intentionally hurt him. I still blamed her because I thought how could you not be more careful? You know your bed is a mountain compared to this baby, you know he moves fast! How, how, how did you not think that this would have happened before it did. So we took him to the doctors and this poor little 10 month old is already in to get x-rays. I was devastated, embarrassed and so, so sorry for my little guy. Turns out he got a small fracture to the wrist. So they put a cast on him for 3 weeks and they said the bone will be stronger than it was before since he is so young. It was reassuring but it sure didn't make me feel any better about the situation. Yeah, last week sucked."
