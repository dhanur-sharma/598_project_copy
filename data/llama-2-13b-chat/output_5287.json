        "Summarize the following story in first person: The job I currently have moves me around quite a bit. Every few years I know a move is coming and I prepare myself for another relocation. I have a family to worry about now but my son and my wife know this is a part of my job. My son is still young but old enough to at least understand that when I tell him we have to move somewhere else because of my job he knows what that means. I'm not far away from retirement but I am sure I have a few moves left before I can call it quits. I know my wife is good with the moving but I am not sure what the effects will be on my son when he gets older. He has never said anything to me or my wife but as of right now I can only assume that he likes moving. He has a few friends but he has done well making new friends wherever we have moved. I had been informed a couple of months ago that me and my family would be relocating to Texas. Texas was a place that we had never lived and we were all looking forward to moving there. About five weeks ago while I was at work I was told that I was not relocating and that I can and/or need to stay where I was. I wasn't sure how to feel about this because I was already in a routine and I had already told my family we were moving. I sat them down when I got home from work and told them what happened. My wife was supportive but my son simply said okay. That evening when I went to say goodnight to my son, he had his art pad by his night stand and it was open. I looked at the page it was on it he had written (I am very happy.) After seeing that I gave him a big hug and told him goodnight. I was really happy to see that he had wrote that because now I knew how he felt and that he was happy to stay where we were."
