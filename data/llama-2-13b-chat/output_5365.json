        "Summarize the following story in first person: I worked for many years. Some of those years were at this company and some were not. I can say for certain that I am enjoying retirement. The phone call from my former company was very unexpected and flattering but unwelcome in some ways. I like having the freedom in my life to not have to worry about work or managing a group. I already have vacations planned and am looking forward to starting some of those hobbies that I neglected for many years when I was too busy working. That's the thing about work, especially the kind of work I did. Everything was SO important that it too priority over anything else in my life. I was at work into the night and worked many holidays and weekends. I don't want to live like a slave to my employer. I feel like there are precious few moments in life and now that I am retired I want to enjoy them. So yea, I told the company no thank you. I do not have any regrets about this. I am looking forward in my life and not looking back. Those hobbies and those moments are my priority now."
