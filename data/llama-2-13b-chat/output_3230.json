        "Summarize the following story in first person: Our first family trip to Walt Disney World resort in Orlando, Florida was amazing and memorable. Watching my 5 year olds face light up at the sight of his favorite character (Stitch) is something I will never forget. The food was memorable for a different reason. On our fourth night of vacation, we ate at a restaurant called \"Chef Mickey's\" in the Contemporary resort. My wife had researched a lot for our trip and had warned me that we weren't going for a fabulous food experience as she had booked this restaurant solely for the purpose of the character experience for our son. Chef Mickey's is a buffet restaurant that features the \"fab 5,\" Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Pluto, and Goofy. It is an easy way to meet the characters without waiting in long lines in the parks. After being seated, we browsed the expansive buffet that winded around the restaurant. I marveled at the open concept of the restaurant which enabled patrons to view the monorails as they traveled through the hotel a few floors above. It is a quite impressive space. The food was typical buffet fare. I had low expectations so I was not bothered despite the steep price we paid. My wife and I decided to nibble on some boiled shrimp and have a cocktail then pick up a hamburger later on that evening because we were underwhelmed by the selections. My son enjoyed his selections of chicken and broccoli and the characters and then we returned to the parks. Before the fireworks even began that night, my wife and I both started feeling very ill. We spent the next day in our hotel room very, very sick. Luckily, my son did not catch anything. Our hotel desk was amazing and sent a doctor to our room. We were able to salvage the last two days of our vacation for our son's sake and we plan on going back next year but we will definitely never again eat at Chef Mickey's."
