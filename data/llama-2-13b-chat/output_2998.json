        "Summarize the following story in first person: An event that happened to me recently that I will never forget was August 18 2019 my favorite auntie passed away unexpectedly. I've never been really close to my family besides my grandmother and she passed away 9 years ago. What hurts the most with my aunt passing is that I did not make a way to go and see her and now she is gone. We would talk briefly and she would express her want to come and visit and me being a hermit I chose to never partake in any visit thus I never got to see her. We held a memorial service for her Saturday and things just did not seem right one minute she was here and the next she was gone. I never got to tell her I love her or how much fun we had together or even thank you for the times she let me and my daughter stay and we could've been homeless. Me and my aunt ann was a lot closer than me and my other aunties and I now have to live with the fact she is gone and I have so much to say and it's too late to say it. Now I feel alone my grandma and aunt always had my back  more than my mother she has always made a difference in her kids I've never felt love and now I feel like I won't feel love ever given my aunt Is gone. I have always cherished family and my auntie did too now many of the things we did as a family won't happen because she is gone. I can't even imagine how my cousin feel about this I know what I feel about it and have yet to accept the truth. I want to go into a bubble and never come out after this event it is hitting my heavy. I feel soulless and helpless like I have no where to turn to. I feel like giving up on the world and letting go I just want to say forget it. Her unexpected death leaves me with too many questions that has gone unanswered. Her death makes me reflect on my own life and how to make it better."
