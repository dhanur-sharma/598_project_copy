        "Summarize the following story in first person: My father and I got in an argument about a friend of his who sexually harassed me when I was younger. He mentioned the friend in casual conversation after I had asked him several times to no longer talk about him. This caused a serious argument between us, during which he accused me of \"going off the deep end\". He used my mental health issues (anxiety and depression) as ammunition in this argument. His use of my mental health to support his position really hurt my feelings for several reasons. The most important of those reasons being that he and I had begun sharing our mental health issues with each other. Our issues had not been something we have been able to really discuss in the past. I thought we had reached a point where I would be able to share things with him and we could understand each other in that way. The \"friend\" in question never really did anything serious enough to me to warrant getting the law involved, but it had bothered me for several years. In years past, my father was aware of the issues and stopped being friends with the person in question. I am not sure why he suddenly decided that what the \"friend\" did wasn't an issue anymore. It really hurt my feelings that he seemed to have decided that my feelings were no longer important. He claimed I should get over it because it had been several years since the incidents happened. I tried to explain to him that I was mostly over the past incidents, but it was difficult to not think about him when the person in question was brought up on a regular basis. This didn't really seem to matter to him. Instead, he was more interested in doing whatever he could to not think about this problem. I am still not sure how our relationship will be fixed, even after all this time."
