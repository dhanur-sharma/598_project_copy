        "Summarize the following story in first person: About six months ago, my ex broke into my friend's garage, because he had been looking for me all night and couldn't find where I was.  At the time, we had lived apart for over 3 years, but he remained obsessed with me. I was with my boyfriend that night, and in the morning stopped at my friend's house before going home.  My friend's garage was opened about 2 feet, and I was sitting in the garage waiting for her to get back from picking our friend up at the Amtrak station.  I was looking down at my phone when suddenly my ex was on the ground, on his stomach, sliding under the garage door.  He grabbed me and asked where i had been all night, and started pleading and begging me to tell him.  I didn't tell him where I was or who  I was with because it was nine of his business.  He then switched gears completely, and suddenly got very angry.  He was still holding me by my upper arms, when he slammed me down on the ground on top of something piled up in the garage.  Whatever it was he slammed me down on, had a peg sticking out of it, and it felt like it went straight through me, straight through my organs.  My first thought was a couple more blows like that and I would be dead.  As I got up I realized I suddenly couldn't breathe very well, and I said \"You really hurt me.\"  He didn't seem to hear me though, and so I sat down on the chair to catch my breath.  He was still angry and he hit me in the face, afterwards saying, \"please dont call the police.\"  I told him I wouldn't call the police if he would just please leave, then he saw me holding my cell phone and a struggle followed.  He started trying to grab my phone from my hands and I resisted.  We struggled for some time with it until it dropped on the floor and i kicked it under the motorcycle.  My attempts to keep him from my phone failed tho, and he reached across and grabbed my phone.  I told him I couldn't breathe and he told me I was breathing just fine. He took my phone and took off.  It was the reason why he came in the first place.  He was dying to know, where I had been that night and who I was with.Luckily, my friends came back moments later and drove me to the emergency room.  I suffered 2 broken ribs and a collapsed lung from the incident, not to mention my Iphone that he stole.Now, my ex has a pending court case.  They are charging him with robbery and burglary and inflicting corporal punishment on a spouse causing great bodily injury. He is facing 5-10 years in prison."
