        "Summarize the following story in first person: My family and I flew to the Caribbean this past summer for vacation.  After landing and going through customs our rental car was ready.  We drove to the resort where they greeted us with fruit punch for the kids and rum punch for my husband and I.  The lobby was fantastic with open air views of the pool and ocean, marble floors and coastal decor with a touch of elegance.   Once we settled into our room we returned to the lobby to check out the activity desk.  Since we had never been on a boating trip we decided to take the off island boat trip to a small undeveloped tiny island where we would have food and drinks prepared by the boat captain.  We headed out early the next morning to meet with the boat captain and leave for our excursion.  The captain was a middle aged man with a pleasant demeanor.  The waters were a little choppy that day and the kids ended up getting sea sick.  I thought to myself please let this boat trip end soon.  The captain let us off at the small island while he stayed aboard to cook us lunch. My family and I went snorkeling and saw some beautiful sea life all around us.  The kids and I were amazed at how beautiful this little piece of paradise was.  We got out of the ocean and dried off.  There were a few sprinkles to start but nothing major.  We were getting hungry and could smell the food being prepared on the captains boat.  All of the sudden a huge gust of wind came barreling through, the skies darkened and the waves picked up.  It started pouring rain as the boat started sloshing back and forth through the waves.  The storm caused the anchor on the boat to become unhinged and the boat was adrift without an anchor.  The captain tried to get the boat close enough to shore but was fighting off every inch of water and waves.  After about four hours the sea calmed and my husband swam out to the boat and was able to bring the small dingy to get us from the island to the boat. We made it back to the resort unharmed.  My family found it to be exciting and exhilarating, something unexpected, full of wonder and a little nerves but an experience to always remember."
