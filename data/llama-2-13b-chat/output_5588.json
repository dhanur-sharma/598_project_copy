        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was wanting to find myself a boyfriend. I was feeling lonely and needing something to bring me some happiness. I went to a bar one night and saw a man staring at me. He approached me and told me his name and bought me a drink. We chatted for a bit after and then I gave him my phone number. He called soon after and asked if I wanted to go on a date with him and go for dinner. I accepted it and we scheduled to eat at a Chili's on a Saturday night. The food and atmosphere was amazing and spending time with him was a lot better than I expected. We hit it off that night and he asked me out. Of course I nodded yes without even thinking about waiting longer to see how this would plan out. We went on a few more dates in the next couple of weeks. However, he started to become super aggressive and forward with his advances and I was starting to feel super uncomfortable with his vibes so I told him straight that I did not like how he was acting. He apologized and asked me to give him another chance. Me being dumb I said yes. That did not stop and I broke up with him. I feel a lot better now that I got him out of my life because he was just plain creepy."
