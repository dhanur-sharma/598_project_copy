I t was the best experience I ever had.  We both have the best wedding I ever dream on .This experience was very emotional.  All this time prior to the event I was very nervous of how the things will end up going. The good thing is that all the time I went through this moment I had the best support not just from my friends but mostly from my parents. The whole occasion took about 5 hours. All the people show up on time to the event. The wedding had a descent size. It was not that big and no to small.  I have about 100 people invited . I have friends that came from other states. I have my close family with me. We have a live band.  The party ended up very late. I recalled an event that happened two months ago. I got married to my best friend and girlfriend to three years. I t was the best experience I ever had.  We both have the best wedding I ever dream on ."
