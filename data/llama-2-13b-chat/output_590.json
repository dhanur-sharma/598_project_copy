        "Summarize the following story in first person: June of this year my friends and I decided to road trip from Munich Germany to Croatia. My friends and I had tickets to ultra music fest and decided that a road trip would be the most fun way to go. The ride should have lasted about 9/10 hours give or take. We left the hotel in Germany at around 6 in the morning, we didnt want to drive to late at night because we would have been tired. We were on the road for about 5 hours when the car we were in experienced a flat tire. Luckily for my friends and I we all know how to change a tire so we got out the car and went to change the tire but there was no extra tire. We were stuck with no service in the middle of no where. We tried calling the rental car company and tried calling for help but there was no connection. My friends and I decided to walk back about 4 miles to where we saw a gas station to call for help. About an hour later we were at the gas station but there was no one there, and we still had no phone service. We decided to stay at the gas station for some time hoping that someone would show up. 4 hours later with no service and still waiting for help we decided to walk back to the car. 30 minutes after walking towards the car we saw a huge van start to head towards us, we jumped up and down for help and the van stopped and a musician who was playing at the same venue we were going to got out the van with his security. My friends and I explained the situation and they gave us a ride to the venue and backstage passes it was amazing. Before we got to the venue we were able to call the rental car company and they tracked the car to pick it up and return it to us. The celebrity and my friends and i ended up hanging out all weekend, and becoming great friends. My friends and I were shocked and it was considered the best weekend ever."
