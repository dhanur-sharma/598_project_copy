        "Summarize the following story in first person: One month ago I was in a local coffee shop I go to many days during the week. I was doing my usual routine of getting coffee. I went to the bathroom and left my laptop on the table where I was sitting. When I came back my laptop was gone. At first I thought I forgot where I was sitting. I got very nervous when I realized my laptop was gone. I asked the employee if they saw anyone take my laptop. They said they did notice anything. I was upset. I know I do not have the money to replace the laptop. I called mom when I got home to tell her what happened. She knows my financial situation. Later that same day mom made a visit to my apartment. She was carrying a box that looked like the box my old laptop came in. Mom had gone to the store and bought me a new laptop exactly like the one stolen earlier today. I was surprised she would buy me a new laptop. Her financial situation is not that good."
