        "Summarize the following story in first person: The other week I met up with some friends to go to the beach. While we were at the beach we noticed that some people were having some type of problem. It turned out to be an older couple. I helped them and administered CPR. The old guy was ok after that. The couple thanked me and asked me for my phone number. I gave it to them, and they told me that they would be in touch. Later in the week we saw the old people again, they thanked me and told me to stop by later at their house. When I arrived, they lived in a fabulous mansion. They said that they were worth millions and offered me a job. I\u2019m still deciding if I should take the job or not. It is a tough decision, and I\u2019m still struggling to make it. It is very tough for me to decide. I decided to talk to my parents about the opportunity, as it would be a life changing event. And in addition, it would require me to move to a new area and start over. This week, the people that I saved reached out to me and offered the job again."
