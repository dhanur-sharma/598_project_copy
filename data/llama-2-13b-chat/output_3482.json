        "Summarize the following story in first person: I've been visiting my father more frequently. I've been very optimistic due to my new job and my job performance. I remember that I had an issue with my coworker and I felt like I needed to ask my father for advice. He used to work in the hotel industry for 40 years. I know he has had many coworkers and he's never really had issues in the workplace. I felt like he would have good advice. I was working on a project with a coworker in the finance department. This person has been in the company for about 6 years and this is my first year. We need to sell our financial services to a client. My coworker wants to take the lead and wants to keep me in the background. I believe that he wants to take all the credit himself. I believe that he's doing this because I'm the new guy. He feels that since he's been with the company longer that he deserves all of the credit. My father told me to stand up to him and to be honest with upper management if it comes to it. I thought this was good advice. I told him that this behavior is not acceptable. He understood and was happy that I spoke to him about it and not went to upper management directly."
