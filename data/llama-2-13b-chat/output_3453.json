        "Summarize the following story in first person: I have been in and out of court with my child's father for four years.  It's been an emotional battle. Around four months ago, we went to court. I was sitting on the bench and I was hit with a huge surge of clarity. I realized that he will never help me take care of our child .I was extremely devastated after court because it sunk in. I cried for at least two hours. After I cried, I felt free...in a sense. When our child grows up  she'll know who really tool care of her. He's hurting himself and the relationship with his child. He will have to answer to her when she's old enough. In that moment, I felt light as a feather. I hadn't felt that way in years. I'm a strong believer in karma. I believe that the hurt my child's father tried to cause me,it will come back to him. That has given me peace. I have moved forward since then."
