        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last month I got one of the worst calls I have ever gotten. My dad had sent me a text message asking me to call him as soon as I could because it was important. My Maw Maw had been having a lot of health issues lately so I knew the call had to be about her. Even though she had been doing a lot better and in rehab I still got that feeling that it was about her. Sure enough my dad told me my Maw Maw had passed away early that morning. My heart pretty much broke in half when I heard those words. My Maw Maw was the best person I have ever met. She was loving to everyone and always put others before herself. She was married to my Paw Paw for over 50 years and he had passed 4 years prior to this so after he passed her health started going more down hill. She never smoked a day in her life or drank so I will always question why she was taken so soon and  young from me but I know she hadn't been the same since my Paw Paw passed, he was her rock and she loved him with all her heart. After I got the call I started searching for flights immediately. I had planned to fly out a week and a half later anyways but had to move up  my flight to get out there for the funeral. I ended up getting a flight for 2 days later and my mom was planning the funeral for that Friday, I flew out early Tuesday morning. It was nice to get home to family sooner than I had thought I would and see everyone but a very important person was missing.  My oldest son is 8 and he was pretty heart broken too knowing he wouldn't see her again. He was stronger than me though and able to look at her at the viewing and tell her goodbye. That stuff is hard for me, seeing a dead body and the person not being inside of it anymore. The viewing and funeral went very well though. It felt very rushed because her house was also set to close before she passed so we had to clean it out fast for the new owners to move in and throwing stuff away then trying to find a place for the rest was hard. I don't like just throwing her stuff away but we were pushed on time and really had no choice. My parents live in Georgia, me in Texas and Maw Maw lived in North Carolina so not really anywhere to put stuff other than my uncle's house which he has a lot in his garage now. I will always remember my Maw Maw as the best woman I ever knew and plan to make sure my kids always remember how great of a person she was. I am very thankful they grew up having such a great- great grandma. I think her death was also the hardest for me because she was my last living grandparent and probably the one I was closest too even though she lived far from me my whole life but always made sure she saw us as much as possible."
