        "Summarize the following story in first person: A week ago I went on a vacation to Russia with my dad. What a country! It is such an interesting place, with so much history. We split our time pretty evenly between the city and the country: about a week in the cities and a week and a half in the countryside. I enjoyed the cities a lot more, especially those museums! My very favorite was the Hermitage in St. Petersburg. An absolutely stunning collection of art! Though while I did like the cities a bit more, going to the country was pretty meaningful, especially for dad. He was so excited to show me the little village where he spent his childhood. I got to meet some (very!) extended family members, some of whom I had no idea even existed. It was really touching to see my dad so happy; I could really feel how much he missed this country, and how deep his roots run there. I have to admit, I was a little worried about safety before going, but everything was mostly okay! There was only one instance in which I was a little scared. One night in Moscow, around 12 AM, we were walking home from a bar and a man stepped out of the shadows. He demanded to see our papers (passport, visa, etc.) and was generally pretty menacing. However, once my dad began speaking Russian the man visibly relaxed. In an even stranger twist of fate, the man recognized my father's name! They didn't know each other, but apparently this man was from the same village, and their families likely knew each other well. Small world!"
