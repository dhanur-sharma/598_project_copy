        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was saving up money to go to a concert with my brother in law. I seen tickets for a band I had wanted to see and was a fan of for years. It was right there I knew that we were going to drive up and make it happen. Some of the music of this band highlighted my teenage years and I never had time to go to shows because of demands of work and monetary reasons. We set out to get floor seat tickets and I was actually intrigued by where the concert was taking place. The ride up to Nebraska wasn't that bad and we got to see a lot of corn fields and stuff I haven't seen in awhile. There was a lot to look forward to once we arrived at the hotel. There was some decent restaurants around and we took a chance on a pizza place which turned out to be great. Afterwards, we headed to the venue which was a good sized arena. I was happy that there was so many people that came together. I had been waiting awhile to get to see some of my favorite bands leave behind an awesome experience. After a couple beers, we went inside and prepared to go in. I had never been in the mosh pit before and was looking forward to it. The first band played which was Behemoth and they rocked it. My shoulder got hit, but I popped it back into place. Gojira then went on and made an impact with their aggressive, but powerful songs. I enjoyed a little bit of Volbeat which is another hard rock type of band that has catchy songs. Then the best of all, Slipknot was due to go on after a good break. The intensity of the intro they play off their second album was immense. I pretty much lost my voice and was sweating from jumping the whole time. It was more than I imagined and they delivered one of the most energetic sets I have ever seen at a show. They then played one of their new songs which I wasn't expecting and I was a bit emotional about it. It hit home that I got to see Slipknot for the first time ever and I'd never forget how much they gave back to us fans."
