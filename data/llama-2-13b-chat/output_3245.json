        "Summarize the following story in first person: A few months ago my boyfriend took me to a waterfall. It's in a wooded area near his house and he talked about it quite a bit but until then I'd never seen it. When we got there the first thing that struck me was the sheer natural beauty of the waterfalls before me. Several cascades in succession flowed down the mountain before me. I was captivated by the scene. I'm not sure if I had ever seen anything in nature as beautiful as that. This was a very important place to my boyfriend. He often came here to think and dream and contemplate. He says the falls help him to center himself when he is not feeling right. The fact that he brought me there to share that place that is so special to him speaks volumes of his feelings for me. I felt very honored to be there.  I felt like my boyfriend and I reached an important milestone in our relationship that day. It made me feel so happy and hopeful and loved. I almost felt like we got married there that day. Now I love the waterfall and go there every chance I can."
