I decided to go home alone. He had to get an Uber. I didn't talk to him for a few days. I decided to go to the movies alone. I saw a nice blockbuster. It had a lot of action scenes. It had a great plot. Later that week, I decided to be friends again. We both went bowling to celebrate. I barely beat him. It was an intense game but we both had a lot of fun that day. We got beer to drink while we bowled. I almost puked during bowling but glad I didn't. They would of kicked us out for puking."
