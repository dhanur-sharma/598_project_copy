        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was at my office about 3 months ago just catching up on my normal work tasks when my boss rang me up. Of course I set everything aside to take the call, try to make a good impression, all that. It was crazy though, we were just chatting about how diligent I was when out of the blue he offers me a supervisor position in the department. I didn't even know we had an open spot! I jumped at the offer, naturally, and he said he'd have his secretary bring the papers over shortly. I was trying not to act like a fool so I very humbly thanked him and told him I wouldn't let him down. Once the phone hit the receiver though I confess I danced a little jig. This was going to be a BIG promotion with a lot more pay/benefits, as well as responsibility. The papers to sign arrived and I quickly signed. After the secretary left I rang up my wife and told her to find her nicest dress, we were going out to celebrate tonight. When she asked what for, I sprung the good news on her and I had to move the phone away from my head as she squealed in delight. We'd been scrimping and saving for awhile now, and had been hoping to take a nice vacation. After telling her goodbye I leaned back in the chair and imagined what my new office would look like. I could almost smell the fine furniture and feel the aged oak desk beneath my fingers. Maybe I'd even have a nice little plaque with my name emblazoned on it? I chuckled a bit at how cliche it all seemed and got back to work. After all that, the last thing I needed was to mess up and get fired!"
