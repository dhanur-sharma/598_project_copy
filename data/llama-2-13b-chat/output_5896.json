        "Summarize the following story in first person: The car accident was very weird, even my doctor told me hearing it made her scared to drive. As I was driving I glanced into the rear view mirror and noticed a truck coming up on my too fast. I tapped my brake lights to try and bring the driver out of his fog. Before I knew it he had rear-ended me. I looked in the mirror as I was getting ready to pull over and saw that he meant to hit me again which he did. Now I was getting freaked out it starting to feel like a Stephen King movie. I looked in the rear view once more and realized that he intended to hit me again. I swerved into the next lane checked to see what he was doing. He had followed me into the lane. I then swerved back over and quickly pulled into a parking lot. I saw him fly across the oncoming traffic lanes and plunge into a cemetery across the road. He tried to get his truck going again, I felt like he was trying to flee the scene. However, his truck had become lodged on a tombstone.  I proceeded to call 911 where they promptly sent a sheriff. After the sheriff interview the other person he came over and talked to me."
