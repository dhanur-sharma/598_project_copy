While there, I interacted with several people including treatment specialists and other patients.  I realized that I was not diagnosed.  I did not react to the medication they prescribed. I also realized my depression was a manifestation of my own psyche.  I subsequently left after about a week, determined to solve my problem on my own.  I have subsequently renewed my relationships with my family members and friends.  This is an attempt to create a support network.

This to begin the process of clearing my mind of unhelpful thoughts and anxieties.  I am open to new relationships, but realize that I'm not in the right place now to begin a new relationship.  My work continues to be drudgery, but it is simple and I'm well compensated.
