        "Summarize the following story in first person: I recently had surgery for my knee injury. Surgery went well, but the doctor found the injury was worse than expected. I had to have addition repairs done to my knee. It also turns out the recovery is way longer than expected. I was told by the doctor I would be walking again a few days after the procedure. However, that wasn't true. It turns out that this will be a 3-6 months recovery process. Right now now I am going on about 2 months. I still can't fully bend my knee back past 90 degrees. And I still experience a lot of pain. The pain usually hurts the most at night and keeps me up sometimes. I am required to wear a knee brace all the time. But the brace is pretty uncomfortable and itchy so I take a break every chance I get. All in all right now this wasn't looking like the best idea. But I guess that's just the process of going through recovery. I am in physical therapy two time a week, and it does help. So hopefully after therapy is completed I will be better off."
