        "Summarize the following story in first person: Time does not necessarily heal all wounds! My son fell into a waterway covered in algae about 3 months ago, and I'm still feeling intense bouts of anxiety regarding the event. I have frequent nightmares and I almost have panic attacks whenever we are out in public, especially near any body of water. The nightmares are silly, and always center around what would or could have happened, if there hadn't been people around to help get him out. Luckily between me and the good sanitarians, we were able to get him to safety very quickly, so the nightmares have no basis in fact. We had been going for a stroll on the waterway that day. It was the first day it hadn't been raining in over a week, so we were feeling some cabin fever. I suggested an afternoon walk, and my son was only too happy to come along. He brought his toy truck with him, and had been playing with it near the waters edge. I saw a neighbor and went over to talk to her, when I saw out of the corner of my eye my son's truck rolling into the water. Too late, I saw my son fall in after it. Between me, my neighbor, and a few passerby, we were able to get him out quickly, but it was a stressful experience for both of us.  Luckily, he calmed down and seemed to forget the incident within the hour. Me on the other hand, I'm still reliving it everyday. It's amazing that it happened to my son, and he's fine, while I'm still in shock about it! It's quite surprising how that happens, isn't it?"
