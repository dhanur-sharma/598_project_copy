        "Summarize the following story in first person: After my shift at work, I decided to go out for a drink close to home. It was late so my options were limited. I remembered there was a hotel bar that was open late, so I decided to check it out. I sat at the bar and ordered a draft beer and a shot of tequila. An attractive woman, who was sitting a few seats over, started a conversation with me. Turns out she had very similar interests as me and we had many things in common. We flirted quiet a bit, until it was time to leave because the bar was closing. She invited me up to her room to have a few more cocktails, which I gladly accepted. We had an amazing night, staying up until morning to watch the sunrise. That morning she asked me to stay over again, and I did. I ended up staying the entire week. After the week had passed, she had to leave and go back home. She had asked me if I would like to move away with her, and I seriously considered it. We are still talking to this day, although she lives on the other side of the country. I am still considering moving out to her."
