        "Summarize the following story in first person: At this said party the guest I spoke about was someone I was just astounded to see. That was my real blood father. Take into account he lives about four states away and time that has passed between visits was around six years. Now just because we live far apart doesn't mean we don't have a good relationship, we do it's just that while I was little he had to move away so he could make money to live. I didn't understand this at the time but as I am a adult now I understand this more than ever. What helped me understand this more was the fact that I now have kids myself and I get that you always do what is best to provide for them. So with the background that we have I was so happy and elated to finally see him again after all these years. Now don't get me wrong on another front I also have an amazing step father that helped my mother raise me when I was a young boy and I love just as much, so I am truly blessed on two fronts.  As the party passed and the day went on with lots of fun and happiness, I started to grow sad because I felt he would have to leave that night. He told me he was staying the weekend and actually planned a fishing trip with my step father also. I was so excited for this as I knew I would have the two most important men in my life for the whole weekend and fishing on top of that. I think to myself this is going to be the best weekend in almost six years for me personally.  So after this party we head out and pick up supplies for the trip and also picked up bait and such as well. So after arriving we set up camp and then cooked out and just sat and talked among us. To be honest the best part was that he included my step dad and they also bonded as well. I honestly don't think I could have asked for a better weekend that that, and to share it with two people that care about me was the icing on the cake. I was glad for that surprise and it is by far one of the better moments in my life."
