        "Summarize the following story in first person: when you do the work to overcome your difficult experiences, you can heal. \u201cAnd, when we choose to do it together, our families really can become even better in the end,\u201d said Hibbert, also author of the forthcoming memoryMaybe you\u2019re going through a similar experience or are grieving another kind of loss: a romantic relationship, a friendship, a job, a house. Or maybe there\u2019s a completely different kind of stressor in your lifeStill, you might worry that your emotions will be too overwhelming. While this can happen, people tend to get stuck because they\u2019re actually not feeling their emotions, Hibbert said. \u201cInstead, they think about, wallow in, and replay events. But they are not letting themselves really feel the pain, loss, sadness, anger, that is lurking withinWhen people bottle up challenging situations, the problems grow and mutate into horrible worries and anxieties,\u201d said Ryan Howes, Ph. D, a clinical psychologist and author of the blog \u201cIn Therapy.\u201d Talking about your troubles, however, helps you better understand your own fears and get valuable feedback from others, \u201cwho have probably experienced similar levels of distress and can give you the perspective you need. While you might not have time for your usual healthy habits, you can still take good care of yourself. For instance, if you can\u2019t prepare a nutritious meal, keep protein bars in your bag, she said. If you can\u2019t go to the gym for an hour, take a 10- to 15-minute walk around the block to \u201crelieve physical tension and clear the cobwebs in your mind.\u201dTen minutes of meditating or a 20-minute power nap also helps, she said. Remember that a stressful situation isn\u2019t a sprint; sometimes \u201cit may be more of a marathon. [You] need to pace [yourself] and take the necessary time to rest to reboot your mind and body.\u201d\u201cDuring a moment of meditation or prayer, visualize handing those items over to your higher power and letting them go. Then focus on what you can control, like your self-care, your words, your actions and your decisionsYou might assume that you can and should handle this difficult time on your own. Many people do. But, interestingly, when Duffy talks to his clients, most say they\u2019d never expect others to manage similar situations alone. \u201cWe need to relinquish control, ask for help, and receive it with grace.\u201dWhen asking for help, you may need to be direct. Let others know what you need, such as \u201csupport and compassion,\u201d and what you don\u2019t need, such as \u201c[not] criticiz[ing] my slowness to heal,\u201d"
