        "Summarize the following story in first person: My dad always wanted to go see Metallica. He loved the band ever since he first discovered them in the 1980's. However, due to me being born, family responsibilities and our financial situation, he was never able to buy tickets to go see them when they were on tour in America. He always worked and saved and gave everything to me an my mom. We never wanted for anything because of him and his sacrifices. But we always knew his longing to go see his favorite band. He wore an old beat up Metallica T-shirt everyday at home and played their music almost every Saturday on his day off or in the car. So, when I turned 18, me and my mom decided to plan a trip for him to go see Metallica during their US tour this year during his birthday weekend. We saved up so that he could go to a hotel and truly enjoy the weekend during the festival. During that time, mom got sick and we put our plans on hold. She passed away not too long after, just 2 months before the day of the trip. Me and my dad were devastated. Mom was our joy and losing her made us very depressed. One day, after looking through her things, I found the concert tickets that we had bought to go see Metallica with dad on his birthday. I showed dad the tickets and he broke down crying in bittersweet tears. We both went to the concert and loved it, and enjoyed it in my mom's memory. She was there with us singing along."
