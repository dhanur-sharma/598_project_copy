Today was one of those days where either I get up, or I get up. I then decided to go outside, but because it was raining, I got wet. I went back inside, felt tired enough to go back to bed, but I still had to change out of my wet clothes. Then I got a phone call from you know who. I got so excited that I didn\u2019t care that I was naked, tired, and there was a puddle on the floor. We are going on a date this Friday. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to sleep. What am I going to wear? :naked dance: :singing in the rain: oh diary, one day I\u2019ll look back on this and say remember when I didn\u2019t pay attention to anything but the phone ringing. life is good I tell you. It should be lived to the fullest always. Something that Ii can be proud to say for sure. Cant wait for the next time."
