        "Summarize the following story in first person: At the end of August a new Blair Witch game was released on video game consoles. I have been a Blair Witch fan for 20 years, so this was a big deal to me. I decided that I would write an article about the series which would chronicle the mythology of the story and pitch the article to the major horror sites. To my surprise and delight, one of the first sites I pitched to, Wicked Horror, picked it up. It ran in four parts over the course of about a month. I was so excited! I had just gotten paid to write a four part article on a subject I loved and was passionate about! In addition, it was very well received. Garnering many views and many likes on the pages. I felt elated and proud and the rush that comes with creating something and having it be appreciated. The actual writing of the article had been exhausting (even more so because I was (and am) in the middle of a rather intensive diet which had a tendency to make me light headed at times) and required an immense amount of reading on my part. This was all made worthwhile by selling the piece and getting the positive reaction, however. In the end the experience left me mentally drained for a long time afterwards (writing around 100 pages while also working 48 hour weeks and dieting was pretty intense). Still, I wouldn't have traded it for anything, because now, in my own small way I know I have contributed to a story that I love and respect. And that makes me feel very proud and all of the sacrifice and effort seem worth it."
