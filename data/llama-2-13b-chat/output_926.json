We saw the Mayan performance at Xcaret, and that was the highlight of our trip. We really enjoyed the performance. We saw a lot of cool stuff. We met a lot of cool people too. There was a day we visited some old structures off the beaten path. we were shown really old architecture. It was cool, and I took a lot of pictures. We ate a lot of local food, and I loved it. We drank the local brew and loved it. A lot of locals liked us. They showed us around. They also welcomed us. We will definitely return."
