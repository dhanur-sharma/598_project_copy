        "Summarize the following story in first person: Dear Diary,It has been almost 4 months since I've started my new job. I couldn't be any happier. Since graduating from college last year, job searching had been extremely difficult for me. I am painfully introverted with social anxiety, so finding a job that I was both comfortable with  and suited my degree had been a daunting task. Before landing my current job, I had two other jobs in the past year. I ended up quitting both of them in less than a month, unfortunately. My previous position was a warehouse associate. I quit in January. The period of unemployment between then and July was extremely stressful for me. I had student loans that I'd been putting off, and I felt incredibly guilty living that I was home doing nothing, while my parents were working. I'm sure that had I send in hundred of applications through Indeed, Linkedin, and Glassdoor, but I just wasn't getting any responses. I finally received a callback in July, and luckily, I got the job! I love it here, my hours are great, and even though I have coworkers, most of the time I am working on my own! I'm hoping to buy a car by the end of this year, and move into my own apartment by the fall of next year. I guess, the moral of the story here is to never give up hope, no matter what!"
