        "Summarize the following story in first person: I have been her friend since high school. Not only did we happen to attend the same church, we also share the same birth month. I didn't know until it was our last year in high school. We share so much in common. Different career path and our family background made us attend different college although it was against our wish. We had planned to attend the same college and even study the same course. Fast forward to four years in college, it was her graduation party. I attended the party with one of our other friends as she was someone we loved so much and very proud of. Her relatives from Germany were also in attendance. I knew it was set to be a glamorous graduation party. I thought she was just going to give a vote of thanks when she picked up the mic. It was more than what I thought as she started talking about her ordeal in college and how she scaled through. She started by thanking God and her parents, the school, faculty and friends. As she mentioned friends, I was happy she has finally recognized us as part of his college journey. I didn't expect it when she mentioned how I have been a source of inspiration to her and about how I have been hardwired with the will to go on. I was moved to tears while she talked about me. It was an overwhelming and inspirational experience for me and it made me realize who I am and what I am made of."
