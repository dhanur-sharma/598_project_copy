        "Summarize the following story in first person: Today I loaded a 22-foot Penske truck with all my worldly possessions. I began driving my truck fromPortland, Oregon to Phoenix, Arizona. My first day of driving was going to get me to a place south of Sacramento, California. It was set to be around ten hours in the truck. My father in law was in the cab with me and my elderly chihuahua was in my lap. As we worked our way south to Crater Lake we saw beautiful views and incredible scenery, but the trip was taking much longer than expected. The truck couldn\u2019t go faster than 30 MPH over hills and was guzzling much more gas than expected. After ten hours we were still about four hours from our destination and I was beyond tired. When we hit the California border I felt moderately better, but knew we still had a long way to go. It was pitch black outside by the time we got to Sacramento. My dog started caterwauling. I knew she likely had to relieve herself but I wanted to find a gas station to stop. Soon she stopped howling and I felt a warmth in my pants. She had peed in my lap on the only pants I hadn\u2019t packed. We finally got to our hotel just before midnight, got some horrible, cold and stale McDonald\u2019s and attempted to rest before resuming our journey the next morning."
