        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 6 months ago I was tasked with finding a way back to school for spring semester. Coming off of fall break, I was struggling to find money for a train ticket. Luckily the dilemma was short lived. Because of my supporting family and friends they came up with a way to help me. With the support of family and close friends, they helped out tremendously. I was able to get back to school to finish out my spring semester with great grades. The lessons learned is saving money and looking into fares ahead of time as they are cheaper. People will pay a premium for train tickets if they purchase them late. Another lesson learned is to always have a strong support system. In addition to having a strong support system, it reminds me to never forget those whom helped me. Paying it forward is an important part of my journey in life. Keeping in mind a philosophy of interdependence, we all owe one another. I do my very best to dedicate my time and efforts to helping others. One day those same people you have helped will be in a position to help you. In saying that, always do good unto other people as you will one day need it."
