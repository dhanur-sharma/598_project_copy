        "Summarize the following story in first person: We started feeling distance and disconnected 3 weeks prior to our relationship. We fought alot and bickered at each other for no reason. It was stressful. We decided to take a break for a week and it ended up being a full break up. We both moved on and this was 6 months ago. Now we have been talking again and realized it ended pretty poorly, we always got along. Shes a nice girl. We have decided to hang out for the day as friends only because we enjoy each other's company this weekend. We really helped each other out in our time of need when we were dating and its unfortunate how it ended so ugly. We are going to try to end it better but not plan the future and just go with the full little by little, day by day. I am excited to see her again. Like i said we have both been really busy with work and school which lead to us breaking apart in the first place. I think we both need to take a step back and slow down. Afterall we connect really well as human beings and yes are still attracted to each other but both dont have the time for each other sexually. I hope Things go well. Im hoping beyond hangout."
