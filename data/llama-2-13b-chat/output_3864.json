        "Summarize the following story in first person: In the family of 4, I'm the head of the family, the bread winner. I being a traditional man, don't allow my wife to work. So we are all dependent on my income. My kids are of the ages 12 and 10,  a boy and a girl. One is in high school while the other is in primary. I'm a hardworking man and husband, I can't remember ever calling in sick at my place of work. I hardly have a cold or come down with a fever. But lately,  I've been feeling as though my body weren't my own. My wife has asked me to visit a doctor, but I just decided to get drugs from the pharmacy nearby. Despite taking these drugs, I keep feeling weak, I who have never called in sick has called in twice now for being bedridden. So today I finally decide to go see my regular doctor. But I see a P.A. instead of my regular doctor who refers me to a cancer specialist. I am diagnosed with cancer, have only 3-5 years left if I go through miserable treatment. We have to tell my children about it and my wife also informs me that she is pregnant again."
