        "Summarize the following story in first person: I gave birth to my first daughter in May. I have two toddler boys, so I was terrified to have a third so close in age. While I usually love being pregnant, this one was a little harder on me both physically and mentally. I was constantly exhausted due to running around with a 3 year old and one year old every day. When I found out I was pregnant we had planned on waiting a few years before deciding if we wanted a third child, but we were very surprised when I got a positive pregnancy test.  It was a very trying pregnancy for me, and I spent most of my time panicking that I couldn't handle three kids. Everything changed when E was born. All of the things I had worried about wound up being much easier than expected. While things are a little more time consuming and difficult with three kids, I could not imagine life without her. Watching my sons interact with her, and seeing the love they have for her is such a blessing. Even though unplanned, I love having all my kids so close in age because then they will be able to play together as they grow older. My second child was a difficult baby, which was one of the reasons I was so scared to have another. So far, E has been the easiest baby. She sleeps decently,  and is content on her own most of the time. I am constantly amazed at how perfect her and my boys are, and am so thankful for how our family turned out. I really feel as though our family is complete now."
