        "Summarize the following story in first person: As Charles Dickens said, \"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.\" I decided I wanted to adopt a companion dog. I found Buddy , a sweet a cute Border terrier in the animal shelter.    I fell in love with him even before we got home.   My life changed, just like I hoped it would.  I was never lonely, I was more active when I walked him.  He liked children when the kids and got along with other dogs. Best of all he loved to snuggle in the chair with me.  I was happy and content. One early evening, we went out for a walk and we encountered a dog that Buddy knew.  Buddy immediately went after him, growling, canines showing, very vicious.  It really surprised me.  About halfway through the walk, Buddy did the did the same thing with another dog.    I just couldn't understand it..The worst was yet to come.  We got home to the apartment and a group of kids was petting a dog.  I veered to go around them, but Buddy broke through to get to the dog.  In the process, he bit one of the children.  My heart broke right then and there.  He had to be returned to the shelter.  It has been two months, and I still tear up thinking about Buddy.  I miss him terribly.  Why did he change so much?  Buddy was the best of times and the worst of times.  And I am still grieving."
