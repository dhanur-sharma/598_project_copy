        "Summarize the following story in first person: The strangest thing happened to me a police officer randomly knocked on my door and said he had a complaint of a strange smell like that of drugs being made.  He asked if he could look in the house and of course I had nothing to hide so I let him.  He checked assured me that everything was okay and then left. The next day it got even stranger.  I had another random knock on the door and when I answered it was Child Protective Services.  The caseworker claimed that they got a call that my children were living in unacceptable conditions and she was doing a follow up.  It was trash day and I had the trash waiting to be taken out to the curb but that was the only thing wrong with my house. She took pictures of the trash and took a tour of the house.  She looked at everything even the bathroom to make sure that I had running water (who doesn't).  After she was done looking around she talked to my girls and took pictures of them.  It felt like such a violation.  She gave me a paper saying I was being investigated for child neglect and left. After she was out of the door the first thing I did was call my wife and she came home from work immediately.  We went insane on cleaning the house and I mean over the top.  We were scrubbing floors and making sure there wasn't a speck of dirt anywhere.  It was just unbelievable that this was happening to us. For the next several weeks the case worker would show up at random.  This made it to where we didn't even let the girls have their toys out to play.  It felt like we were the worst parents in the world and if even a small mess got made it was a complete disaster.  This was three weeks of hell. Finally without notice the case worker completely dropped the case without even filing it.  We had to call Child Protective services to even find this out.  Overall I don't think I have been more scared or worried about anything in my entire life.  You hear horror stories about how this happens to other good parents but you never believe it until it happens to you."
