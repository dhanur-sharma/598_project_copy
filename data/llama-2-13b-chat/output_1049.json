        "Summarize the following story in first person: What a day , August 8, 2019, It was my 45 birthday and I thought it was going to be just like any other birthday I have had. But this day my family and friends decided to throw me a surprise party. I was in total shock, never expected s surprise party. It started off like a typical day waking and getting ready for work. I had plans to have dinner with my significant other that night. After work came home and got ready for dinner. When we got to the restaurant he provided them his name and they said that they had a special table for us in the back. The back room was usually only used for special occasions. When we walked in through the hallway to the back room it was full of my friends and family. We had a nice dinner and there was a DJ playing music, so we enjoyed a little dancing. I have such wonderful family and friends and getting to enjoy my 45 birthday with them was fantastic. I can't imagine having a nicer birthday. We enjoyed good food , good music and wonderful company. After hours of enjoying ourselves it was time to leave. I hated that the night had to end."
