        "Summarize the following story in first person: About four months ago, I started working at a factory. It was a small relaxed factory and my sister worked with me. There were a few workers that had been their for a while and I knew that they had some sort of issue with me and my sister. It felt a little like being the new kid in school and everyone immediately had an issue. I started training for the job in which I had to coil wires. The lady training me told me to take my time and I will get faster in the next few days. It was an easy job and I felt I was doing quite well. After being there for one day, I went in on my second day and the boss came and got me right away. He told me that, \"based on your sister and your production, I have decided to let you go.\" I thanked him for the opportunity and left immediately. I was very angry and disappointed. I wasn't given a chance to improve my speed and I honestly thought I was doing well.  I felt embarrassed and thought I was being let go because the older workers had an issue with me before they even got to know me. I tried not to let it bother me because it didn't seem like a well ran factory anyways, but it definitely still created some sort of effect on my self esteem. It made me feel as if I wasn't good enough or they thought so little of me that I didn't even deserve to have a chance. Although I had these mixed emotions about being let go, I still just tried to laugh it off. Besides, I wouldn't have gotten very far working for a place like that."
