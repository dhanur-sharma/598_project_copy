        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 2 months ago I went on a camping trip with some friends I hadn't seen in a really long time. It was an impromptu trip really. I received a text message from a crush that I never let go of. She suggested we get together. We started talking about people that we had lost touch with. Messages were sent out, and before we knew it, we had a trip planned. I couldn't have been more excited really. My life was so mundane at the time, I really needed something to happen.  And the thought of getting to spend time with my forever crush was intoxicating. When the weekend of the trip arrived my excitement was on a level I had never really experienced before. We met up at the camp site and when I saw everyone there, I nearly felt like crying. We sat around for a while just catching up. Laughing. Getting back into the swing of things. Honestly, it was like we had never been apart. It began to rain at first, which was a bummer, but all piled inside a tent and played some board games. When the rain let up, the real fun started. We were drinking, and dancing, and we went swimming. At one point I was dancing with my crush on a table I fell off. She fell on top of me. We kissed. I couldn't believe it. After all these years, it finally happened. That trip, as of this entry, was the greatest weekend of my life. It's going to be hard to top that one."
