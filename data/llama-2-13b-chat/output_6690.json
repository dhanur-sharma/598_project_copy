        "Summarize the following story in first person: This story is about how a relationship can falter and how you can notice your own flaws, and that we should all be trying to change for the better as people. Not everyone changes, or wants to, or can. However, my story was about realizing that in my relationship when I wanted to think none of it was my fault I realized that some of it is, and that you really have to be committed to view the other person's perspective. It doesn't mean you have to agree, but you should always be learning. The most surprising thing was when I learned that my SO felt a certain way that I would have never thought of, and suddenly a lot became clear. I always thought of myself as pretty emotionally intelligent, but when I learned I was wrong it really opened some doors to more thinking. The only thing this really means to me is again, it's important to keep learning and keep having and open mind and keep trying to better yourself. It doesn't mean things will work out. It doesn't mean everything will be OK. But it will probably be better for the person trying to grow, even if you end up broken-hearted in the end. There's not much you can do about that. In conclusion, that relationship didn't end out with us together forever. Now I can take what I learned and bring it into another relationship. I can only hope to keep in mind everything I learned. That way, if things ever fall apart I can be proud and say I did my best."
