        "Summarize the following story in first person: This past weekend, my family and I traveled to the Great Smokey Mountains National Park in our new Jeep.  We visited the \"Smokey Mountain Jeep Invasion.\"  My goodness, it was so much fun!  It was a four day event, beginning Thursday.  There was a get together meeting that night.  Friday was a day at the convention hall, to visit vendors and take instructional classes.  There was an after party Friday night.  Saturday was much the same as Friday.  Then, Sunday morning, we went on a group ride through Cades Cove, a beautiful section of the National Park.  There were over six hundred Jeeps on the ride through the park. There were over seven thousand in attendance to some of the events over the weekend.  Everywhere you looked, there were Jeeps.  My daughter was delighted, she thought it was amazing.  We stayed in a nice hotel in the town of Pigeon Forge that had a two pools, with splash fountains, slides, and a lazy river.  We ate at some great restaurants.  We visited a small zoo, where my three year old got to see some animals she had never seen before.  It was a great weekend, all made possible because we finally got a Jeep."
