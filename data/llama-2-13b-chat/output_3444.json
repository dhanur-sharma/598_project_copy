        "Summarize the following story in first person: My oldest sister recently got married, and I of course attended her wedding. The wedding was 5 months ago, but I still remember it fondly. My sister is a bit unconventional, I guess you could say, so the wedding was no different. It wasn't set in a church or in a field next to a barn like a lot of weddings these days. Instead, it was held in an underground cave. It began with guests being blind folded and led down stairs deep into the cave. They were seated at there assigned table and then when the blindfold was removed they could see the beautiful surroundings. My whole family ended up attending, which was a huge surprise. Everyone was so happy and joyous to see that the whole family was there, including those some people haven't seen for years. The evening began with my sister and her groom making a grand entrance and performing a short ceremony. Afterwards, the drinks started flowing and the real fun began. There was a light show with lasers, smoke machines, and a fantastic DJ. Everyone was having such a good time, and the surroundings pushed everyone to let loose. Fun and laughter was had by all, especially since the drinks just kept on coming. I'm sure some people thought they would never make it out of the cave alive. I'm sure to this day we still have a few family members trapped inside. All in all it was probably the best wedding I have ever been to. It was unique and different, and the best part was everyone was able to attend. I only hope that my wedding can even come close to the fun everyone had that evening. Leave it to my unique sister to through a wedding for the ages."
