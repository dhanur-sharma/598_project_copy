A lot of other things came out. I found out that she thinks that I attack her verbally, and I found out that she is resentful towards my dog. It was a good conversation in the end, because I found out how she felt. She also found out how I felt. I was disappointed in myself because I decided before that I would not get into a dispute like that, and since I did, I was not happy. I hope it never happens again. We are good friends. I know that we both want peace. We both have strong opinions. She is a great person. I want to grow. I want to have a good friendship. I want us both to be happy."
