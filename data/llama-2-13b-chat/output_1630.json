        "Summarize the following story in first person: On July the 4th, I was at home in the morning doing nothing and feeling kind of sad. I unexpectedly got a call from one of my friends and she invited me out with her and her boyfriend. I was kind of surprised and pleased at the same time. We ended up going to the movies to see Spider-Man and it was such a funny movie. After that, we got dinner at a local Mexican restaurant nearby. I ordered tacos and my friends order nachos to share. We left the restaurant after finishing our meals and saw a food truck selling ice cream across the street. We decided to get ice cream cones for dessert. We walked about for a bit while we ate our ice cream and chatted about different things. About an hour later, we found the perfect spot on the grass near a bridge with an open view of the sky. My friend made a comment that it would be the perfect spot to stay and watch the fireworks. I agreed and we sat down and waited for the show to start. After the fireworks show was over, we all went home. I felt so happy that my friend wanted to share that holiday with me and it made my entire day so much better. I was very happy."
