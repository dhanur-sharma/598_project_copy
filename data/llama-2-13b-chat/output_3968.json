        "Summarize the following story in first person: so i have a story that happened about 1 month ago that deals with me going to visit my father. Throughout the years we haven't had the best relationship at all. So during this time of being together we were able to get things back on track. to have a good father and daughther relationship. We spent a lot of time hanging out just to try and get comfortable with each other. That seemed to work out pretty well. being that eventuallly we started cracking jokes on each other. the most memorable part was when I told a joke that was true of something that he did in the past. No one seemed to be offended and that was great. We spent a lot of time out shopping and riding around in his car. I was able to get anything I wanted from the store we went to. We went out to dinner and ate seafood together. Overall it was a wonderful trip where we go to talk about the past. Times he wasn't always there for me and how he plans to not continue the same path. I really enjoyed hanging out and getting to know my father."
