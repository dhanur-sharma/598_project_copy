        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last week I was on my way to work when someone hit my car from behind. Fortunately, it wasn't a hard hit because because we were only driving about 15-20 miles per hour. There was a woman with 2 small children in the car that hit my car.  We both pulled over to the side and eventually moved into a parking lot. The woman who hit my car did not speak English and I was having a hard time understanding her. I speak spanish but it's a bit rusty. I had my daughter help translate because she speaks spanish fluently. The woman gave my daughter her ID and some paperwork from the car. I wanted my daughter to let the woman know that since there wasn't really any damage to my car, I wouldn't call the police or file a claim. When my daughter was talking to the woman their conversation became animated. I was picking up on the conversation in bits and pieces but couldn't really understand why they were so excited. They continued speaking for a while and my daughter pulled out her phone and started searching for something on her phone. She showed the woman an image of my daughter with another young girl from about 15 years ago. Then the excitement really grew. The woman wrote down a phone number and gave it to my daughter. Finally, my daughter and the woman hugged and my daughter and I went back to my car. It turns out that the woman that hit my car is the mother of one of my daughter's school friends from a long time ago and the two young children in the can were my daughter's classmates children. The woman had given my daughter her daughter's phone number so they could reconnect. It's a small world."
