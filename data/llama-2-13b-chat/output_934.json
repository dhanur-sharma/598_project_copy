        "Summarize the following story in first person: Five months ago, my life turned upside down when my mother passed away from a terminal cancer. Losing her was completely shocking and unexpected. She was young, full of life and had a heart of gold that touched everyone who ever came to know her.  She was my best and confidant and the best grandmother to my young daughter, I could not imagine living the rest of my life without her unconditional love and support. I never liked May, especially because my birthday was in May and the day was always bitter-sweet for me. Although my mother always made it special, I felt sad because I never had any childhood friends to share it with. Now May took on an entirely different meaning, May was the month when my mother left this world forever, I would be left orphaned. I wanted to fill the last days of her life with as much love and peace as possible to repay her back for all the love and  sacrifices that she did for me while I was growing up. I brought my mother home for hospice so I could be with her to the end. I prayed to God as I watched her terrible sufferings, it seemed like she could go at any moment, however, she was trying hard to stay alive until my birthday. It was the most important day of her life and she wanted to be there for me. She lived to see the day, even though she could hardly master any strength, she even signed my birthday card with three simple and yet most powerful words: \" I love you!\". I cried as I help her in my arms. She feel asleep shortly after giving me my card and watching me blow the candles on the cake that my husband brought into her room. She soon slipped into a coma and took her final breath the next morning while I held her hand. I cannot describe the pain of that parting, however, God's strength and my family were the only things that carried me through. At her funeral, my three-year-old daughter came up to me suddenly and said : \"Don't be said Mommy, you have my love forever\". These words made my heart melt and I then understood ever so clearly that life can be summarized in three simple words : \"I love you\", just as my mother said to me before her passing. Those words can never die or be erased."
