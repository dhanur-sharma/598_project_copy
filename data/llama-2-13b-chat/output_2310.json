        "Summarize the following story in first person: My memorable event that happened to me was having the opportunity to travel half way across the world to New Zealand and Australia. Recently I had been watching more tv shows and movies from New Zealand and Australia as well as Youtube videos. I had been gradually exposing myself to the pacific culture for years. I found out that a friend that I met while doing study abroad was now living in Auckland, New Zealand. I had been telling this friend for 2 years that I had to meet up with her! And I was so proud of myself when I finally made it happen. I stayed with her for 2 weeks and it was a well needed vacation. One of the best experience of my life. I visited tons of museums, witness a Maori cultural performance and even climbed an extinct volcano. I hadn't seen my friend in almost 6 years and it was wonderful catching up again. I got to go party with her and her friends, go to the bar with her co-workers, and sit down at some of the best restaurants. I also experienced my first time in a casino and got to take the public transportation like a local. It was bittersweet when I left, but I was still joyful because Australia was next. With Australia I got lucky. My plane ticket from New Zealand to back home in America allowed me a 22-hour layover in Sydney, Australia. Sydney and Auckland were like night and day. Although Auckland was more fashion forward, Sydney was more business savvy. Everything looked expansive, refined, and luxurious in Sydney. I took one of the hop-on, hop-off busses and was fortunate to see all the highlights within a span of a couple of hours. Leaving Sydney going back home to America left me with a lot of great memories."
