        "Summarize the following story in first person: In May of this year I graduated from the University of Montana with a degree in information technology. I was able to do quite well in school and graduated with a good GPA. This was especially memorable to me because I'm not a traditional student. And I'm in my 30s and never thought I would have a degree. I tried college earlier in life and didn't do so well and figured I wouldn't go back but I'm really glad I did. It feels good knowing that I accomplished this goal and I'm proud that I did it. It certainly wasn't easy and there were a lot of missteps but now that it's over I can look back and know that I saw it through. It was also memorable because I haven't really accomplished much in my life and didn't think I could do this or do well in school, so it's been a big morale boost for myself and my confidence. I was supported by my girlfriend through most of the process and am thankful she helped so much. I certainly learned a lot of new things and am eager to apply them to my life. It was also a unique experience in the classroom and I met a lot of new people. I remember the excitement when I received my degree in the mail. I opened it in front of my girlfriend and she told me how proud of me she was. It was so nice to be able to share that memory with her. I certainly would have done some things different, but I don't regret any of it looking back."
