        "Summarize the following story in first person: I've heard of strange things happening to other people-- cars lifted from trapped toddlers, alien abductions with gratuitous probing, etc., but lamentably, nothing of the sort had ever happened to me. Until, that is, four weeks ago, when a most peculiar accident set into motion a series of events that has forever altered my life. I was turning left onto Broadway from Franklin Ave, when this total dill-weed on an electric scooter appeared outta nowhere and ran into my side-view mirror. I rolled down the window and hollered, \"Watch where you're going, you total dill-weed! The street is for cars!\" but she didn't seem to hear me. However, as I was angrily watching her e-scoot away, I rear-ended the car in front of me. The woman who was driving flung open her door and approached my car. I cut an intimidating figure, however, and when I exited my vehicle she quickly choked on her words at the sight of my 5' 4\", 255 pound shadow bearing down on her. \"Lady,\" I said, \"Where'd you learn how to drive? Dukes of Hazzard reruns?\" That's when I realized she didn't understand a word I was saying. My daughter, who happened to be with me at the time, recognized her peculiar language, so I instructed her to give this woman a serious dressing down. \"No, dad,\" she said, \"this accident was clearly your fault. And besides, I think I recognize that bumper sticker.\" The woman had a very large Smurfs bumper sticker, which was now crumpled from the impact of the accident. My daughter asked her some questions and determined the woman to be the mother of her childhood friend, Tabby. They hadn't seen each other in some twenty odd years. The woman was on her way to visit Tabby in a mental institute, and my daughter asked if she could tag along. I objected at first, because I don't want my daughter hanging around crazy drivers with Smurfs bumper stickers, but my daughter winked at me and whispered, \"I'll make sure the insurance company doesn't get involved, here. I promise, dad.\" What a strange coincidence. And what a great daughter."
