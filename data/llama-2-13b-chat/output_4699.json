Maggie will follow you every where even when you do not notice her following you. She lived with us for a very long time and we are so used to her being around us. Maggie maintained a peaceful coexistence with our other animals.  She spent 18 years with us which is year younger than than our first daughter.

Maggie had become a significant member of the family that we have so grown up being fund of her forgetting that shes getting old too and she was going to leave us someday. Suddenly she became ill and she started shedding away her fur, We too her to the nearby Veterinary hospital hoping they could save her at all cost because we dont want to let go of her.
