        "Summarize the following story in first person: Three months ago, I was get a vacation trip to Canada. This is a business trip for the new project. I was the only person for attend this business meeting for my company.  As experienced when traveling by train from Toronto. A little adventure as observed.   The train was seven hours late in eastern Manitoba;  Suddently we stopped in the middle of the dark forest. One of the drivers came to the last car, the bar car, where we were. He said, \"we missed a flag stop, there is a trapper and his dog out there. We cannot leave him in this cold (-33 C).\" If you want to know about cold read Jack London, \"To build a fire\" book. We could see a very faint light about 2km behind the train. Then  we backed up until we came to where we saw the trapper, his baggage and his dog. A couple of attendants jumped off the train tended to his baggage. The train, 13 cars and about 500m long, continued to back up. The trapper's big black dog was taken into the heated luggage car, the first car after two locomotives, wrapped in blankets and placed near and electric heater. Our resident chef was arousen and went to the kitchen at a very late hour to prepare a warming meal for the cold man. A bit of \"Canada\" for you, He had been there, outside by the track, for over five hours. No Cellphone service and he had no idea when the train  would arrive. When it came, it drove by him at 120km/h. Imagine his horror."
