        "Summarize the following story in first person: I lost my cats a few months ago. I felt so terrible for losing them. How did I even managed to lose my cats? I have no idea, but I felt so bad for losing them. I'm such a horrible person for losing them. Have I not done enough to prevent that? Apparently not. I put up fliers everywhere when I lost them, just to see where they would end up at, and at first no one replied to all. I thought all was lost when someone finally replied to me. They told me that they found my cat. I was so happy and I asked them when I could see them again, but to my surprise they asked me if they could keep them. Well, I thought about it. At first I didn't want to say yes, but then I remember that I lost them in the first place. And I thought that maybe these new people should have a chance in keeping them. After all they found my cats, and kept them well fed and everything. So in the end, I said yes."
