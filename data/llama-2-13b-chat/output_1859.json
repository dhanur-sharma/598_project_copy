        "Summarize the following story in first person: There I was, being awaken by my lovely boyfriend on my birthday. We live together so I have no clue how he was able to pull it all off without me even noticing. The day started off with him playing our song softly in the background with a soft kiss on my forehead. He had made me breakfast. I am still in shock that I didn't hear his alarm go off I'm always able to hear it. What he had made for breakfast was my favorite breakfast meal. French toast with whipped cream some strawberries and bananas with orange juice to drink with it. Since I finished my meal I went into the kitchen I noticed he had huge balloons spelling out my name. On the bottom of the strings that were attached to the balloons some cards were floating. I opened them up and they were all filled with love letters he had been writing for an entire year. Just when I thought my day couldn't get any better, he comes in and tells me to get ready because he had plans for the both of us and my family. We took off to the mall where he gave me some money and told me to use it on whatever it was that I desired. I bought myself some makeup and thigh high boots that day. After a good while of shopping we started to feel a little hungry. And of course since it was my day, he told me to choose where to eat. Even though it was my choice I chose his favorite restaurant, because come on, the guy deserved it. The rest of the day we decided to spend it with my family, where I come to find out that my parents and my boyfriend planned to take me to an escape room. When all was done and we had finished the escape room my parents decided to order take out for the whole family and headed back home where we enjoyed our delicious thai food.  After a while, my boyfriend and dad come in with a small box in each of their hands and my mom in the back holding a cake. I first take a look at my cake and it's a cake with Ariana Grande's face on it. I am a big fan, but anyway I start crying. I finally decide to open the boxes my dad and boyfriend have and I see TWO VIP TICKETS for an Ariana concert. At this moment I am losing my shit and grateful as fuck. No birthday can be topped but it's okay the memory of this one wil last forever."
