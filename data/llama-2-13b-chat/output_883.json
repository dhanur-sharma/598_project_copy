There was a cool breeze and lots of sun.  Just what I needed after a hectic couple of months. I'd been working non-stop.  It seemed like I had been working for weeks on end.  Really quite a grind over the holiday season.  I have been trying to make some extra money to by the kids some presents.  They have been so good this year, I had been taking on as many extra hours as I could at work.  Then it came.  A text from work.  I thought it was about taking on another shift, but no.  They actually texted me that I was fired.  Fired on my day off.  I was stunned.  I worked so hard for them and this is how they treat me.  Thinking back over the year, it's been rough. This is my second job this year and I put all I had into it.  I had lost my previous job earlier this year.  I wanted to make a success of this one but I failed yet again."
