        "Summarize the following story in first person: This event was very significant in my life. My son will now be 14 this year. It\u2019s so difficult when your child becomes a teenager. It\u2019s like a whole other person is emerging from them. I think the most successful thing to do while going through these changes is to remember that your goal is to have them depart from you successfully. It is very hard to see your children grow up but they are going to inevitably. Parents should strive to make sure their children are able to be independent functioning adults and contribute to society. Although, as a mother I can say I do not care how old my son gets he will always be my baby and my firstborn. He is a pretty cool team and has made it easy for me. I do not like him getting older but there\u2019s nothing I can do about it except pray for his life and the best things for it.\ufffc\ufffc if I had to give any advice to other mothers it would be listen to your children. I am thrilled that my 13-year-old still wants to talk to me every day about his day. I pray when he turns 14 he wants to do the same. I pray he does it forever honestly. I would like to continue a healthy driving relationship with my adult children. It\u2019s nice to be able to journal these emotion and express how it feels to watch your children grow up.\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc It certainly helps to vent and get those feelings out."
