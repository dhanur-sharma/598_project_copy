        "Summarize the following story in first person: I witnessed something that is utterly heartbreaking. My grandmother was dying from brain cancer. She had a tumor in the back of her brain that was growing and causing slurred speech, vision issues, and balance. I was at work one day and got a phone call from her not making any sense. I panicked and sent my daughter over. She found grandma laying in a fetal position with her head cracked open. My daughter promptly called 911.  My grandmother was rushed to the E.R. She had lost her balance and hit her head on the table and caused her to have a concussion. My heart sunk to the floor.  The emotions that flooded me are hard to describe. I did not want to see my grandmother in that state. They doctors decided to do an M.R.I. and found out that the tumor spread down her central nervous system (CNS). After this concussion, this had kept her in the hospital for a few days, she was advised to have all around healthcare. I decided to be all around health care for my grandmother. I bathed her, fed her, helped her use the bathroom. I was basically watching her dying. Her cancer spread more, and she would have grand mal seizures at night. She was scared when it happened. I had to hold her and use calming techniques to assure her I was there. I asked myself why did I sign up for this? Because, I cared and loved my grandmother very much. The doctors believe her heavy smoking attributed getting cancer. However, I was surprised It didn't end up in her lungs, vs her CNS."

I was devastated, but I was determined to take care of her and make her last days comfortable. I was her only family and she had no one else to depend on. I was determined to make sure she was comfortable and happy. The doctors had advised me to give her morphine to help her sleep better and help with pain management. I had to give her the medication because she couldn't take pills. I had to mix it with applesauce and give it to her through a syringe. She was scared at first but then she got used to it. I would sit with her and hold her hand, talking to her and telling her everything will be okay. I was her only family, and I was determined to make sure she was comfortable and happy. I had to give up my life to take care of her. I was tired all the time, but I knew I had to do it. I had to be strong for her. I had to be her rock. I had to be her everything. I was heartbroken, but I was determined to make her"
