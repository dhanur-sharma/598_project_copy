        "Summarize the following story in first person: On a weekend getaway to Galveston, on of the things we did was go to Pleasure Pier.  There were several things that stood out during that trip but Pleasure Pier was the most memorable. I remember the guy that was going around taking pictures because I talked to him multiple times.  Mainly telling him i did want to take pictures. But the highlight of the trip was the pod of dolphin.  While we were in line, there was a pod of dolphin that caught everyone's attention.  There was more attention to the dolphin than to the rides on the pier.  They were playing with a ball that was floating in the water.  I can remember looking around an noticing how  many people were watching and reacting to the dolphin.  There were many thing we did on the trip. WE walked on the beach and collected a few shells. We rode bikes on the seawall. We ate at several restaurants. The most memorable event was what happened with the dolphin because it was unexpected.  I could remember feelings like a little kid inside.  I can remember the looks of the people around me and their reaction to the dolphin.  That was a trip that I enjoyed and I'm glad that we took it."
