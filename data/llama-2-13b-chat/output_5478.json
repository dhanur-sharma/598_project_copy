        "Summarize the following story in first person: Dear diary,I know it has been a while since I last wrote, but A LOT has been going on in my life. In my last entry, I told you I was planning a surprise birthday party for Alana, my girlfriend. Well, let me tell you, she was definitely surprised. I planned her party at the orphanage, where she spent a majority of the last year volunteering and reading to the children. These kids, oh my gosh, the bond Alana has with them is amazing! I knew the Alana, along with the kids would love celebrating her birthday there. So, the morning of Alana's birthday, I sent her to the salon for a morning spa date with her best friend. I needed her distracted if I was going to be able to pull this off. After Alana's friend Bri confirmed that Alana was preoccupied, I headed to the orphanage with the best decorations and party favors my dollar store budget could afford to decorate the tiny little room that the 10 children shared. They joyously prepped the room, eager for Miss Alana to see their work. Little did any of them know, I had my own surprise up my sleeve. Not only were we going to surprise Alana for her birthday, I was finally going to get down on one knee and ask that beautiful woman to be my wife. A few hours had passed, and Bri finally texted me that they were en route. I could feel my nerves building. In just a matter of minutes, Alana would walk through that door, and my life would chage forever. We turned the lights off and waited for Alana and Bri to appear in the door way. The moment that I had been waiting for was finally here. The girls were greeted with a roaring \"SURPIRSE!\" as soon as the door opened. I was standing there, sweating more than I think I ever have! I'm not sure exactly what I said to her, I know I fumbled and stuttered through an \"I love you more than anything else,\" and I might have even shed a tear. All I know is that when that moment came, I got down on one knee and finally asked the question that I have wanted to ask since I laid eyes on her, \"Will you marry me, Alana Moser?\" Tears filled her eyes and she jumped eagerly into my open embrace, and tearfully accepted my proposal. It was the perfect place, time and occasion to take the leap with her! She is finally my fiance, and I couldn't be happier!"
