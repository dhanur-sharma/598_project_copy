        "Summarize the following story in first person: A few months ago, we took a vacation back to my home with my son.  It was scary because it was my son's 1st time flying and I was pretty stressed out about it.  It was the 1st time I had been back home in years, and the 1st time for most of my family to meet my son, who was one and a half at the time.   The flights went better than expected and we eventually landed, rented a car, got through customs and drove to visit family.  We spent a lot of time with my mother, who had recently moved into an apartment and was living on her own for the 1st time in her life.  My father passed away 3 years ago and previously she had been living with my younger sister.  But she decided everyone needed their own space and moved out.   We got to see all my cousins and aunts and uncles, and my son got to meet his cousins for the 1st time.  My husband also got to meet many of my family members he had never met before too.  We had time to see my best friend in the world, who I do not get to see enough.  We visited my old childhood home to see how it looked, drove past my high school and grade school and toured around all the places that had meaning to me growing up.  My mother was so happy to spend time with her grandson.  Of course she spoiled him with toys and presents.  To be able to share this with my son and my husband was pretty amazing.  We live so far from where I am from it was really great to be back with them."
