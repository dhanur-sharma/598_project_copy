        "Summarize the following story in first person: June, 2019. I don't recall the exact date as it is now in the last waning days of August but I definitely know it happened in June. There is a licensing expo in my town every year and last year I met the owner of a company I get collectible pieces from. This year, it was a little bit different. A few other people were coming in for a visit along with the owner of the company I mentioned before. I have been swamped with work lately because we are short-staffed in the office and I suppose it is much easier to put more strain on one person than it is to hire someone or extend the overtime hours that the one person is getting. By that, I mean myself. But I digress. Anyways, one of the people who was coming in, I was engaged in a chat with. I had perceived that I had done something to upset the organizer of this event a few months prior so I did not particularly wish to reach out and speak with him because I did not want relations strained more. The person I was chatting with sent me an invitation via instant messenger which went something like: \"Your presence is required Thursday at 8:00 pm.\" I had to give him directions to my place as I don't have the money for a car and he didn't care because he had a car rented for the duration of his stay. I actually delayed proceedings a bit because I was trying to get pictures done. A few people like what I can draw, although I don't think I'm all that particularly good, and since I didn't have an exorbitant amount of money like the person organizing the event, I wanted to do what little I could to contribute to the occasion. We ate at a restaurant where I could never go on my own. The most inexpensive item was something like $60! And although it felt a little awkward, being the only girl there and not really being as involved in the company or the company's online group like the others, it was a nice experience."
