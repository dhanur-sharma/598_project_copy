        "Summarize the following story in first person: The other day, I was watching a live feed of my favorite consultant. This was around 2 weeks ago. This consultant was showing off some fancy new jewelry that was stunning. I think this jewelry even costs thousands of dollars. The consultant revealed halfway through that there would be a giveaway. Whoever shared the live feed on their page would be entered in. The winner would be announced the following day. Of course, I shared the video. I went to bed that night excited for some reason, thinking I may have a chance to win. Low and behold, I was right. When I woke up the next morning I received an email saying i was the winner! I do not think I have ever been so thrilled before. It was an amazing moment. I thanked the consultant profusely. I am so thankful that I won this giveaway."
