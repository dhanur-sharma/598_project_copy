        "Summarize the following story in first person: From the time we first met, James has never been a healthy eater. Most of his meals have come from a plastic package or a drive-thru, with a giant soda to wash it down. I tried not to judge him for it, but over the years I noticed he had started to gain more and more weight. He just didn't seem to care. I mean, I love to indulge at times, but it got to the point where, if we got pizza, he would have three or four slices for every slice I had, to the point where we had to get him his own extra large pizza every time. Well maybe I was too gentle, but I was never able to talk sense into him. Until one day he was feeling so dizzy at work that he fell over and had to leave early. It turns out, he went to the doctor and had to get some tests ordered, and he has diabetes. Type 2 diabetes. His doctor told him that the only thing he can do about it is change his diet completely. He has to avoid carbs now; if he doesn't, he will have some serious health problems. Now maybe this is a weird way of looking at it, but I see it as a wake-up call for both of us. I wasn't able to help him before, and now he's sick. But it's not too late for us to do something together. We've been learning to cook healthy meals together, which has been a lot of fun for both of us. It's something we never knew we might like to do together. And now I've stopped eating unhealthy foods myself, to show him that we're in this together. I know diabetes is a terrible thing, but it has inspired both of us to come together and make healthy changes in our lives, to make us better as individuals and as a couple."
