I look forward to knowing how to do my job and to become efficient at what i do. I look forward to learning new things and applying these new things. I am glad that i have gotten to know my coworkers as this was a big worrying point for me. I tend to be very reserved and quiet when i do not know a new work place. I have been able to overcome that. I have worked here for 8 months and i am surprised how much i get along with everyone at work. This has made me love my job. It has also become easier to be comfortable at what i do. I am surprised. My own family has said they see a change in me since i've started working here. At my old job i was constantly stressed. I was overworked. I never had time for my family or friends. There were many things i missed out on. Over time i got tired of my situation. I am glad i did. I feel better as a person and a worker. I look forward to many things now. I have even started working out again. I go for runs a few times a week. I visit my parents through out the week. I hang out with friends when i can. I have also found that i have created many close relationships with my coworkers."
