She didnt even remember me her own grandson. It was a said that it was a severe stroke. We all knew she didnt have much time left but I was the only one that was there. I was there from the start to finish. Let me tell you more about the specifics. I was there when she lost control of her urine. I was there when she lost control of her bowels. When no one was there for her. I was. I just wanted to make sure she was ok. But deep down inside I knew she wasn't ok. I knew that one day I'm gonna see her die a painful death. I was coming to give her the lunch I had just made, when I noticed a thump on the floor. I ran with all my might tonget to her as fast as I possibly can. She had no pulse her eyes stared at me and that's it. It was at that moment I knew she was gone forever."
