        "Summarize the following story in first person: Approximately four months ago I was contacted by my manager to speak about my current role with the company.  At this point in time I was coming up on being employed with the company for nearly twenty years.  My performance over the years had always met or even exceeded expectations.  However, recently the company gained a new CEO, and he wanted to speak about the program that I managed.  He wanted to schedule an appointment with my manager and myself to discuss the program. After a week or two had passed the meeting that was scheduled with the CEO was abruptly cancelled.  This concerned me, but not overly so.  A few days later my manager advised that she wanted to meet with me.  She let me know at that time that my role was being eliminated, and that I would be losing my job.  I was extremely upset.  I felt betrayed and abandoned by the company that I had worked for for nearly twenty years.  I was making good money and didn't know what I would do to support my family.  I felt depressed, defeated, and like a failure.  My wife and family were supportive and encouraged me through the tough times.  I needed to refocus and decide what new career path I wanted to embark upon."
