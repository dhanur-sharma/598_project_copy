        "Summarize the following story in first person: Over Memorial Day weekend I took a vacation with my two grown sons and my boyfriend. We had planned for months and I had my fingers crossed as to how it would go. It is difficult to coordinate 4 people meeting from 3 cities. My boyfriend drove to Newark to visit his daughter and her family. On Saturday morning, I flew into Newark where Doug picked me up outside. The timing was perfect. We drove to NYC to drop off items for my younger son's apartment. My older son had taken the train up to NYC on Thursday and stayed with his brother. He was able to visit school friends. We all fit in the small car and continued on to Cape Cod. The condo rental was nice and near the beach so that evening we hit the grocer and planned for the next day. We got up early to take the first ferry to Martha's Vineyard. The air was cool and the view wonderful. As soon as we hit land, we rented bikes and headed for an hour long ride to Edgartown and the lighthouse. We witnessed a wedding in front of the lighthouse and proceeded to an outdoor meal of seafood at a really nice restaurant. We toured a bit by bike and shopped. We then biked back and walked out bikes through the historic cottages of Martha's Vineyard. We finished out ride and got the bikes back before closing and took one of the last ferries back to the Cape. We then went to the Knob that we read about in travel guide for sunset. It just undeveloped piece of land which people go to catch a gorgeous sunset. It was really the icing on a wonderful day. We all enjoyed the day so much and we enjoyed each other. I don't often get a chance to connect with my sons as they live on the East Coast. I am from Kansas City. Sharing adventures is a great way to really appreciate the time that we have."
