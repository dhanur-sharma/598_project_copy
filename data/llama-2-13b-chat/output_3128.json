        "Summarize the following story in first person: Several months ago on a Monday morning I had a scary incident at work in which I seemed to have issues speaking and using my hands. At the time it was very worrisome so I ended up asking my boss for the rest of the day off. I then picked up a couple things from my car and ordered a Lyft to take me to the hospital. When I arrived there they had me take a seat and explain what was going on. I remember having issues being able to explain myself. They then checked me and wheeled me over to the triage station. There the doctor did several tests involving balance and strength. After concluding all the tests he said that he didn't want to scare, but it was possible I had conditions of stroke. After that they took me to a room with a wheelchair and several people rushed in. They began monitoring my signs and the first thing they noticed was that my blood pressure was really high. After they put a sleeve on my arm, hooked up an IV and gave me a blood infusion. That helped to really settle me down. Once I was stable they then asked a bunch of questions to see what the issue was. Later they took me down to the radiology lab for several tests. That took several hours, but in the end they said that all the tests came back as negative so it was good news. Finally, later that night at around 9:00 I was finally released and got a ride to pickup my car at work. Overall it was a stressful day, but could have been worse. In the end my thought was it was possible it was just a panic attack because a couple of stressful things had happened that morning."
