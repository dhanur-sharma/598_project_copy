        "Summarize the following story in first person: I have my own business creating different products for clients on demand. I make anything from clothes to accessories, pillows, pillow cases, decorative items, throws, among others things. I show my items on my website and the clients order the amount they need, I make the products and ship them to the clients. Two months ago I got a big order for custom made pillows of different shapes and designs. I started sewing the items with and was halfway done when my sewing machine stopped working. This put my business in serious jeopardy. The client doesn't pay until the products are delivered. I didn't have enough money to replace or repair the sewing machine. I need one urgently to complete the order. I didn't know what to do. the order was due a week from then. I was so worried and panicked. I told my husband about this. he saw how depressed I was and how concerned I was. The sewing machine was industrial quality. It wasn't something I could but cheaply. It was an absolute necessity if I was going to survive as a business. My reputation was at stake here. I also didn't want to let this new client down. There was potential for continued business with them and I couldn't risk losing their trust. I came home one day after shopping for groceries feeling helpless. I noticed my husband has a funny smile on his face and he told me to look in my office. I went in there and to my surprise I found a large box on the floor. I opened it and saw the sewing machine I desperately needed. I was able to complete the order on time, deliver the product, get paid and, on top of everything else, the client recommended my business to a partner who also order products from me."
