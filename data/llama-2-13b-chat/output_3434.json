        "Summarize the following story in first person: A few months ago,  during the summer I went on a trip to the lake with my husband and in-laws . We rented a lake cabin that had beach access right in front of it. My dad brought kayaks from his place, he lives nearby, so we could use them while we stay at the cabin. My mother in-law and father in-law are not the outdoorsy type but somehow I convinced both to go kayaking. My father in-law went first and in the morning. He was a natural and didn\u2019t have any issues. My mother in-law was a different story. She is a heavyset lady and an alcoholic. Later that evening I talked her into going kayaking, in her own boat, I didn\u2019t want to share one with her. She agreed and we got ready. The life jacket didn\u2019t really fit her but it was the largest one we had. We took off from the shore and she surprisingly kayaked well for a little t. We didn\u2019t get far before she wanted to head back to shore. Upon reaching shore I got out of my boat and pulled it on to the beach. The rest of the family was already on the shore watching us. She tried to get out of the boat but she was stuck. I should mention that her brother and his wife were also there. Everyone was laughing and her brother tried to help her out of the boat but she just yelled at him. My husband tried to help her too but she yelled at him. They grabbed their phones and started recording her thinking she would fall in the water trying to get out of the kayak. It was funny and I joined in with laughter. Finally her brother tried pulling her out and she stood up. I thought he was going to push her in the water but he didn\u2019t and he helped her to shore. I was shocked she didn\u2019t fall in the water but I laughed really hard and it still makes me smile."
