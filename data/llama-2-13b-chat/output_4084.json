        "Summarize the following story in first person: My event is that I got in a huge fight with the owner of the building I work in . He was angry at someone I was hanging out with, and decided that this person could no longer come over to my house. Which is a bit presumptuous if you ask me. He and the other guy yelled at each other a bit and then the owner turned to yell at me! He said I was an idiot if I hung out with that guy. I was really mad. I was so mad that the next day I refused to accept his apology, which is unlike me. I normally am a very forgiving person. But I had had enough. I vented to my friends about it the next day. The owner of the building even threatened to throw us out and break the contract we had to rent the place from him! How ridiculous, I thought. I didn't know if I wanted to stay there anymore. I do not like when people yell at me, especially men who are bigger than me. I am a petite woman. Anyway, it took about 3 days of me refusing to talk to him at all, but eventually we were able to work it out. We decided to stay in the building even though he had been a huge jerk, and we are still friends to this day. Although I will not rent anything from him again, haha. But all's well that ends well."
