        "Summarize the following story in first person: I met my current boyfriend in June after having a bad breakup a few months before that. I hadn't been looking for a new relationship after what I had been through in the previous one, but this new one felt right somehow. My last boyfriend had lied, he had cheated, he had manipulated me, and had went as far as to tell me thst I didn't deserve him and I wasn't pretty enough. The last straw had been when he attempted to choke me, leaving bruises on my neck. For months, no one believed what happened, and a lot of former friends took his side, leaving me feeling alone and helpless. Depressed and a shadow of my former self, I stopped doing things I enjoyed and didn't get out as much. Then I met my new boyfriend and he taught me that not all people were like my ex. He helped me see that the world isn't as bad as I thought and not everyone was like that. He listened to what I had to say, taking into account what had happened and for once, someone actually believed me. He took time to listen, helping to navigate through my feelings and emotions and held my habd throughout it all. Without him there, i would still be depressed and lost. He saved me, helping me feel safe and protected amidst everything I was feeling. He not once made me feel any less of a person, or made me feel like I had been at fault. Because of him, I made it through after a rough few months of suffering. I don't know what I would have done without him being there. He gsve me the strength I needed. I still have to face memories of everything thar happened with my ex, but now, I'm not afraid. I know I have someone on my side to help me through the darkness and lead me to the light."
