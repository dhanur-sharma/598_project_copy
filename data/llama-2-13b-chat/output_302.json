        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was able to take a trip to Budapest with one of my best friends who I had not seen for a year or more. It was such a lovely trip. We took a boat ride a sunset over the beautiful water and were able to see the parliament building lit up at night. We ate absolutely amazing food. I had initially been worried they had a very meat-centric diet, and as a vegetarian I thought I wouldn't get to enjoy authentic dishes but I had some delicious goulash and many other unique plates at restaurants. I bought a jacket that I absolutely love one day when were walking down the street of our airbnb. We stumbled upon a hole in the wall thrift shop, it had such beautiful pieces. I easily could have bought many things but settled for a cute vibrant blue cropped blazer. I have worn it many times since and always get complements. My friend and I still talk about the trip to this day, we had such an amazing time together. Our feet were about to fall off from all the walking we did, but it truly gave us the best experience in seeing the most we could in our short time. One of the most surprising and beautiful moments of the trip was definitely when we went to the fisherman's lookout. I had not known what to expect because one moment we were on level ground and the next we came out of a tunnel that offered us the most stunning view of Budapest and the river. We had a cocktail at the top and just soaked in the beauty of the moment. That had to be one of my favorite moments of the trip."
