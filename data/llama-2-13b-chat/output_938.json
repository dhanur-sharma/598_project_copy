        "Summarize the following story in first person: As a result, I don't have a way to work other than public transportation which doesn't run bidirectionally and is often late. The bus system is decent but not nearly what I need to work the hours I do. There are nights I'm out of work so late and my only option in getting home is to call a taxi or an Uber which can be costly. I have contacted my ex-husband several times to find out why he missed the payment but have been unsuccessful in reaching him, I feel I may have to contact the court via my lawyer to handle things and this will be costly as well. This situation has caused me great stress. We had an agreement and I don't understand why my ex would want to make things that much more difficult for me. Haven't we argued long enough? Haven't painful words been enough? I am concerned that if this continues, he will forfeit on other court-ordered payments and It would be me in an even worse bind if that's possible. For now, I have been lucky enough to get a ride home from work but this won't last forever. I really hope this can be worked out without having to go to court. I hope he can understand the situation he has put me in and will do right by me. I hope he will fix this so I can have my car back.  Life already has enough stressers to have to go through this again. Perhaps it can be worked out. I really hope so."
