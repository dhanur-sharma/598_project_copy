        "Summarize the following story in first person: I have never felt so much comfort and discomfort at the same time. A week ago today is the day that John left for Italy, I am happy that he has gone to better himself through his education, but am sad because I can't be there to help him anymore. I know he will learn a lot, probably more than he ever has because this will be as independent as ever. I hope that he is eating well, but not giving in to all of that tempting food, after all it is Italy! I long for the day he will return. I do wonder if he will come back, maybe he find love or a job out there and never returns home. But, this is a part of growing up and I will support his decisions to want to be independent and progress his life. I don't know who will visit who first, if I will go over there or he will come back home. I want to give him an opportunity to settle in and make friends first. I also want to give me an opportunity to learn a little Italian haha. I need to at least know how to ask where they keep the wine haha. I am so proud of him, and can't wait to see him again. I hope that he finds some really good places to take us out to eat, my mouth is watering just thinking about all of that food. I also need a little time to save some money! I haven't been on a trip in forever!"
