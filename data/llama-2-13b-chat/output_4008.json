        "Summarize the following story in first person: After my best friend passed away a few months ago, I felt a hole my heart. The person that had always been there for me to talk to and confide in was gone. This person was incredibly important to me and I'd never be able to talk to them again. Still grieving after a week, I received news that my brother's baby was going to be born. I rushed to the hospital to see how him and his wife we're doing and to see my newly born nephew. When I arrived, I could see my brother behind a glass screen, holding a small human in his hands. Witnessing this, positive feelings started to welt up inside my chest. This new life was a part of my family and I wanted to protect it. I felt a happiness I had not felt in a long time. A few days later, I was finally able to hold my nephew in my own arms. While holding him, it made me reflect on how fragile life is and how you need to appreciate every moment you spend with the people you care about. I vowed there that I was going to be a good uncle. I vowed that I would always be there for my nephew and family. There will always be a hole in my heart from my friend passing, but this new life had eased the pain. The cycle of life can be soul crushing and unforgiving, but it can also deliver happiness at unexpected moments."
