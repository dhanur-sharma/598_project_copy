        "Summarize the following story in first person: I had a friend who died at age 38 of a heart attack. I went to his funeral and had a really hard time processing it. It seemed so cruel and unfair. I couldn't even be in the room with his body because it made me so upset. I spent almost the whole time in the lobby of the funeral home. I didn't join the room with his body until the actual service began and the eulogy was read. After the eulogy, people walked up to make small speeches about what he meant to them. The first few people who went up seemed really self-centered. They were not people who were close to him. It seemed more like they were looking to grab attention and were just modeling grief to make people feel sorry for them, on the day that should have been honoring the life of an amazing, positive, funny, kind human being who had been taken too soon. So even though I hate speaking in front of people, I got up to make a speech. I talked about how I had never seen him angry, never seen him even upset, never seen him be anything other than friendly and welcoming to people and life in general. He always had a smile on his face despite a life of health problems. I wanted to pay tribute to someone who deserved a long life but touched the lives of others instead. I think I did my best and I still miss him and think about him."
