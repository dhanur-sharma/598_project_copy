        "Summarize the following story in first person: My nephew and I are pretty close. I love doing things with him when I have the time. He loves kites. I have probably bought him 5 kites over the past few months and he spends hours playing with them. He called me one day 2 weeks ago to tell me his parents bought him the biggest kite he ever had and he wanted to come to my house to fly it in the yard. I said of course he could come over, so I made plans with his parents and they were on their way. While they were on the way, I ordered a few pizzas and went to the corner store to get some candy and soda. 30 minutes later, I saw them in the driveway. He jumped out of the car with a kite twice the size of him and told me to go to the back yard. We both ran to the back and started getting ready. The wind was perfect for flying kites. I offered to help him get it right and ready, but he assured me he could do it. He actually did it himself. 20 minutes later, he was running up and down the lawn, laughing and staring up at the sky. We ate pizza while we watched him have fun. It was a great time."
