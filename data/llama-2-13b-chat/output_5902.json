        "Summarize the following story in first person: It all happened one week ago, I and Jackson where in a good relationship that could lead to us getting married before then but all of a sudden, things began to go haywire as Jackson changed in character all of a sudden as soon as I told him that I was pregnant with our baby. Jackson then kept his distance from me and started displaying certain attitude towards me. He started keeping late nights as well and would always scold me when I confront him about it. All I felt at this time was that the whole word was covering up on me because my parents earlier told me that they never where comfortable with my relationship with Jackson. With this, I was devastated. Jackson then came to me one afternoon and said he was calling it off and that was all he wanted. I pleaded that we mend the Issues we had but all that was to no avail as Jackson said he was going to take responsibility of the baby and of course would grant me some benefits.       With this, I ended up wallowing in sorrow and poured all my frustration on alcohol .I spent almost all my days indoors drinking myself out forgetting the fact that I was pregnant and the alcohol could affect the baby. Jackson came by last week with a check in his hand and handed it over to me saying it was my benefit. The check read $50,000 and he said I should use that for my upkeep for the time.     That same day, I went to the bank with the check and on getting there, discovered that he scammed me. The check was fake and at that instant felt a  sharp pain in my tummy and suddenly everywhere went dark. I opened my eyes only to see myself on a hospital bed and few minutes later, discovered that I had a miscarriage just as the nurse was about to say. In all, It was so sad as I was scammed and had a miscarriage all in the same 24 hours. In all, this was a sad and still a sad memory to me."
