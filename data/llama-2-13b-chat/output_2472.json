I didn't see anyone nearby, so I waited a moment, and then picked it up. It was full of money. I looked around for a while, trying to see if anyone would come back in a panic looking for it. No one did. I then went home and looked online to various neighborhood groups and apps to see if anyone had mentioned losing any envelopes or money. No one di. I even posted to a few different places, hoping to find the owner, while being vague enough to avoid anyone who didn't rightfully own it. I got nowhere. No one came forward to claim it. The closest I got was one person who said he lost $5 there a month ago, but that clearly wasn't the right person. I still have the envelope. I don't know what to do next."
