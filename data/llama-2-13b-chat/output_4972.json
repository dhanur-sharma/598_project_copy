        "Summarize the following story in first person: In May, one of my close friends from high school graduated from medical school. I originally wanted to attend the ceremony but I had to go out of town for my brother's graduation. Fortunately, my friend was having a party as well. When I got to the party I saw some classmates that I hadn't seen for many years. It was an interesting reminder of how I didn't like one of those girls. I didn't realize how fancy or big the party was going to be. Everyone was dressed up and my friend's relatives from Africa were all arriving. Clearly, it was a really big deal. As the night progressed, we ate and danced and talked. I was really happy I could be there for my friend. Finally after a few hours, people began making speeches. This included my friend's father, a Cameroonian uncle/preacher, and my friend herself. During her speech, she highlighted her relative's recent accomplishments including getting into pharmacy school and their own graduations. Then she started talking about me! I thought it was going to be family only but then I heard my name. I was not expecting to have the spotlight on me, no matter how briefly, in front of nearly a hundred people. I'm sure the moment got caught by the videographer. I was very happy to hear that my friend would include me in her special moment. It was a nice reminder of how much our friendship has meant over the years."
