        "Summarize the following story in first person: I asked for one thing on my wedding day - to be allowed to sleep in. That's it. My groomsmen and I stayed in the wedding suite( darn thing had 5 bedrooms) and we went out to catch up on old time after the rehearsal dinner. at 8am someone started banging on the door to the suite. I was the only one able to answer it ( i stopped early to avoid ruining the day) and it was my soon to be father in law. With 13 children. \" since you have the biggest room, we'd thought we would set them up in here with the Nintendo and everything\" then he tried to leave them with me. Not gonna happen. I made him get others to watch the kids while i went back to sleep. But it was done, uninterrupted sleep trumps interrupted sleeps significantly. Especially if you had a few scotch's as toasts the night before. My one brother-in-law is an actual chef, my other brother-in-law thinks he is one. The one who is a chef seasoned the meat and went outside to get a drink. Wannabe chef brother-in-law comes along, sees the meat on the counter and salts the meat rendering our main coarse inedible. Didn't serve the cake. We did the whole cutting the cake tradition, but nobody actually served it. Shame too, it was good cake....all things considered that's actually not that bad. Still, cake!"
