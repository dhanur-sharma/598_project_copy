        "Summarize the following story in first person: After wanting kids for a long time, I finally got pregnant. My sister-in-law told us she was pregnant too! always knew she wanted kids, and even set a goal age for becoming a mother. Before she started trying, she was the person in her friend group, she says, who cautioned others not to wait too long. Having problems conceiving as a young, healthy woman was not something she expected would happen to her. She discusses asking for a family-minded commitment from her boyfriend at a young age. I just found out my sister in law is pregnant too. She is due one month after me. This is my first child and she already has a child. I'm not normally a selfish person but I have to admit I'm a little upset she will give birth so close to me. She is very competitive to begin with and now I feel she'll be competitive with the pregnancy too. Before I even knew she was pregnant, I was mentioning names I like for the baby, and she told me if I use the name grace she won't talk to me. Please help. I feel so guilty because I feel this way. I want to be happy for her but it just seems like she stealing my thunder. I get where you're coming from. My SIL copies everything we do, and she's very egotistical. She's not pregnant yet, which is surprising, because she does whatever we do."

But, I know she's not the only one who's ever done this. I just wish she'd stop trying to compete with us, and let us have our own experience. I think we all need to talk to her about it, and set some boundaries. We don't want to be competitive with each other, we just want to be happy for each other."
