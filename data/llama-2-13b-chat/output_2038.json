        "Summarize the following story in first person: About a month ago I was sitting at work and doing my usual thing. It was a completely ordinary day like any other. Then, out of nowhere, I get a text from someone who I had been good friends with in high school. It was completely out of nowhere, and was spurned by them thinking they saw my brother out and about earlier in the day and they wanted to tell me about the encounter. I had not thought about this friend in a long time since we had gone our separate ways once we were in college. It\u2019s not that we were not good friends and I didn\u2019t like her, we had just fallen out of touch over time. This text led to a pretty long conversation over text about what we had been up to in life, where we had been, what we\u2019re doing. We were catching up and it felt like no time had passed since we last spoke. It was great to get back into the swing of talking to her again so easily. This conversation led to another, which led to another, which led to us making plans to meet for beers, which led to us now talking to each other pretty regularly and seeing each other a couple of times a week. Since we became so close so fast, I am starting to wonder what life would have been like if we had never stopped talking and being friends in the first place. Or maybe this falling out of touch let us grow as people and we were destined to be in each other\u2019s lives now instead of an ongoing thing. We\u2019ve grown a lot as people over time and now we are much more compatible than we used to be. I actually kind of like her, and I\u2019m starting to think she may feel the same way about me. I am pretty delighted she decided to randomly text me that day out of the blue. I can\u2019t wait to see where this goes."
