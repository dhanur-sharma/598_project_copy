        "Summarize the following story in first person: When my youngest son was about 2 or 3 years old we went for a walk near my home.  I live out in the country and it wasn't safe to push a stroller on the gravel along side of the road so I would push the stroller across the road and on the sidewalks in the little cemetery.  It was a beautiful spring day, the sun was shinning and my son was sniffing the air and it wasn't long and he asked me what that smell was?  I knew what it was but decided to ask him, what do you think it is?  He replied I didn't know dead people smelled so good!  I couldn't help but chuckle and I had to show him where the wonderful smell was coming from.  There was a little shed in the back of the cemetery where the lawn mower was kept and behind the shed was a lilac bush in full bloom.  The smell was being blown in the wind and it was delightful.  My little son just assumed it came from the people that were buried in the cemetery.  It was so funny and I will always remember that day.  Out of the mouths of babes, as they always say!  To this day whenever I smell lilacs I recall that beautiful spring day and our walk in that little cemetery.  Time passes quickly but memories linger on like the beautiful smells of a warm spring day.  We just never know what each new day will bring.  When we have children its amazing what they will say.  Our lives are enriched by everything in nature."
