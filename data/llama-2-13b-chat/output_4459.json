        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was driving on the highway with some fellow co-workers back in Spring.  We were all headed up to the new building our company opened up to make sure that we had everything we needed for contractors, power, and other needs.  It was not a bad day weather wise.  It was slightly cooler than normal, but overall a nice day.  The traffic wasn't too bad either.  Heading into Boston during a work day can be frustrating with all the traffic you have to deal with.  We were probably about a half an hour from our destination.  I was sitting behind the driver, my boss was to the right of me and there was another co-worker in the passenger seat.   All of a sudden I heard my co-worker whom was driving say, 'oh crap!', and I looked forward and saw a box truck slam on its break.  Then like a bullet I saw a Fed-ex truck swerve.  From there it went right to left and went head on into a guard rail.  Time seemed to slow at this time, almost like in a movie.  The fed-ex truck's back end came inward and the truck began to flip over the rail.  It was all so surreal.  The traffic stopped and we saw the drive unclip his belt and hit the roof of the truck from within.  At that point we felt that he was good to go and other passer bys stopped by to help him.  I did see the story about it that evening and the highway was shut down for some time and no one was injured. That is something is something I won't ever forget!"
