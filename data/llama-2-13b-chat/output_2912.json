        "Summarize the following story in first person: My oldest son became a teenager 2 months ago. I still cannot believe my baby boy is a whopping 13 years old! It seems like time flies by so quickly these days. Hopefully he enjoyed his party, playing laser tag with all of his cool friends. Minecraft and pizza...what ever happened to Paw patrol and super heroes? Has he really grown up so much! Not to mention the poor party planner dropping one of the pizzas all over the gift table. What a mess! I just hope he enjoyed himself, it wasnt so long ago that I remember when he was just a little boy, asking his mommy to kiss his cuts and bruises. Now, well now he doesnt even want me to be around. Goodness forbid I was at the party trying to help or be a part of his life. Its like as soon as he hit that milestone he stopped wanting me to be in his day to day. I just want him to be my baby boy again. I love that he is growing and becoming his own person, but I just am broken down by not having my little man around anymore. I guess this whole experience is about my growing as well. Its the hardest feeling to have, letting your little bird try and fly on his own. I just hope that he knows that no matter what, his mommy will always love him."
