        "Summarize the following story in first person: In May, my boyfriend's mother got news that she was very ill. She went to the doctor's to get cleared for a hip surgery, and they did some sort of stress test and found that she had some arterial blockages. She went for further testing, and they found that she needed to choose between having open heart surgery to clear the blockages or put stents in to improve the situation. This news impacted me because it really impacted my boyfriend, and made me think about when my dad was sick a few years ago. His mother didn't want to have surgery, and said that if it was her time to go, it was her time to go. She eventually (July) chose to have the stents put in, and went to a second doctor's appointment, where the information was relayed... and they basically told my boyfriend, his sister, myself and his mother that there was a good chance she'd have a stroke on the operating table based on the initial results. To make a long story short, she still went in for the surgery at the end of August, but when they put the scope in for the stents, they found that there was no blockage as described - and that she didn't need to have the surgery. The doctor was astounded at how different the truth was from what was shown on the initial testing. This impacted me again because it meant that we'd been worrying for months about nothing. It made me realize that getting a second opinion is always necessary, because sometimes even medical professionals can make mistakes - that result in unnecessary worries for people for months, as well as end of life planning that doesn't need to be done. It made me scared, it made me sad, and it made me mad. I we were preparing for the worst for nearly 3 months, and it turned out that none of it was necessary. I'm always going to think about this when I go in for medical procedures and appointments now. Medical professionals might be able to help a lot of people, but in this case, they didn't at all. His mom was just stressed for months, the whole family was stressed, and it was what we thought was a race against time - even though it wasn't."
