        "Summarize the following story in first person: Two months ago my anxiety was really getting the best of my way. I wasn't in the best shape mentally. I just thought I could bide my time and hope for things to get better on their own. That's what I kept telling myself every time it got bad. Ultimately though, it started to come to a head where either I was going to improve myself, or it was going to consume me and make it even worse. I told my friends I needed a day away, and even that was tough. I hated disappointing anyone. That is probably one of my worst features. I try so hard to please everybody, at the expense of myself sometimes. I just want everyone to feel happy and pleased. But, that's not realistic. I need to take care of myself, at least more than what I have been doing. I wanted to use that day as a means of resetting. I needed to just recharge and keep to myself. That whole day was hard because I wanted to give into my compulsions but I tried desperately not to."
