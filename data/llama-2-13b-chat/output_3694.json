        "Summarize the following story in first person: While we were at my parents for this trip, we went out to one of my favorite new shops that sells vintage toys from my youth. It was nice seeing my kids enjoy all of this as much as I did. They had all of the Masters of the Universe, Ghostbusters, and Wrestlers that i played with. They had a ton of records that my dad also enjoyed looking through which was nice. ALl of the kids were overwhlemed by al lof the toys and it did my heart good because I could empathize with tha tfeeling. This is something that we make a habit of doing now whenever we go in there. It's right by the park that we went to for my moms birthday that had fishing, boating, and mini golf. I miss being there, bu tthese trips are special and evoke so much nostalgia for me. I wish we could go more often. The prices are high and the kids always want a lot. But to maintain the feelings it gives me I always pay up plus it helps the small business. The hard part is the kids don't really play with the toys anymore once we ge thome. I think they are feeling kind of what I am in that this store is a marker of happiness because they are with their grandparents. We always try to hit up all the small businesses when we are in. This one is the one that brings the kids the most joy though."
