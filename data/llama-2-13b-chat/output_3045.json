My electricity was behind  two payments and my lights were cut off.  I tried to get enough money for my minimum payment the week prior by picking up odd jobs and turking. Honestly I didn't have the time to dedicate to raising extra funds. Between getting the kid ready for school, taking my mom to her appointments and already working a 60 HOUR week, how am I suppose to get anything else done? I need sleep. My brother said he couldn't help at first, go figure.  What grown man live with his mom and sister and can NEVER contribute. He finally said he could help after the lights we already cut of and they were demanding full payment.  At least I was able to get some money out of him. What I want to know is where the money magically appeared from. He is so spoiled. It's most definitely moms fault. I am not putting up with this shit for much longer and you can bet you LIFE on that!"
