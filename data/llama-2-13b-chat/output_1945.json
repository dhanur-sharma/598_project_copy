        "Summarize the following story in first person: Mother's Day weekend was approaching. My oldest child's birthday generally falls near that date and we often have out of town family, mine and my husband's parents, down for her party. This year, my child's birthday fell mid-week and I decided that I'd like to have the party the weekend after Mother's Day so that I could enjoy a Mother's Day with just my small family. I booked a Mother's Day tea party for my daughter and me to attend on Saturday then on Sunday we'd all spend the day together. The tea party was lovely and I was glad of my choice. Sunday came and my children, husband and I left home early for a family outing. On our way, I decided to send a Happy Mother's Day greeting to friends in my cell, my MIL and my own mom included. A short time later, I received a voice memo from my mother, crying, telling me that she hopes my children never treat me as I do her. I was dumbfounded. I called to see what was wrong and my mother gave me a laundry list of reasons that she was upset with me, some dating back to my wedding 7 years ago. Historically, I'm apologetic and sheepish with my mother but this time I was firm and set boundaries with her as to what I will not accept when it comes to my choices and my family. I couldn't believe that I stood up to her but it was certainly time. I feel like this, while difficult, will help us have a more genuine relationship moving forward. It is important to me to be valued as an equal. I have a choice when it comes to what I will and will not allow, no matter who the other person is."
