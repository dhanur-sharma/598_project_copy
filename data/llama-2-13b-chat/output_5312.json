        "Summarize the following story in first person: This happened to me last week. I was going to leave to go to the store but it stared raining immediately after I put on my jacket. I did not like that. I was quite upset because I was going to get my favorite ice cream at the time.  My plans on having good time and watching movies with my kids were ruined. Luckily it stopped raining right after I was ready to take off my stuff. I was magical moment. I took the opportunity when rain stopped and proceed with going to the store after all. That was the right choice of mine. I got to the store in 30 minutes on my bike. It was almost a breeze. When I got there I could not believe that the store had my favorite strawberry ice cream there, I was shook. I have not had any strawberry ice cream since the beginning of this year, I was super exited. Could not wait to bring this treat to show and to share it with my babies. I took all of them, there were like 10 of them. When I came home I was in super good mood. My kids came running to the door when they seen me with nothing but the ice cream. We all had a great time eating strawberry ice cream and watching super hero movies, it was a day to remember."
