        "Summarize the following story in first person: As I sit here and think about the past year on the eve of a new one, I start to think back to three months ago.  The reason I say this is because at that time something happened that changed my outlook on life.  My husband and I were driving on a trip to Boston up north and almost got into a car crash. This was a turning point in our lives to be honest. I say this also because that alone changed my way of thinking on two fronts. The first thing that came to mind was how fragile our lives are and that was scary. Also how quickly things change, almost in the blink of an eye.  During that time it happened I was taken aback because I just kind of coasted. I nor him ever even thought about life without each other so that alone scared me. I looked at things differently after that day and so did he.  We started to focus more on the time we have here because having that happen was eye opening to us both. I almost cried as I watch the night end tonight as we go into the New Year because if things had gone different in that crash him or I could be alone. So in turn be thankful everyday you are alive because things can change that in a second. Also take in each day and cherish what you have and know that it can end just as quickly. Please also don't live in fear because life is short so love the time you have here. Lastly, the most important thing is while it's okay to be scared live life, but give yourself time to realize that you need to love and hold the ones you have everyday and thank the lord you have that time."
