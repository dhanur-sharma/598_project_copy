        "Summarize the following story in first person: My younger nephew called me two weeks ago.  He told me his parents have bought him a huge kite. It was actually a yellow one! In addition to that, it was Paul Frank styled. He told me they wanted to pass by my home at Sunday to try it out. It was a very windy week so the moment seemed appropriate! I couldn\u00b4t wait for their visit. Finally, Sunday came. We agreed that we would try to fly the kite first and have lunch after that. There is a wide open area behind my home so kites can easily be flown over there. The only problem was that, if a lot of people showed up to fly kites, there might be accidents. But when we went outside there were just a few people so it would not be easy for kites to get tangled with each other. Besides, it\u00b4s been over two decades for me since I last flew one! So we made the first tries. It took some time for the kite to lift up. On time, it started gaining height. The wind was wonderful and finally, the kite majesticly rose in the sky!! It was a wonderful time for us to remember. After that, we have one of the happiest lunches we ever had."
