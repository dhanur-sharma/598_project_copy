        "Summarize the following story in first person: Earlier today my day was in chaos.  The day started out fine, I woke up early and already had all my tasks and errands written out to start.  I had a lot to do but I had just enough time to pull it all off and make the day a success.  One of the difficult parts of the day was getting started on some of dishes for dinner later.  I had a lot of tasks that involved things in the house and wish I could get started on them right away.  But one of the dishes I was making for dinner later required marinading for a few hours and another dish needed to be in the slow cooker all day.  There were several ingredients I didn't have.  So I had to go to the grocery store first so I could get those dishes started.  I looked at a couple grocery stores ads and saw that one had a couple of sales that fit the ingredients I needed.  When I go to the store I notice that there are no signs at the store indicating the deals in the ad.  When I went to check out my fears came to fruition when my discounts and free items were all rang in full price.  I told the clerk about the deals in the ad and they had no idea what I was talking about.  They took a long time to ask another person, who also did not know.  Then they walked all the way to where I got the product only to find there was nothing there either, which I tried to tell them.  Then I went to the front of the store and got the ad to show them.  This prompted them to ask a senior member of the staff who quickly said yes of course give them the discount.  This added so much time to a trip that was supposed to be quick.  Not to mention I was in the checkout line for a long time because the worker was kind of slow.  Once I got home tried to make up time by prepping the food as fast as I could.  But in the end everything food wise was delayed because I got everything in the slow cooker and in the marinade that much later.  I also was unable to do a couple of things like check email or make a music playlist for the rest of the days errands.  I hate feeling rushed, it stresses out my whole day and I end up doing things worse than if I was relaxed."
