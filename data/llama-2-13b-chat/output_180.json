        "Summarize the following story in first person: I moved to US when I was 26 years old with my family. Since then, I missed my mom a lot. We visited each other a couple of times but lately the money was tight. After saving some money, I was able to get my parents to come here and visit us again this year. We had a great time together as a family. Somehow, I really wanted to celebrate her birthday this year. I usually just send some money home for her birthday but this time I want to make it special. I invited my sister and her in law to our house. I asked my sister to take her to the mall while I was preparing everything.  I bought the food, drinks and a cake. She blew the candle and made a wish just like a child. She was smiling and laughing all the time. She admitted that was the first time someone bought a cake for her and we were in tears. I felt so bad that I never really pay attention to her needs. I felt that we need to appreciate her more and make her feel special. Especially after I am a mom, I am more aware about her struggles and her feelings."
