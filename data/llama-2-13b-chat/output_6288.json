        "Summarize the following story in first person: I have no idea why?  We have nothing of major value. I notice the locks on my old ass windows are broken. On my curling iron in the bathroom, on my sisters toys. So, later on I take the trash out to the dumpster in the alley. I realize this is what the person used on my door to try and pry the lock. I was so pissed and scared, coming to the realization this woman has been in my house. She has been in here multiple times. Cut to the chase; I called the cops, they came out, talked to the neighbors and left. I shoved a chair up against my back door, and then I noticed her coming again. I called for my dad, grabbed my sister, and ran as fast as I could out the front door. When I grabbed my sister clothes and diapers, I found an empty gallon of weed killer in my daughter's room. Why would this be here? Nonetheless, In the time it took us to run, wait on the cops and come back, they had re-entered my house again. I begged my parents to move but we never did. I still am scared. What can I do?"
