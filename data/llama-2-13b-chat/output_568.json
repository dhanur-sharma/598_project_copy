        "Summarize the following story in first person: Watching Game 7 of the Stanley Cup series with my dad and seeing our team win is something I'll remember forever! EVen four months later the event stilll stands out! Although tickets to the Stanley Cup game for me and Dad's favorite team were super expensive, we still celebrated the big win as if we were in the stands!! We saw the team score the winning points at a watch party. But, no matter where we were it was great to witness our team score such a big win with my Dad. I can almost still hear his cheers of excitement. It was also pretty crazy to see how everyone lept off their feet when the clock ran down to zero and our win was cinched! Everyone was ecstatic!! I saw a couple of guys in jerseys crying with excitement and pride and hugging each other- I didn't realize how much this meant to some people! My dad gave me a great big high-five and then started doing the same. to his friends. Then, I mimicked and held my hand up for \"some skin\" to anyone in arm's length. I got slaps. and hugs from everyone around during those first ten minutes when everyone's adrenaline was through the roof! Even the sports casters on the television seemed blown away at the victory. It was so much fun to celebrate this monumental sports. win for our city with my Dad and all the other fans in support!"
