        "Summarize the following story in first person: My daughter finally married her longtime boyfriend. It was a very special day for her, but it was special for me, too. I had never seen her so happy. I vividly remember the look on her face. It was a rare look of utter joy and being fulfilled. It's almost like I was feeling it with her. And it was a big decision for her. Her life was taking on a new direction and a new meaning. And having family and friends share her joy just made the occasion one the most memorable days for me. My daughter and my son had been experiencing a rift in their relationship.  But I think all the sheer happiness of the day allowed the two of them to sit down and hash things out. It was kind of awkward, though. They ended up disappearing off together for about an hour. My daughter's new husband was like, \"Where is my wife?\" So it was nice that that happened, because I wasn't sure it was ever going to. And I have to wonder if it would have been able to occur had not some Happiness catalyst been there to cause it."
