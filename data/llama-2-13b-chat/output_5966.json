        "Summarize the following story in first person: April 30, 2019Today was a very memorable day.  It started at 7:50 AM when my group members and I gave a presentation in our stats class.  The presentation seemed to go fairly well and I am not too worried about my grade as I do not need a high one to maintain my A.  Afterwards, I went to the health science building and began studying for my anatomy practical/exam.  My grade this was VERY important.  I had to make at least an 88 to maintain my A in the class.  I had began studying HARD two weeks prior and had spent nearly 20 hours over the weekend digging through cadavers trying to make sense of it all.  Now, I only had 5 more hours to prepare, so I made the most of my time by focusing hard on the fringe topics that I currently knew the least about.  As studied, time accelerated until I got to the point where I needed to go change into my scrubs.  I showed up outside of the lab, behind a line of about twelve of the fifteen other students.  This meant that I would likely not go into the practical until the second round (we only had about nine stations and fifteen won't fit).  This was a bittersweet realization, as I both wanted to get it done and also wanted to study a bit more.  This indeed came to pass, as I waited another 30 minutes after arriving before the practical began.  During this, I spoke with one of classmates quite a bit about her dog, as I shuffled back and forth over my notes. Once the practical began, things seemed to go very well until about the eighth question.  Suddenly, the professors had rearranged a cadaver's cranium and disarticulated the mandible to provide a different vantage point of many structures than we had seen during the dissection itself.  I did my best and moved on, but not before several more hiccups were thrown my way.  After the practical, we moved on to the written exam portion.  This was the hardest one to date and I had to attempt to make sense of bits of information I had in my head as the seam together into a coherent biological system.  Nothing felt as good as I wanted it to.  I was afraid that I was going to lose my A.  After wrapping up my exam, I slowly walked up to turn it in, got my things, and left.  As I walked out to my car, I decided to check my phone and the grade for my practical had already been posted.  I got a 98!  Elated, I went home and celebrated!"
