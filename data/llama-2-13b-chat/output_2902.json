        "Summarize the following story in first person: An event that is specifically memorable to me is when went to my brother's graduation. It was significant to me for many different reasons. I had to take a plane to get there. It was the first time I had ever been on a plane. Also, my brother was graduating from boot camp. It was my first time experiencing that kind of graduation. I was surprised by how different military culture is from every day life. Something I specifically remember from the event was during the ceremony we had to stand and sit down at specific times. I was surprised by how precise everything was. I also was surprised by how different my brother seemed after he graduated. He was more mature and I could tell the experience changed him a lot. I was really proud of him for this achievement. Over all it was a good experience. It also, allowed me to experience many different firsts. I will remember it for a long time and it fill definitely be something my family talks about often."
