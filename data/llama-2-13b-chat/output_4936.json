        "Summarize the following story in first person: The funny thing is my husband always told me that when he first met me he wanted me to be the mother of his child, even though he already had Tim from his previous marriage.  It makes me laugh now when I think about it because with Laila and Marcus from my previous marriage, I always said to him those two were the best behaved children ever, and I didn't want to jinx my luck by having any more.  I couldn't believe how insistent he was that we just had to have another baby to unite our kids and complete our little blended family.  Sure enough though after months of trying to convince me that this would be good for us, I finally gave in to the idea.  But, then I thought about it again, diary:  Did I really want to have to worry about Pediatricians again?  Daycare costs again?  Especially after I'd gotten comfortable with having older kids that I practically grew up with!  I was in such a good place.  The weird thing about it all is that I remember he and I were together and I just knew what he was trying to do.  At first, I was skeptical, but then I began getting excited about the possibility of having his baby.  After all we didn't have one together, and our blended family was working so well that we both knew it was right. I just couldn't believe how upset I was when I took the first of a few tests and it came out negative.  Eventually, I began to accept the fact that at 35 years old, I didn't NEED to have another baby at all, and this was life's way of saying that I wasn't suppose to have another baby.  I was OKAY with that Diary!!!  We enjoyed our life and family time. It's just funny how Dana's baby shower changed it all for us for some reason.  When I came home that night from Norfolk, and I began telling him about the shower and how excited Sasha and her husband were and how cute the gifts were, I could see just feel the idea of having another baby getting him worked up and excited.  I guess I shouldn't have been surprised that that was the night our little man was conceived!  After 2 eventful years, it took me going to a baby shower for a friend for our son to decide that he wanted to come into the world too!  Life is so crazy, but I wouldn't have it any other way."
