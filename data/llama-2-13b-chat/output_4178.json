Before I went grocery shopping I made sure to check that my computer and flash drive was in my back seat I couldn't remember if. I had brought it down with me from the office. There was some important work I had to finish and documents that I needed to go over and sign. It was there so I didnt have to worry much. Now I am at the grocery store getting things from my list. Then I remembered that I left my windows down and doors unlocked and it was raining. I instantly thought my stuff would be stolenor get wet. I had planned to come back to the car when I remembered that I did leave it unlocked. I was already in line with all my groceries waiting to pay. The angle I standing I wasn't able to see my car from the store. Soon as everything was rung up and paid for I tried to hurry and get to my car. Everything looked normal from afar but when I got there I realized it was gone. My computer and flash drive were stolen from me. However I was able to contact my insurance company and was compenstated for what was taken."
