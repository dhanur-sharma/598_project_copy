        "Summarize the following story in first person: Within the last two weeks I rented a cabin for my family for the weekend. I invited my parents and my in-laws along with my husband and son. We also invited my husbands aunt and uncle to join us for the day, not the entire weekend. The cabin we rented was on a lake with direct access to the water. The cabin had a full kitchen, bathroom and two bedrooms. It was expensive but we don't go on vacation often so we felt it was worth it and we were able to include a lot of our family on this adventure. One of the most memorable moments was when I convinced my mother in law to go kayaking. She is a heavy set lady and doesn't  like to partake in psychically activities. I talked her into going into a double kayak with my husbands aunt, we will call her Sue. My mother in law agreed and her and Sue went out into the lake the double kayak. I was in a single person kayak and kayaked along side them. My mother in law, to my surprise, did really well paddling the kayak and keeping her balance. After a short trip around the marina we headed back to shore. I quickly got up out from my kayak and pulled the boat to shore. Sue and my mother in law pulled up on the beach. Sue got out fairly quickly and then grabbed  her phone to record video footage of my mother in law getting out of the kayak. She appeared to be stuck and was complaining. A roar of laughter came from everyone and when offered help by my husband, her son, she scolded him. He stepped away to let her find her own way out of the kayak. The kayak was at a decline and she didn't want to get her feet wet. After a few minutes of laughter Sue helped her out of the kayak and she did not fall in the water. We laughed about the situation for a long time but I was proud of her for trying to kayak as it was her first time in one."
