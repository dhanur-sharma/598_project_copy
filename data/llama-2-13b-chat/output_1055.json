        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was on my way to work in which I had to travel about 45 minutes to get to work. At that time I worked at Walt Disney World in the Art of Animation Resort as a custodian. I usually worked nights so I got to meet people that were coming back from the parks. I was doing my regular rounds when I came upon a couple who couldn't remember what they did with their room card. So, I helped them look around to where they had been and no luck there. I asked them if they know what their room number was and they said it was 1125. So I had to walk up to the front desk with them to see if they could get a new room key. The clerk typed in their information with the room number. Then to their surprise they could not find them in the system. So, the clerk did a few more things to see what was going on with their room situation. At that time they where getting very nervous and a little upset. This went on for a few more minutes with the clerk asking for help from his supervisor. Finally after the supervisor arrived she started looking some other places he could look up with his clearance. Come to find out that they where at the wrong resort and was staying at the resort next to the Art of Animation. Which was the Pop Century resort area. So, we got a golf cart to take them over to their resort area and was able to get in their room finally after about two hours of searching. They had not paid close attention to the surroundings when they arrived last night when they got to the resort. In the end it was a happy ending after all."
