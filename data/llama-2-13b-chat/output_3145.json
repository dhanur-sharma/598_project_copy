        "Summarize the following story in first person: Today I went out to eat some sushi with the family. We were celebrating a promotion for my brother's job. We had been planning on going to this place for a while. When we got there, we all ordered all you can eat. We had a great time trying out their signature rolls and the food was delicious and quickly served. We all relaxed and had a good time. After that we came home and had some tea and cake that my mother had prepared the day before. It was a Russian Napoleon cake. We watched some TV and talked about what we are planning to do with the house. We wanted to fix up one of our bathrooms and renovate it. My mother had all sorts of ideas about what we can do for this place. My brother had his own and they had some disagreement. I suggested my own ideas as well. This whole day made me thing about how much we have lived through as  a family. It is important to keep this going."
