        "Summarize the following story in first person: Four months ago I officially retired from the United States Army after 20 years of service. When I originally enlisted at the age of 18, I only planned on serving for 4 years. I planned on earning the money for college, saving up my money for life expenses, and gaining some training that would aid in better employment. Instead I found myself going career. A big factor was the conflicts overseas. What people do not understand is that your co-workers are more than just your co-workers or friends but family. You serve together for several years your family aid one another. You go through the thick and think, the good and bad together. In Iraq I witnessed many of my family members wounded or killed. How could I turn tail and leave the service after all that I had seen and been apart of? This is why my retirement was so hard to accept because I still feel as if I can give but I know it is time to move on. At my retirement my unit presented me several awards. I received multiple handshakes and hugs goodbye. It was my family coming out to say goodbye to me since I may never see most of them again in my life. It is a scary moment as I am now faced with the question of what to do with my life after spending over 20 years being told what to do and when to do it. I've never cried at work but a former patient of mine that I treated through 40 surgeries traveled 1300 miles just to appear at my retirement and say goodbye. That is how close your co-workers become. They're family."
