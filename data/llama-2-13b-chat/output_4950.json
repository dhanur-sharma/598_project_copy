        "Summarize the following story in first person: My anxiety has been doing amazingly recently. I still visit my therapist for time to time but only when I feel like times are really tough which is not as often. My thoughts are really becoming my own it seems. I would get so many thoughts about relationships, family, and even death which truly frustrated me. I learned that I had to be responsible for my own happiness. To balance everything out I had to show gratitude in my life. Most of fears were routed about the future and what would be instead of the moment. I had to realize that my life what fine to begin and that I have so many things going for. I have my parents, friends, and colleagues who support me like crazy. Even my dog is my buddy.  I have a home, a few jobs that I thoroughly enjoy doing at school and at outside of school. One of the hardest things about my anxiety is my singleness as I have never had a serious relationship. Even writing this I do not feel that shame that I used to. Every once in a while I would have a weak moment if I ever go on social media and see a friend or associate in that relationship or get engaged. I realized that, thats not my life and my own situation will happen some day. I am applying for a PhD program so maybe Ill meet a guy then who knows. I can be 30 or 40 and it doesn't matter. Every couple has their happy moments and sad moments, but I am willing to wait to meet that right guy. Not for social media status, but for me and my life."
