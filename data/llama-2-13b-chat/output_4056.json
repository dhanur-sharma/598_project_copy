        "Summarize the following story in first person: From a young age I would always make friends with everyone. I believed that just because you looked different from me and or liked different things than me didn't mean that we couldn't find a way to connect on a common ground. With all that being said, I remember even finding a way to communicate with kids who were in ESOL. I would talk to the ones who knew some English to kids who didn't know English at all. I felt as though just because there is a language barrier doesn't mean that you can't find a way to communicate with them. Forwarding to January of this year, I was working in retail and I just felt like I wasn't fulfilling my life purpose. I also felt like wanted to get more out of life especially when it comes to helping people. I decided to enroll into a course to get my TEFL certification because there are many kids and adults who really want to learn English and I wanted to be the one to help them accomplish that. When I started my course I realized how much harder it was especially since I was juggling work, coursework, papers I had to write, demonstrations I had to perform, as well as tests/assessments. I also realized how gratifying it would be when I did finish schooling. A month ago I found out that not only did I pass my final exam but I also passed my course with honors. As soon as I received my certification I immediately started applying to TEFL jobs. I heard back from about five jobs but decided to move forward with one of them. I don't know very many people who can honestly say that they love their job or their career and I am grateful enough to be able to say that I do. The decision I made to get my TEFL certification has been the absolute best decision of my life."
