        "Summarize the following story in first person: July 15, 2019Today me and my husband sold our house! This is a huge day for us as we have been trying to get out of this neighborhood for years but coming up with money to move elsewhere was an issue. The papers are officially signed and the check has been written. The most surprising thing to me was that closing was so much easier than I had imagined it to be and I didn't realize how quickly we would receive the funds from the sale. We had all three of our kids in this house but it's time to move on. We have outgrown its size and this isn't the location in which we wish to continue raising our children. I cannot believe the house in which we started our lives together isn't our house anymore. The ending of this chapter is so bittersweet but now our lives are full of opportunity for the future. Our next task will be to find a new house for us all to live in. Our plan is to rent for a few years before we decide to buy again. The reason for this being we would like to come up with a bigger down payment so our monthly mortgage is less. Also, we are working to rebuild credit for a tough situation we got into a few years ago. I'm not sure what the market looks like for renting homes right now but I'm hopeful we can find something quick. We are so fortunate that the buyer of our home is giving us ample time to move out. It's a stressful situation but at least I have 2 months to find a place and don't have to settle on the first thing that becomes available."
