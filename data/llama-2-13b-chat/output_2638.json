        "Summarize the following story in first person: About four months ago, we made another family visit to India. We all knew this might be the last time we visited the country we had grown to love so much, because this time, the trip wasn't for happy reasons. Sure, I know, you're supposed to celebrate the lives of elders who die, but for me, losing my first grandparent wasn't something I could see a silver lining in. Grandpa lived in India, and Grandpa was dying. We first started coming to India almost 20 years ago, when I was a baby. My mom is Indian, born and raised in this wonderful country, but she moved to the United States to marry dad in her early 20s. Her parents stayed in the only land they'd ever known. In fact, Grandma and Grandpa had never even visited us back home in Alabama. We'd only ever traveled to them. We all wanted Grandma to move with us to the US when Grandpa died; he was the only family she had here in India, but she said she couldn't leave the only place she had ever lived. I sort of understood, but still, I couldn't see leaving Grandma behind when we flew home in a few weeks. The doctors estimated Grandpa only had a week or so left to live on the day we arrived in India four months ago. It was a long flight, and it felt longer because of the nature of our trip. Grandpa only lived for another day after we arrived. We got to say good-bye, and for that, we're all forever grateful. It's almost like Grandpa held on just long enough to see us, like he knew we were coming, and if he just fought a little bit harder and a little bit longer, we would all have so much more peace in his passing than we would have if we didn't get to see him one last time. We were supposed to stay in India for three weeks, but after Grandpa died just two days into the trip, my Dad, sister, and I changed our flights to head home after a week. Mom would stay for the full length of the trip to be with her mom and help her clean out Grandpa's things. Our last trip back to India was sadder than all the others, there's no denying that. There was no sightseeing, no gathering around the dining room table as we feasted on Grandma's cooking. There was no fanfare, no souvenirs, nothing but family and memories. And yet, it's my favorite memory of traveling to India. The days after Grandpa's passing were filled with memories and conversations, filled with laughter and filled with tears. It was, in so many ways, exactly what being a family is supposed to be."
