I am really proud of myself because going out on a limb like that isn't something I would normally do. I'm also really nervous about it. I feel like I really took a chance and maybe it will work out for me, but maybe it won't. I'm not used to just getting something done without talking myself out of it. I spend so much time just dealing with my anxiety that I don't always go out and live my life. I mean, what's really going to come of it anyway? It's just a Subreddit. The thing is, I don't start conversations. I'm just an introvert who keeps to myself. I'm out on a limb though! I'm branching out...taking risks. I hope it helps the anxiety. It can't hurt, right?"
