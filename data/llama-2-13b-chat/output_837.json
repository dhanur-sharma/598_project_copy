        "Summarize the following story in first person: About a month ago, I was at a wedding. I was really surprised when I saw the brides dancing. It was really awesome. I capture the moment by taking a picture. I know that they were really enjoying themselves at that moment. I have been having a hard time recently and seeing such emotion expressed like that really gave me jolt and made me realize what I had been missing out on. I want what they have. I want that kind of joy and happiness in my life. As I watched them I kept thinking how can I get there? How can I have this for myself? And now I have the picture that I took. They're smiling and happy and when I feel like I'm loosing touch with my goals I can look at it and get that feeling back and remember why I'm working for what I'm working for. It's given a new since of meaning to me. I know that even over the past month I have improved myself and my outlook so much. All I can do is thank these brides for sharing such happiness with me even if they didn't know it at the time."
