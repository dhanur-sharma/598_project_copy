        "Summarize the following story in first person: My MomI love my mom to the moon and back. She has chronic kidney disease for last 2 years. She has no one at her place to take care of her. I bring her to live with my family. After coming to my place she started trowing up badly, she could not keep anything in her stomach, not even sip of water. I had to take her to the emergency room in a point when she throw up 7 times in a row.  After testing everything and staying in the hospital for 40 days, doctor wanted to starts dialysis on her. I was not sure if I was making the right choice as it seems like doctors were trying to force dialysis on her. Now she is on dialysis and I am still wondering if I made the best choice for her, sometimes it seems like she is a money making machine for the dialysis center. Every time I take her to the center and I look around I doubt the doctor decision. The other day there were a social worker who works there said the same thing. Seems like I am giving them a permanent income source. I wish there are some alternative to the dialysis. They are working on artificial kidney. I hope it is available in the market soon. So that there will be no long wait for a transplant."
