        "Summarize the following story in first person: In March of 2019, I was released from a medium security prison in Racine, Wisconsin; I had served 25 consecutive months between this prison and two others. This was the second time I'd been sentenced to prison time, and hopefully the last! It was a bitter experience, but my day of release was liberating - pun intended - to say the least! I was sentenced to 2 years, 9 months due to an altercation I had with a Milwaukee police officer. I was extremely inebriated during the altercation - from a consecutive days of high DXM abuse - and barely recall any of it. Having been convicted of a same or similar charge in 2013 under identical circumstances, I knew upon sobering up that prison time was guaranteed. It was an awful experience, especially in the beginning. In short, I spent 5 months between the County Jail and the House of Corrections, then a few months in an intake prison, followed by about 6 months at a medium security location, and, finally, the remainder in Racine, where I completed the Earned Release Program to save myself about 9 months of incarceration. My release was exciting, though. G and R picked me up, we went to a dollar store, then to their house to eat and relax. It was endearing and pleasant; they are great friends. This experience has taught me about friendship and integrity, and I feel as though I've become a much better - and more complete - person, as a result. The bus ride from Milwaukee to Charlotte followed; I'd been looking forward to it for over two years! Chicago was my favorite stop, of course, but the mountains in West Virginia and Tennessee are beautiful. It was a long but relaxing bus ride, and this time around I knew that I didn't need to use drugs, as I'd felt in the past. I was allowed to stay sober and to enjoy the experience for what my brain found it to be under normal circumstances."

I was happy to be free and to be able to start my life over. I was also happy to be out of the state of Wisconsin, which I had grown to dislike. I was excited to start over and to make new friends. I was happy to be free and to be able to live my life as I saw fit, without the confines of a correctional institution. I was also happy to be able to experience the world without the influence of drugs. I was grateful for my friends, who had supported me throughout my ordeal. I was grateful for my family, who had also supported me. I was grateful for my freedom, and for the opportunity to start over. I was grateful for the experience, as painful and difficult as it had been, as it had taught me about myself and about life. I was grateful for the lessons I had learned, and for the opportunity to apply them to my life. I was grateful for the chance to start over, and to make the most of my life."
