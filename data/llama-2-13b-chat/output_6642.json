        "Summarize the following story in first person: When my partner came out as transgender to her parents, they decided to cut us off for a while.  Not financially (we are on their phone plan and gas card) but by unfriending us on social media, not coming to my ballet performance and not speaking to us.  I was more hurt by that than Ashley, because they have always come to my shows and there wasn't any reason for them not to, except to punish her.  Or her through me.  They actually moved to another city 2-3 hours away because of this as well.  The mother is very passive-aggressive and also has a history of overreacting to things.  When my partner was just out of high school and this came up, she drove into a wall and started to break down.  They also mentioned that she was embarrassing them because their friends had heard about it.  Things have gotten slightly better since then.  Her mother has re-friended me on social media and is speaking to us and has said moving was a big mistake.  But the subject of Ash being transgender is something they just don't talk about.  This has really hurt my partner a lot, but she's actually handling it pretty well.  She basically thinks if they don't want to talk about it or acknowledge it, then that's fine and they can just have a distant relationship.  And I agree.  If they aren't even going to try to love and understand their child, then they are a waste of time."
