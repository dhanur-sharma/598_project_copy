        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was only 2 months ago when my boyfriend surprised me with a mini-vacation to the beach in a town that I had never visited before. He knew that I had been super stressed from working too much and having to deal with family members and their problems. I  really enjoyed the vacation even when it stormed. Just the sense of peace and tranquility made me perfectly content. We swam in the ocean and learned about new animals. The town had their own cultural background also which was pretty cool. I thought I was going to get sunburned though. It would have been smart to bring sunscreen along but I had forgot it and there was absolutely no stores at all. I think we walked at least two miles before we made it to our campsite. I had my own peaceful quiet spot - a hammock. I could lay in the hammock for hours, reading or napping. It was the most thoughtful and special thing my boyfriend has ever done for me. In the end, I did not end up with a sunburn. I found a rare plant that the natives advised me was their remedy for sunburns. It eased the burn and soothed the pain away instantly. I hope to go back one day."
