        "Summarize the following story in first person: A couple of months ago, when I was bicycling to the bank, some jerks in a car shot me with a paintball gun. I was on the way back, and I noticed a car driving slowly next to me, and I heard a couple of sharp cracks, and I was startled, I thought maybe a tree had fallen or something. Very quickly I noticed a sharp pain in my back, and while this was going on,  I noticed one of the people in the car was leaning out the window staring at me. I saw her ugly brown face staring at me, and saw she was holding something. As it turned out, it was a paintball gun, and was still shooting at me. This 'disadvantaged' ethnic minority type had just injured me, but not badly enough, she wanted to shoot me in the face or something, so maybe I'd fall off my bike and get hurt real bad, as some form of liberal social justice. Well, I stopped my bike, and reached into my fanny pack to my own gun, a real one, and they quickly sped up their car and drove away. I considered taking a shot at them, but I realized it was unlikely I'd hit them, and so I decided against it. I was in a decent amount of pain by this point, but I decided to take a detour to the liquor store instead of going straight home, picked up a 6 pack of beer, and had the people at the store tell me how much paint and crap were on my shirt, and backpack.  As it turned out, my backpack had absorbed most of the shots, so it was the article of clothing that was most paint-soaked. I got my beer, and painfully cycled home. When I arrived I took off my backpack, and shirt, and observed the injury in the mirror, it was like there was a golf ball sized dent in one of the large muscles of my back, and a nice fist sized red mark surrounding it. I put some ice on the injury, drank my beer, and tried to sleep, though it really hurt. Since then, I've been more cautious about passing cars, and bystanders in general, and I've practiced getting out my gun more quickly in case something like this happens again. I've also thought about it a lot, if someone assaults me in a similar way in the future, am I prepared to respond to them with lethal force? The answer to that is yes, I only suffered a minor injury but if things had happened a bit differently I could have been hurt very badly, and it's only right, that surrounded by people who will hurt me badly for no reason at all, other than some vague ethnic/identity/liberal ideology, I have to be prepared to hurt them first, to protect myself, at all times."
