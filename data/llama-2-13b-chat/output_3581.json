        "Summarize the following story in first person: I completed an internship during the spring semester of my junior year in college in 2019. I worked in the International Tax group in the PwC Minneapolis office. The opportunities that I was able to experience there were phenomenal. I was able to see (and do) firsthand of my what future career will be like. The jobs that I have had before this didn't prepare me for the work that I was going to have to do. I thought, though, that my schooling would have made me ready. However, I pretty much went in there knowing nothing. I had to learn an immense amount in just three short months. I was exposed to many things that I would not have seen if I wouldn't have completed the internship. Although there was a lot of late night and work involved, there was definitely time for fun. Not only was the team that I worked on super fun, but they had weekly events planned. It could be a team lunch or something as simple as going for a quick walk as a team. The intern events were fun as well. We went bowling, volunteered, ate, and drank together. At the end of my internship I was extended a full-time offer to start after I graduate. I will go back to Minneapolis in the summer of 2021."
