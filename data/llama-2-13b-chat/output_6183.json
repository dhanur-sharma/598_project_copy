        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was the day after Memorial Day weekend in 2019. It was like any other day when it started. I had gotten up, showered and got myself ready for work. I then woke up my baby girl as she went to work with me everyday. We had breakfast together as a family, and I got her ready for the day as well. We then packed up and headed to work.  I had been working for the company for over 6 years and loved my job.  I had thought everything was going the same as always. Little did I know this particular day would change the path of my life going forward.  Once we got to work everything seemed completely normal.   I started my day as I did every day, by going through emails from clients and vendors alike and responding to their requests and needs. I processed all that needed processed.  It was no about 10:30 am, this time is about which is when my daughter likes to take her nap, so I grabbed her bottle from our bag and we sat in the rocker and she feel asleep. I put her down in her pack and play and continued to go about my work while she napped.  I was busy working away when I heard a soft knock on my office door.  I opened it and it was our HR Manager, she asked me to come over to the Owner's office.  So of course I complied.  As soon as I walked in the door I could sense it was not good news.  I sat down and the owne proceeded to tell me I was being laid off that very day.  I honestly do not remember hearing much more of what was said after that as I was just in complete shock! I was handed my final paycheck and sent on my way.  Still being in complete shock, I called my Husband first of course to tell him the news.  I then packed up our bag and left.  I knew as I drove away from there that this was permanent, they would not be asking me to come back if business picked up again.  I also couldn't believe how easy it was after dedicating over 6 years of my life to a company ow it could be over in less than 20 min."
