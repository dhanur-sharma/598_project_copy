        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was married to my husband in florida. we went to disney for our honeymoon. it was a magical time and we love our accomodations. we were there for a week. my husband had never been and we decided that we would stay at the french quarter which is a resort on property. we had a boat that would take us to downtown disney and buses to take us everywhere else so we neer had to drive. we ate at the nicest restaurants on property and for our honeymoon dinner we ate at the california grill. we were treated like royalty and we  were pampered by disney staff while we were there. we were treated to free fast passes and free food when cast members saw our pins to indicate we were honeymooners. We also started the vacation at a place called raglan road in downtown disney. there were dancers and music and it was irish themed. my husband is of irish ancestry so he really loved it. we were married at a little chapel right outside of disney under trees covered in spagnum moss. it was beautiful and everything was perfect. It was the most memorable event of my life and I feel so lucky to have been a part of it."
