        "Summarize the following story in first person: Now it was time to figure out what to do after college. I had to start a job hunt. I also had to start networking with people i have ever met in order to get job leads. A job search will no doubt have its ups and downs (and ups, downs, and ups again). To help you navigate the job hunt and, ultimately, land your first job, you\u2019ll need some direction. Get started by asking yourself these questions:What kind of job do i want,do i have work experience. Do i even know the industries I'm going to. Since i have no where to live i had to go back to my parents,i couldn't afford a apartment or just pay house rent or pay other bills ,i had to depend on my parents. Next morning i started looking for jobs in the internet and making applications,Calling friends. After a few weeks i was offered a job in a manufacturing company. A first job is special. There are a couple of reasons for this: the experience is burned in one\u2019s memory, it gives you the practice needed to fulfill other positions, and it teaches you about the value of money. Of course we do jobs around the house when we are young, like cleaning dishes, vacuuming, and doing laundry, but working for others for money gives off a different feeling. It was a cloth  manufacturing company. After a few weeks of practicing and getting grip on the work, my supervisor decided that I should work solo because she saw confidence in me, and I was confident as well that I could work by myself because I knew exactly what to do. When I started to work solo, I was given more heavy and hard work such as instead of ticketing price tags on shirts and t-shirts, now I had to ticket price tags on heavy jeans, jackets, school-bags, etc. I also had to pack those items in the boxes depending on the price, weight and size of the items. Once, I packed those items in the boxes by using tap-gun, I also had to put those heavy boxes on pallet and move it by using roller to a place where other employees would lift those boxes and put in trucks, which will send it to the stores. Despite being the youngest employee other employees were very friendly. Whenever i need help they were ready to help me out. After three moths i was promoted to higher position and my salary also increased since i was very hardworking and focused. Life was starting to feel better i had to move from my parents house and rent my apartment,i started also paying my bills is not that easy but i had to struggle and do other par time jobs. I had to also save in order for me to do other courses and grow my career."
