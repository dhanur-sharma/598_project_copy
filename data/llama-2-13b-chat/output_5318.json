        "Summarize the following story in first person: My friends Sarah and William have never been to the United States.  When William had the opportunity to interview at the Chicago branch of his firm he was able to work in a visit to us in Grand Haven Michigan.  One of the first places we spent the day was the beach at Grand Haven.  We haven't seen in each other in person for such a long time that we spent half the day just talking at picnic table in the shade while watching the windsurfers play.  My partner Jamie knew of a little place we could get great sandwiches and picked them up for everyone as we scouted out a place on the beach to set up for the day.  Even though the beach was busy it was very relaxing.     If you've never been to a winery I can tell you that Traverse City has some fabulous locations to visit.  This was on Sarah's wish list and we were more than happy to take them up North to experience everything the near upper peninsula had to offer.  We left in the late afternoon to check into our hotel to visit the wineries early the next day when they opened.  On the drive there we took a detour to stop at Sleeping Bear Dunes.  William is a hobby photographer and really wanted to see a sunset from this vantage point.  It was a trek to the best location but it was amazingly worth it.  I think we were all ready to a good nights rest after the travel and hiking that day.  The wineries the next day were equally amazing and we learned a lot about the wines are made.  At least a couple of us enjoyed ourselves a little too much so it was a great idea that we'd decided to Uber from the hotel and back again.  They have some amazing restaurants in TC so after we had a couple hours to recover we took them to out favorite spot in town.  It was pretty busy for being the middle of the summer so we had to wait a little bit, but it was worth it.  They specialize in locally grown and sourced foods and really care about the quality and presentation.  We were happy our friends could experience this on their first trip to the states.      With only a few days of their trip left we took them up to Mackinaw Island for a day trip to experience what it's like to ride in a horse drawn carriage, and to ride on bikes to get where you need to go.  We had so much visiting all of the charming shops and taking in the scenery.  We were fortunate we had gorgeous weather that wasn't too hot for June.       We had such an amazing time visiting with out Irish friends that we're already talking about finding away to visit them in Ireland before they potentially end up moving to the states.    We're fortunate they were able to visit us in the summer when our state really shines!  Maybe we'll take them skiing in December if William ends up getting that transfer."
