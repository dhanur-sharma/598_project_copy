        "Summarize the following story in first person: 4 months ago, hubby was laid off from a job that he really loved and has been doing since he graduated college. Although we are all at a loss, it is affecting him more than anyone else. I see him walking around the house like he\u2019s lost, not knowing what to do at points. I joke with him saying now that you have soo much free time you don\u2019t know what to do with yourself. We have to joke about it because if we don\u2019t it gets depressing. I had to become the breadwinner in the family, but what I bring home is nothing compared to what hubby did. We are ok for now because he received a nice service package, but that will only last for a few more months. I\u2019m at a loss at how to help him really, he has always been my support system and now when he needs me, I\u2019m not sure how to help. He has been filling out application after application, going to interviews like its no tomorrow. He says it\u2019s just like it was before he got hired at his last job. But i see the stress and worry on his face, he\u2019s not as young as he was, and what many employers want. I am amazed at his strength. He has not given up, he is determined. What an amazing man I have married. To be able to stay calm and keep pushing is inhuman and something to be admired and loved. And I believe I love him more now. I was surprised when he turned down a job that paid the same, but was in a different state. He said it wasn\u2019t worth the move and moving his family for the same amount of money."
