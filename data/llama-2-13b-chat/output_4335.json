        "Summarize the following story in first person: It has taken me years but I have finally done it, I got into Grad School! It feels surreal to finally be able to complete what I started years ago. I had really started to believe that I might never get the opportunity to do so and that was ok but I am just ecstatic that I've been accepted. I really can't say that I've had a bad life, my two kids are wonderful, but having them did slow my progress toward my dreams down. I don't know if I'd say this out loud, and I don't mean to sound like I regret them but I could've reached this point years ago. Both of them now have moved out and accepted jobs to begin their careers and I couldn't be more proud of them, I hope no one ever sees that I feel they delayed me, I would hate for them to know that. It has taken me a long time to get to writing this down, Oh I hope I haven't forgotten any details about it since I got accepted. Lets see...I get to start the program in their biology program, I'm going to study aquatic bio, and I've been accepted as a research assistant too! Finally a break for me, I've been working and going to school for so long but now I'll be able to combine the two and focus almost entirely on my passion. I really hope that whatever work I do find makes a difference. I'm getting ahead of myself but I'm already imagining what I'm going to do after. I'd love to end up working federally for the US Forest Service as a Fisheries biologist, I've heard its competitive though but I suppose I'll cross that bridge when I get there. But it would be so cool to be outside working and studying stream ecology. Its just such a relief that all of my patience and hard work is finally paying off. I still have 2 months before I begin the program so I'll make sure to write more as I get closer to starting. I really need to make a point of writing at least once a week after I've started, note to self."
