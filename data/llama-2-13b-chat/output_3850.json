        "Summarize the following story in first person: I spent months trying to find a new hobby that interested me. I knew that I enjoyed art because it was a great way to express myself. I found the beauty in most art pieces even if it seemed confusing to others. Last week, I had an unexpected meeting with an art gallerist. We have become friends and I plan on visiting a lot more. Even my sister is plan on purchasing a painting by one of his top artists. I look forward to learning more about art and the history. He has taught me the meaning behind several paintings. My sister came to the gallery with me today and saw something she liked. She has shown an interest in painting. We always painted when we were children and I'm glad we found something in common as adults. My sister and I plan on making this a weekly thing by having lunch then visiting the gallery. With this new friendship with the art gallerist, I thought about inviting him to lunch with us. He can give us more information about purchasing art and the best pieces. Next week I plan on going because I have been wanting more decor in the family room. He suggested the perfect painting for me because it matches the color scheme."
