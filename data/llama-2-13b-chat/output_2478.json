        "Summarize the following story in first person: When my grandmother died two years ago, it affected me deeper than I knew. I wondered why I didn't cry at first, I think I was in shock. It really didn't seem real. I tried to go on with my routines and schedules to keep my mind occupied, but things slowly began changing. I started to not care about things as much as I did before. I began to withdraw from my friends. They would call and ask me to do things, but I would make up an excuse as to why I couldn't go. I would be busy with schoolwork or studying, but in truth I just wanted to stay at home and watch TV. My appearance began to suffer as well. There were many days when I didn't even want to take a shower and sometimes wouldn't. One of my closest friends started to become worried about me and told me that she thought I might be suffering from depression. Of course, I scoffed and laughed it off. One night about a month ago, I began to sob uncontrollably and began to feel really desperate and sad. I called my friend (the one that told me she thought I might be depressed) and talked to her for a couple of hours. After speaking about perhaps beginning counseling, I started to think that it might be a good idea. With my friend's help and the advice of my therapist, I was able to get through this surprising, and painful experience with depression. I feel I am now better prepared to handle these feelings if they were to come up in my life again."
