Hormones or not, i was feeling depressed and blue all this time. The doubt and fear in me kept creeping up. I was unsure about everything. However, today that all changed. Brandon felt our baby's movement for the first time today. He felt a movement in my tummy as he was kissing it. I was unsure if i felt that. But then that happened! A kick from him. Or her? I don't know if it is a him or her, as long as my baby is happy and healthy. We went to the church earlier today to say out thanks."
