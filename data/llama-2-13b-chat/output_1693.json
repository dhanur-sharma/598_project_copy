        "Summarize the following story in first person: A few months ago my teenage daughter and I are having a conversation about homeless people. She told me some of her friends said that giving homeless people money is a bad idea because all they buy with your money are drugs or alcohol. Now, I had heard that myself for many years but I wanted to see if it was actually true. I took my daughter downtown, and we found a nice old man in the park who was obviously homeless and looked hungry. I gave the man $50 dollars and walked away. My daughter and I pretending but we actually watched him to see what he was going to do. He left the park and made his way the local convenience store. My heart sunk thinking that maybe society was correct about people like him. My daughter had the same expression I did which was one of shock and disappointment. After about 10 minutes we saw the man with two bags filled with different items. He was heading back to the park. What we saw next has stayed with me ever since. The man went to a family who also looked like they were homeless and falling on hard times and I watched him take food and drinks and candy out of the bag. He has some chips himself and some drinks it's set with a family for a little bit talked to them. Seeing this man take the money to help another human being touched my heart and so many ways."
