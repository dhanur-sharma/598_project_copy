        "Summarize the following story in first person: For a long time, I was estranged from my extended family. I don't have siblings, or a relationship with my dad. I haven't been close with aunts and uncles for years. On my birthday, it would just be my mom and me. We'd go to a movie and out to eat together, and she would buy me a cake from the bakery. Since she died three years ago, I have felt very lonely on my birthday. During this time, I have also been rebuilding relationships with my aunt and uncle (her sister and brother) with whom I was very close as a child. This year on my birthday, my aunt and uncle joined my partner and me to see a movie together and go out to eat. My aunt and uncle bought me a cake, and we all came to my house to share it. Since then, we have celebrated my partner's birthday and my uncle's birthday, as well as having several activities together for Thanksgiving and Christmas. I am so happy and grateful to have this opportunity to have a close family again. It has really helped me cope with the loss of my mother and has given me a sense of belonging. I look forward to special occasions again, whereas for a while after my mom died I felt lost. All my mom wanted at the end of her life was for her family to be close again and I am glad that we have been able to achieve that. I feel that she is looking down on us and smiling."
