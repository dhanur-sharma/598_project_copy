        "Summarize the following story in first person: I am really stressed out. Today my sister and I found out that our father has been cheating on our mother for many months. My sister and I confronted him, but he lied about to directly to our faces. We saw them together in public. We saw the messages on Facebook - he left it up on our shared computer! He wasn't doing a very good job trying to even hide it from us. We are not sure if our mother knows yet, and we really want him to admit it to her. We don't want to have to bring the bad news to her - it will break her heart. The worst part is this woman is much younger than him. She's actually younger than my sister! That grosses us out a bit.  We are really not sure what further to do with the situation. I suppose in the next week or so if he doesn't come forward to our mother, we will have to do it for him. Our mother cannot go on with this lie. It isn't fair to her and she will need time to deal with it. I am so disappointed in him, as a person, as our father. I know people go through stuff, but to maintain something for so long is disgusting."
