        "Summarize the following story in first person: Two weeks ago I went into the doctor's office to get some results.    My heart was racing and pounding, and I feared for the worst and I could not even pretend that I was hoping for the best.   I had not been feeling well for awhile now.    I could tell by the doctor's composure that I should expect bad news.   He calmly explained with a cold detachment that I had cancer.   Yet, he tried to convey that I was lucky.   The cancer had been caught soon and we could treat it aggressively.   Survival rates were high and remission was very probable.   If this was lucky, I am fairly sure I did not want a part of it.   I knew I didn't feel lucky.   I had seen friends and loved ones suffer from cancer and now it was my turn;.   I am the next contestant on the Price is Right.     I took a moment to gather my thoughts and catch my breathe.   Okay, Doc, I have cancer, and  I want to fight it aggressively, and we are fighting to win.   I do not want any half-assed measures and I do not want slow and steady wins the race mentality.    The docotr looked at me preplexed.    I guess he thought I was in shock or something and trying to put on a brave front.   But, that really was not what it was.   I knew I was sick.   I knew something was wrong.   He just confirmed it.   Was it my worse fear,  sure, but, I had been planning on bad news for a couple of weeks now.    Waiting for all the diagnostic testing results to come in and the results of the biospy was the hard part.     Going through chemo and radiation and maybe a surgery seemed like child's play compared to the hell my own mind put me through while I waited.       Before I saw the doctor this morning I had a good cry, and as I was getting ready to leave ot see the doctor, I looked into the mirror and I told the Grim Ripper not today.    So, maybe it was a bit of bravado and maybe I was putting on a bit of an act, but  I do not attend to quit and I sure as hell do not intend to die."
