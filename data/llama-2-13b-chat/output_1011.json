        "Summarize the following story in first person: It's a great day, March 12, 2019. I welcome my daughter into the world. My wife and I have decided on the name Merrit Layne. My wife and I do not like typically names so this one fit. She was born 6 pounds 1 ounce. She was very long as a baby, 19 inches. I cried when i had my son and I wondering if I would cry for her. When she came, I could not hold back the emotions and cried like a baby haha, no pun intended. I held her for the first time, and it felt so great. Now I'm the biggest doting dad. I can not go anywhere or do anything with out talking about her. I'm so proud of her and I think she will do big things. I will always be there for her and have her back. She melts my heart when she looks and smiles at me. I have a nick name for her, it's Big Girl, hahaha."
