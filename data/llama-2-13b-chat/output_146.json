        "Summarize the following story in first person: This was our first family vacation. We went to the Outer Banks. It was the girls first time seeing the beach. They were roaming around the beach and enjoying the tides. My relatives were taking sun bath and were ready for other set of enjoyment. I was seeing the crazy crabs freaking around the paper kinda thing. It was very weird while seeing those things happening. The outer banks was quite impressive than expected. I was amazed by the infrastructure of the beach and it was driving us crazy. Apparently,my brothers were planning to take beach diving and I was no barrier to that. I loved the way everyone enjoyed around the beach. The girls with their beach suit were consuming juice and they were about to join the diving. To be honest, the most important thing to be noted was the pleasant and sunny climate which took the enjoyment to the another level. All of a sudden, there formed a dark cloud and it started raining heavily. It made us exclaimed. The thing came to my mind was I should definitely revisit this beach again alongside my friends or family. The resort near the beach was elegant and it made us awestruck with its beautiful outlook. When speaking about the food there, it never disappointed us. The food was delicious there and made it us felt fantastic. Overall, it is a must visit beach along with your family and friends. There is a theme park located near the beach and it was way far better than other theme parks in the country. The rides are very enjoyable there. It will make us more fascinated towards revisiting the park once again. After all, it will be a roller coaster one when taking all your friends and family there and enjoy the place."
