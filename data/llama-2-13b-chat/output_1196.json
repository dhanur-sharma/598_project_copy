        "Summarize the following story in first person: Went to my brothers for 2 weeks to help he and my sister in law with the kids. I was to take them to their swim practices every day and try to entertain them for the rest of the days. I took them to Carowinds, an amusement park, one day and to a putt putt another day. Treated them to dinner at times and took them to ice cream, also.  The days I took them to swim practice, I was able to go off  to McDonald's or shopped at Home Depot until their practice was over. Otherwise, I would stay and just play games or do a little work on my phone. Carowinds was a great time for all of us. Even though I don't care for rides much anymore, I did do some for them. We all enjoyed a full day there. It ended up being a great 2 weeks. The kids really took to me since I don't get to see them much. I think they fully enjoyed their Uncle. Now, my brother wants me to come down a little more frequent. Since I'm retired, I'm able to. We are going to set up another time for the fall."
