        "Summarize the following story in first person: One week ago I was sitting at my desk at work when a woman walked by that I had never seen before. Immediately she caught my attention since I was very attracted to her, but I simply went back to my work once a moment or two had passed. I was writing an email to a coworker when she walked by again. I looked out of the corner of my eye to see that she was heading toward the break room. I decided that the email could wait so I decided to mosey on over to the break room myself to get a cup of coffee, and if she so happened to be in there then that would be just great. I walk in and notice her standing at the coffee machine pouring herself a cup. I walk up and wait for her to be done when she goes to get a packet of sugar to add to her coffee when she notices the container is empty. She doesn't seem to know where the extras are stored so I open up and tell her that the spare sugar packets are stored in the cabinet above the sink. She thanks me and walks over to the previously mentioned cabinet. She thanks me and introduces herself as Pam, and I nod my head and tell her my name is Tim. As I pour myself a cup of coffee, I remark that I haven't seen her around the office before and ask if she just started working here. She responds that she is actually just here for the week as she is running a training seminar for people in the accounting department. I feel slightly relieved by this since that means if something does happen between us it won't be an awkward office romance, but at the same time I was a bit upset because she was only here for a week. I grab myself a cookie and offer her one to go with the coffee she is drinking. She accepts. Seeing as how it's Thursday and she will be done with her training seminar tomorrow, I decide to go for broke and do something I normally never do. I just straight up ask her if she would like to grab some dinner sometime with me. She smiles and gives me her phone number and tells me to text her later so we can work something out. I add her number and smile and tell her I should probably get back to work, but if she needs any more help finding other condiments to come find me at my desk and I'll be happy to help. She laughs and says she will be looking for my text. I go back to my desk and resume writing the email, but this time in a much better mood."
