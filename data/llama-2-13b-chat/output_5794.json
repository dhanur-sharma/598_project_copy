        "Summarize the following story in first person: On a nice day about two months ago I was riding my go cart. It was really fun to ride. It was really fast and handled really good. I was thinking to myself that this is the best go cart ever because I built it myself. I took it down this really bumpy road going really fast. After a few minutes I noticed I felt something cold and wet so I pulled over to check it out. I noticed a gas line off so I put it back on. when I went to start it back up it must have made a spark and caught on fire. At this point I had to just get away from it because the gas line that had just came off leaked on my shirt and pants. It was very scary knowing I could have just caught on fire and still could. I had to watch my new go cart burn completely up and could not do anything about it. On the other hand I was thankful to be alive and not injured in any way. I though back to when I was working on go cart and could not think of what did wrong because I know that I tightened clamp up on line. I was stuck miles out on a gravel road. I had to hide go cart in the weeds while I walked all the way home to get a vehicle to haul go cart back. I was really upset because of all the time and money I put into my project. but I knew it was to late and was very thankful it was just the go cart and not me that had caught fire."
