        "Summarize the following story in first person: This is a story about the myth of meritocracy. My brother and I grew up poor. One day he became rich by inheriting money. Instead of helping me, he started a business and underpays workers in order to make money while he sits around doing nothing. He won't give any of that money to me. He only offered me a job at his business where I'd make even less than I do at my current job. This is why we must move beyond capitalism. It makes people act like trash and exploit workers. The money he inherited is built on slavery in the first place. That's just how it works. The reason I didn't get any inheritance is because I didn't talk to my dad anymore, the one who passed it on. My brother really believes that he earned his place in society because of the messages constantly being blasted by the corporate / establishment media. He is a stunted human and if he weren't so rich I'd feel bad for him because of that. Hopefully he is able to see the error of his ways. When the revolution comes it might not be good for him."
