        "Summarize the following story in first person: There are few things in this world that are such an honor like graduating. And one of them is getting to do so in front of your friends and family. I was so nervous but knowing that they had my back was the best thing. Not to say there weren\u2019t some shenanigans that didn\u2019t happen that day. I remember going up to get my first award and are it so hard. I tripped over my own ground and did an unforgettable face plant. But at least the photographer got me in mid fall right? But seriously everyone had a good laugh and nothing could really break my spirit at that point. I accepted my awards with modest and dignity and gave a rousing speech as I prepared my class to go out into the world and be conquerors. And ya know what, I think they\u2019re going to do just that. I\u2019ve never been so proud to see all those faces looking back at me with hope gleaming in their eyes. And I\u2019ll never forget going out afterwards with my family and celebrating the night away. Some karaoke, a few drinks, and a couple anecdotes later and I felt it hit me. It was so emotional and real knowing it was all over to be honest. But I know that no matter where I go, my family and friends will always have my back like they did today."
