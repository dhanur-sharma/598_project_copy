        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 6 months ago I decided to give my girlfriend a promise ring. I had known that she loved my mother as much as I did and a few months before that, I had planned to take her to a special location that my mother loved. When we all first met each other, we had went to a park with my mother. The park was a secluded area that only my mother and her family knew about. It was lush and deer and other wildlife stayed around there. My girlfriend loved it there.  Anyway, after my mom passed my girlfriend wanted to go back one day and after she passed, I started planning going back. When I finally found the perfect ring, I knew that the park was going to be the place that I gave it to her at. Knowing that she loved it there, I told her that I was feeling sad about it, but wanted to go to the park. She was excited, but also knew how much this place would mean to me. When we left, we drove for hours to the park. When we got there, we sat on the bench and watched the birds and talked. The sun was starting to set and I knew it was the golden hour and that was the perfect time to give her the ring. Just when we were about to leave, I grabbed her hand and told her \"I have something I need to tell you.\" and I gave her the ring. She started crying and I spoke from my heart about how I feel about her and everything else. She was a gem and I love her and I always will. She was speechless about it! We have been together ever sense!"
