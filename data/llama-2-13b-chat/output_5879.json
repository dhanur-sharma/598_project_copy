I think part of that is because I was so focused on completing one task and then the next and then the next for the year building up to opening my business that it seemed sudden when the day actually came and it was a go. (Well, except for that last day. The 24 hours before launch were absolute hell. Too nauseous to eat. Too wound up to sleep. Certain, absolutely certain, that I had forgotten something critical and the whole damn thing would come collapsing down on me the next day.)But I did it. I jumped through all the hoops. I learned things I never even suspected I needed to know two years ago, and I made it. My company has been functioning for five months now, FIVE FUCKING MONTHS, and it's working! Last year this time, I wasn't even certain I was going to be able to get the damn thing started. The amount of knowledge that I had to learn and all the legal stuff (none of it written in actual English) were mind-numbing at times. I cried more than once just from exhaustion and feeling overwhelmed. But it's really working. I feel like I can do anything right now. Absolutely anything."
