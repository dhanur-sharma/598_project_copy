        "Summarize the following story in first person: Dear diary,6 months ago my dad was diagnosed with kidney failure. i was too scared to write about it at the time. talking out loud or writing down things like this make them seem more real, and i was kind of hiding away from the feelings i was having. thinking my father might die has been a horrible terrifying experience. i was in the waiting room with mom when he came out to tell us the results, and it is only one of a handful of times that i have seen my father cry. i cried too, way too many tears for way too long, but i didn't know how to react to the situation. I am finally writing this down because last week he got the news that he is going to be getting a new kidney. i am so relieved and i cannot even imagine the relief he feels. I feel like this is the first time i have been happy in months. i haven't minded taking him to the dialysis treatments or helping him out with any medication while this is going on, but thank god. every time we talked about it or scheduled an appointment it was a constant reminder of the threat to his life. i am honestly surprised that he was able to get lined up with a new kidney so fast. you hear on tv all the time how people wait years and end up dying on a waiting list. i am so thankful that this wasn't our experience. i don't even want to think about what it would have been like to watch my dad suffer like that. i feel so bad no for people that have to go through that. Don't get me wrong i am still worried about the surgery, with his medical problems, but this is so much better than living in uncertainty."
