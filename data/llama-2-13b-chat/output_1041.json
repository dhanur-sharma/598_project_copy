        "Summarize the following story in first person: Today my niece was born. It was a really surreal experience, especially when you see the little child herself. I have no children of my own, so it wasn't as impactful on me as it was my brother who is her father, but it still got me pretty emotional. When I held her I could only think about not dropping her, and also about the day it would be me handing my baby off to my brother. I am dating someone right now, so I could only think about the children we could possibly have. Would we be ready for parenthood? It was also a fun experience because a lot of family was there. We all talked about what was going on in our lives and each other's children, minus me, and what they're all up to. It was also kind of a scary moment. With all that is going on the world, it seems irresponsible to bring children into what is going on. One can only hope they will grow up unscathed by anything traumatic. These are just thoughts, because right now it is a joyous moment. Another family member has been brought into the family. It will interesting how she becomes related with everyone, her favorites and unfavorites. Only time will tell."
