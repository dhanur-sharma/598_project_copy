        "Summarize the following story in first person: My wife and I are in our sixties, fairly healthy, yet we are quite overweight.  We realized our obesity had reached a point where we were having difficulty even getting around anymore. I could barely tie my shoes: could not fold myself into a vehicle easily, and had gradually developed a pretty nasty case of sleep apnea. My wife was similarly affected, with the added complications of pre diabetes, and not being able to walk more than 100 yards without being winded. We had a choice: stand together, face up to our reality and fix it or be prepared to fade quietly into obesity purgatory. This truly was our last chance to recover, given our age and condition. I am here to report we are now cautiously optimistic. With a combination of intermittent fasting, low carb/high fat diet, restricted calories, and an initial rasher of phenetamine, we have lost  effectively 90 pounds for me, and 65 for my wife.  We can move again, apnea is disappearing almost entirely, .It is a day by day process, one small step at a time, and an unrelenting focus on the goal. The true secret is to be together, work it together, and support each other and focus on the small things. Just don't quit! There is nothing like a result, and having the patience to wait for it is a lost art. by taking it patiently, one can do amazing things. I have committed to my health as a life path, and do not think of it as a diet. life is  precious. You do not realize it until you see what you could lose."
