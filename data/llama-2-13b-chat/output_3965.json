I had made all the necessary preparations for it . However I somehow managed to misplace the bride's ring! I cant believe it. I felt like I put it down for a second to get me something to eat and it was like it went poof! I was freaking out so bad. but I couldnt let anyone know  about this mishap. I had to find it no matter what. My brother would have never forgave me if he knew this had happened. I then quickly traced all of my steps from decoarating the table to getting food. Thankfully I did manage to find that ring. It had fallen under the table with all the food on it. I was so relieved . After that the rest of the wedding went smooth. My brother or his wife never found out about the  moment I misplaced the ring. Everything was beautiful and i cried."
