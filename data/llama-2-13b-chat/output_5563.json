        "Summarize the following story in first person: Well, I do not know how to quite start this, but, the long and the short of it is I got stabbed. Earlier that evening I had suddenly gotten my tax return in my account. I immediately sent a good portion of the money to my mom as me and her had agreed. I immediately called my best friend and asked if she wanted to hang out. She said yes under the condition that I'd leave at 12am. So, I took an uber to her place in the city and we hung out. I was quite drunk when I left, ended up talking to a random guy who I end up going to 7/11 with. While inside, in line, a different person walks in, demands my wallet and stabs me three times in my breast, arm and side with a box cutter. I was taken to a local hospital, scanned, was crying, and then was told they needed to do exploratory surgery on my abdomen. Now a few interesting things happen when you find yourself the victim of a violent crime. Firstly, now I had to recover from surgery. From there, I had to have quite an intimidating interview with the police department in the city. Of course, despite the fact this happened on camera in a store in the richer part of the city they did not catch the guy. Now, I found myself having to deal with the psychological horror of yet another near death experience, and still dealing with it (as this happened roughly 6 months ago.) Finding a therapist has literally took me this long. But, I had to find a silver lining which is, now I can stay on therapy if I lose my insurance (I'm currently unemployed and am on medicaid) due to our state's victims compensation fund. Luckily, I have an amazing support system and I had a lot of different people reach out, but, it's still a long process."
