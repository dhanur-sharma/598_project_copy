        "Summarize the following story in first person: two months ago I was at party to celebrate my friend's first anniversary when I see my brother. I was very confused. My brother had been in Europe and I was not at all expecting him to be there. But, I was also very happy to see him. I also thought to myself...Why didn't I know he would be there? Why do we no longer communicate like we used to? What can I do to ensure this doesn't happen again? I really need to make sure our communication improves. It was fantastic to see him though. It seems as though he has been enjoying his time in Europe and he looked like he was doing well in his life. We caught up a little bit but, a wedding isn't really the best place to catch-up. So we were only able to catch up on the basic things. I am hoping that since he will be in the United States for a while longer that we can go out to lunch and properly catch up. The party itself was amazing. The couple really out did themselves with the food and decorations. It was definitely a good time."
