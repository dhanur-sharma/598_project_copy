        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was about 6 months ago, my birthday was coming up.  As it happens around each birthday, people start asking what you want for your birthday.  As we grow older, birthdays are just not a big deal any more, so my respond of course was, not to do anything.  Every time it is someones birthday we make sure to go out to dinner and drinks.  In my mind, my friends were planning a birthday dinner with my family and followed by some drinks afterwards.  This being the last year in my twenties, they decided to go a bit further.  My friends are good listeners and they discussed all my places i'd like to visit.  Little did i know they were planning a trip to Philly.  I was in utter surprise as we had never done something so big for each other.  I was completely surprised and beyond excited to be going with my best friends.  They blew me away going above and beyond to give me the best birthday i'd ever had.  Site seeing has to be the most memorable experience there as i love site seeing.  This has had to be the best gift since we have been trying to take a trip together for a while now and due to our schedule, it had not happened.  Other than site seeing, food is most definitely another one of my favorite things in life.  They didn't just make sure i went to one of the places on my list, we also got to enjoy the best philly sandwiches around."
