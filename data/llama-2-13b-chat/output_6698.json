        "Summarize the following story in first person: My recent break-upLess than a month ago my girlfriend Heather broke up with me. This was very difficult for me because we had been pretty serious about eachother (we had plans for a life together) and I wasn't expecting it at all. I had to move all of my things out of the place we had together, I remember thinking at the time that it didn't feel real to me, I couldn't get my emotions to process and as a result I felt disoriented. Even weeks after the event I still think about it from time to time. I have a lot of regret, could I have done something different? Could things have worked out if I had put in more effort? I'm learning that sometimes we can do everything right and things still not work out in our favor. That's part of being human. So now I'm trying my best to not dwell on my past and to look forward to my own personal future. This future will be devoid of other people determining my value or worth and I'll set my own goals for what I think is right. I used to worry about growing old and alone. Now I worry more about growing old and not achieving the things that I've always wanted for myself. I'll focus now on becoming more independent and stable. I no longer seek company from people who want more than just my presence. I think I can be happy again."
