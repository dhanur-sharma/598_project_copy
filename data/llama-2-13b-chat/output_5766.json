        "Summarize the following story in first person: We adopted our puppy about 4 months ago now. My husband and I were talking about getting a dog for the family. We have three children and they have been begging for a dog for a while now. We talked about it for a while, we did our research and found out what breed would be best for us. We ultimately decided on a golden retriever. This way the kids would grow up with a best friend, etc. I was looking at golden retriever puppies and I saw that the local animal shelter had a golden retriever. I was so excited to go check her otut. We went as a family to the animal shelter and asked for that specific dog. Unfortunately that dog was already taken and adopted out to a great home. We looked at the other dogs and we decided on a husky mix. She was a little under a year old and when we went to spend time with the dog she was so sweet and patient with the kids. She quickly won us over with her baby blue eyes. Her adoption fee was $150 but she came fixed, microchipped and all shots were current and up to date. She is now thriving in our home. The kids adore her and she is a great addition to our family."
