        "Summarize the following story in first person: Today, I received a call from an old friend at the best possible time. I had the absolute worst day of my life. My partner of five years admitted to cheating on me. Not once did she tell me about any problems with me or our relationship. Not once did she share any negative emotions. She always had a smile on her face and we did things together. To add insult to injury, I was transferred to a different unit at work even though I performed well and expressed a strong interest to finish my career in my unit. Evidently, the new boss wanted to clear out the veterans and make room for his friends. I guess I should have expected that considering his approach on projects he had been involved in--all consisted of old college buddies. And yet, despite these incredibly painful events, I was treated by the universe with a call from one of my most trustworthy friends from my childhood. It was as if the universe didn't want me to fall into depression. It was as if I was being reminded that there are always good and bad things that happen, but it was important to remember that they are all experiences we must go through. I had never been so happy in my life that day. I felt like that there's always hope if you wait for it. I'll never forget how awesome and supported I felt at the end of that day."
