I felt scared for a number of reasons. I tried to stay focused at all times. It was easier to think that, then to actually do it though. I am not sure if it is the car itself, the lights, or just my old eyes.  I felt like I could see as well as I should for the nighttime drive. What was amazing was the time. It felt like it was going backwards. It felt like it took 7 hours to get home when it only took 2. I think I might get a new car. Or perhaps not drive a night."
