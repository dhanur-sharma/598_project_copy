        "Summarize the following story in first person: My boss recently let me know that she had turned in her two week notice. By the time I found out she only had a week left to work because the partners at the firm wanted to keep it quiet. I was extremely shocked and sad when I found out. I had been working for her for almost six years. I was so shocked that I could barely listen during my CPE class I attended that day. My boss had become more than just a boss, she was my friend so I knew I would miss her a lot. She was also the person I went to with any questions so work is going to be harder now without her. I am not sure how my firm will survive, she was very smart and worked really hard. She kept us all running smoothly. Now that she is gone I have more work because everyone's work got shifted to take over what she used to do. I miss her a lot but I am happy for her. She deserves the best. I am now having to learn how to manage without her. She was always my go to person when I could not figure something out. ninspend a lot more time researching. I always took it for granted that she would be able to help me out. ni am learning to stand in my own to feet and make judgment calls now though."
