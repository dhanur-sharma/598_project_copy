        "Summarize the following story in first person: When I was a child, there was a hill that felt as if it were a straight drop. Of course, when you're young you do not read this as danger. Instead, you read this as excitement. All of the neighborhood kids would talk about 'bombing' the hill on your bike. Any kid who could do this would automatically gain bragging rights. And as a kid, bragging rights are the most valuable form of currency. It took little to no convincing before my cousins and I found ourselves atop of the hill, looking down towards the street below. What was the worst that could happen? I strapped my helmet on tight, and my cousins did the same. We had no knee pads. There was no protection from the asphalt other than our thin t shirts and shorts. Kids do not thin things through. Instead, they just act. The whole neighborhood gathered at the top of the hill. And with one deep breathe, we were off. At first the thrill was exciting- that feeling in your stomach when you drop on a roller coaster. But within seconds, we lost control of our bikes. The terrain was rougher than expected, and collided. My cousin writhed in pain from a broken wrist. My face was scrathed, my shoulder dislocated. Parents ran out of their homes. We spent the summer in casts- but we had the most bragging rights in the neighborhood."
