        "Summarize the following story in first person: Right about 6 months ago I and my brothers where planning on going to Ghana to host and event for my mom. This is the first time I and my brothers have decided to go all together for this special event for my mom. We have previously planed it a year before and it didn't work out. It didn't work out when we planted it the first time because my brother was hired in his new job and he couldn't make. So he told us to all wait the following year so we all can go together. In Ghana on April there is always a special event that occur so my brothers decided that we should host my mom birthday event at that same day. We discussed this event with a few family members so they can come help us celebrate. We all bought out tight and got ready to travel to Ghana. My two brothers landed in Ghana first and I landed last. When I arrive my brothers came to the airport with a few other cousins to pick me up at the airport. On our way home my brothers where talking about finding me a lady because I didn't have any woman in my life. A few days later my brother introduced me to this lady and I really didn't feel the connection much. Around that time it was getting closer to my mom's birthday celebration. I met a woman within a few days and she also didn't seem interested in me. All she seems to be interested was how much I will be spending on her. She didn't tell me but I can feel that is what she was about. So a few days later we hosted the event for my mother and everything went as planned. After my mom events I and my two brothers decided we are going to an Easter event. When we got there I saw a beautiful woman which I fell in love with by just looking at her. I tried to talk to her but she wouldn't give me some time to talk to her. I kept trying because she was the kind of woman I was looking for. So after a few tries of trying to get her number I offered her mine and left later on. So the next day she called and I told her that I would love to get to know more about her. She agreed and we started getting to know each other. I have and met her family and soon or later she will become my wife."
