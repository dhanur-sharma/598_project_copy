        "Summarize the following story in first person: My husband's family was having a family reunion last month and we made the trip to Idaho for it. There were over a hundred family members there, many that we had not seen for years. We had so much fun reminiscing about old times as well as catching up on what everybody is doing now. There were no uncomfortable silences or awkward moments. It really was just like being with old friends. How lucky are we to have family we consider friends?!It was our last day at the reunion and my husbands niece was not feeling well. She was pregnant and due to give birth any day. She assured everyone it was not contractions and she felt like she had just eaten something that did not sit well with her. Her husband is an ER doctor and was at work, so my husband and I offered to take her to get checked out. Imagine our surprise when her water broke on the car ride there and the contractions came on quick! My husband thought he was going to have to pull over to the side of the road while she gave birth, but we made it to the hospital in time. We got her in to the ER and her husband got there in time and we were actually still with her when she had her beautiful little girl. This brought back even more memories for me! It took my husband and I back to when our daughters were born. It was so special to be there and I felt like I relived the birth of my daughters. This experience took me back to 21 years ago, when I was admitted after my daughter was born because she came so quickly. I feel so lucky to have been there and to have witnessed such a beautiful and incredible moment. It was definitely the highlight of the reunion for me."
