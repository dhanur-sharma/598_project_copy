        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was my husbands 45th birthday, so I wanted to plan something special for him. So, I rented a helicopter, to take us to Phoenix for the night. My husband loves Phoenix, it is his hometown. I booked us a table at a beautiful restaurant that has an amazing rooftop bar. I thought he would so very excited and surprised! The day of his birthday I drove him to the heliport and told him my plan. He was absolutely shocked! The helicopter ride was about an hour long, and the scenery was amazing! We landed in Phoenix and it was sooooo hot! We walked around Phoenix for a while, but it was so hot, our shoes started to feel like they we're melting! We went to the restaurant for dinner, and sat out on the roof top bar. The floor of the bar was soooo hot! It made our shoes literally start to fall apart! We couldnt believe it was happening, it was so crazy! The bar was beautiful and the food was amazing though! We ate our dinner, and quickly left, with our shoes literally falling off our feet. We ended up stopping at Target and had to buy new shoes to wear home. Needless to say we we're totally shocked and confused by the experience, and it certainly ended up being a memorable birthday for my husband!"
