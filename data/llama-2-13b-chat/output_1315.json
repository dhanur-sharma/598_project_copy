        "Summarize the following story in first person: Dear diary, it's finally happened.  At the beginning of July my husband and I came to the decision to separate and divorce after a very lengthy discussion about where our relationship was going, or in this case was NOT going.  It was a very difficult decision for so many reasons.  I haven't been happy in so very long, a point I have made more than a few times within the last few years.  I tried desperately to express that I was unhappy to my husband and why I was unhappy in an attempt to fix our marriage, but it appeared my words fell on deaf ears.  I blamed myself for so long thinking that it was just me considering every time I tried to tell him why I was unhappy he never told me why he was unhappy, so I was led to believe I was the only one unhappy in the marriage.  It wasn't until our discussion that I found out that he was upset about something I was doing, or in that case was not doing, but the damage had long since been done.  I had given him more than a few opportunities to express his own feelings which he never took advantage of. This entire thing has been incredibly difficult on me to deal with considering we had just celebrated our 12th wedding anniversary, but I feel as though it is something I absolutely have to do in order for me to be happy.  I am absolutely exhausted, not to mention so very tired of being unhappy and being made to feel as though it were my fault, when it reality it was because he absolutely refused to communicate his own thoughts and feelings about what has been going on for more than a few years now. This entire thing has been in the making for quite some time, and it's only just recently that I finally felt that I had the strength and support of those close to me to do what I needed to do and end the marriage.  I have been torn for so long and debating about this decision for years now, but never had the courage to actually go through with it until recently. While it's sad that my marriage is failing, I am even more sad for the kids, of which we have two together.  They will have no idea what is going on, and the questions they have been asking me absolutely break my heart.  In the end we decided that the kids will continue to live with him which means that I will hardly get to see them.  It's incredibly stressful going through the motions of the divorce and to try and figure out custody of the children.  I'm still sad about what's going on, I'm hurt and heartbroken, but this was necessary for me and my well being."
