        "Summarize the following story in first person: About two months ago, my family and I went to the beach in California. There was a beach volleyball tournament that we wanted to see. We got up early in the day and were already at the beach around 10 am. We swam, sunbathed, and hung out while we waited for the tournament to start. The weather was perfect and it felt great that my family was together for the whole day. I got to catch up with my siblings since I had not seen them in a while. Then, the tournament started and we nervously and anxiously watched and cheered on our favorite team. The team ended up winning and we were so excited. Around 8pm we started packing up and walking home. When we got home, we realized we all got very badly sunburned. I guess in the excitement of it all, we forgot to reapply sunscreen throughout the day. We immediately went to the drugstore to get some aloe vera and pain killers. My brothers filled up the bathtub with a bunch of ice and soaked in it. We all got sunburned in the past, but never this badly. It was interesting to see how much we all helped each other. My brothers were wetting towels for everyone, and mom was making sure we were staying hydrated. I was in charge of the aloe and my dad was entertaining us to distract us. We had plans to go to dinner that night, we even made reservations. We all wanted to go so we started getting ready, but even the clothes were painful on our skin. Since we would all probably be cranky, we decided it is best to just cancel dinner and stay in. That day was so memorable to me because it started out as the best day I had in a long time, but then it ended with my whole family in excruciating pain. Despite everything this day brought us all together as a family and I am so happy it did."
