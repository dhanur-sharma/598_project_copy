        "Summarize the following story in first person: My son and his girlfriend decided that they could not stand living near me anymore. My son and I ended up arguing in the front lawn. Things were getting pretty heated and that is when he called me a name that no child should ever call their mother. I felt disrespected, humiliated, betrayed, and hurt. I had done everything that I could for this child. I gave birth to him, fed and clothed him. I never let him go without and then he turned around and did that. I didn't deserve that. I had done what I was supposed to as a mother. My job is to birth them, raise them, and make sure they live to see 18. He could have had a worse mother. It was like he didn't even appreciate any of it. I have four other kids and I knew I couldn't let them think that it was okay to disrespect me or my husband like that. So, I told him to leave and that I was done. I still love him, but I have to love him from a distance now."
