        "Summarize the following story in first person: My niece lives about 350 miles away so we do not get to see each other in person very often. Faith is the most important thing in my life, and family is a very close second. My niece is not spiritual at all, nor religious. She is a typical teenager who thinks she knows everything. When religion does come up, she tunes herself out of the conversation. She was visiting not long ago, and naturally religion came up in conversation. My wife and I were taking her school shopping, and she is actually the one who brought up something she thought was derogatory to women in the bible. That opened up the conversation because I was able to explain what the scripture actually meant. She was hesitant to listen at first, but I could tell that I had piqued her interest. She quickly changed the subject after my explanation because she didn't like the true meaning rather than the meaning she and her friends had chosen to believe because they took the scriptures out of context. That was okay though. She is a smart kid, and I know she is going to ponder on what I told her. I don't push religion on her at all because I know she puts those walls up. I love moments like this though because they are so few and far between. I am able to plant seeds that I know are going to be watered by the Lord, and that just thrills me to no end."
