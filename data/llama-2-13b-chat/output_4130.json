        "Summarize the following story in first person: I am thankful every day to be able to see  my children. I was very worried about them and how they would feel if I did not beat the odds and died. I lost my mother to cancer so I knew how hard it was. I wanted to live but was more worried about them then myself. My only grandson at the time was very close to me and still is. I don't think he would have done very well with loosing me. I am so grateful the my doctors and to my youngest daughter for everything they did for me. I lived me my youngest and she and I went through everything together. She still goes with me to all the doctors appointments and we both hold our breath every time. I still have a fear when I go for checkups. However, I would rather be aware of what is happening so I can make good choices and catch it as early as possible. I stay very aware of anything odd I feel. Any experience like this makes you very aware of everything in you body. You pay attention to the smallest things. I also don't randomly say I don't feel well. I don't want to worry my children."
