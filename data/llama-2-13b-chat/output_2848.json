        "Summarize the following story in first person: My sister and I were always really close. Her being the youngest, I always felt a sense of wanting to always be there for her. When we were younger, I would have to say, we didnt always get along. Her choice of men, the people she hung out with. All of it just seemed rather foreign to me since she was kind of the odd child out in the family. That's not to say I didnt love her or anything, but we always felt rather distant. After I graduated college, we kind of sorta fell further apart. She was five years younger than me, so although we were similar in age, the things we did and who we hung out with were pretty drastically different. Aside from family functions, I really never saw much of her after college. She focuses on school work and her friends, myself on my career. It wasn't intentional in any way, but it just didnt feel like we were as close as we should have been considering we were family. That's kind of why I was a little surprised when she called me up one day to talk. I knew that she had been seeing this guy for a while now through facebook and whatnot. I saw when he had proposed to her, although I still didnt really know much about her. She called to ask me to be her maid of honor. I was a little taken back since I had always felt so distant from her. The wedding itself was amazing. It was good to finally have the entire family back together for this wonderful day and it was great to see how happy she looked with her new husband. It was truly an amazing feeling to be up there with her on this day since I had never felt so close with her in my life. After that day, we actually started handing out more. Seeing mom and dad more often. The wedding itself brought our family back together and I finally feel like I have my sister back in my life like I had always wanted."
