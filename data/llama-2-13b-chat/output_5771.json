        "Summarize the following story in first person: A heart-wrenching time in my life began with my son going off to college. Sending a child off to college is difficult for any parent but this seemed harder. You see, my son has Asperger's syndrome. I had spent his entire life teaching him to function and live in a world that was not really made for him. My life with him was focused on protecting him and advocating for him. Now, I was about to send him off into and environment where I would not be. I had to trust that he was adult enough to handle these things on his own. My anxiety and worry began a few months before he even left. Daily I would imagine some horrible scenario he might face. I dreaded moving day. Inevitably, moving day arrived and we packed the car and drove to his new life. As I left him in that strange city on his own for the first time I was filled with sadness and worry. Day after day he persisted on. He rarely called each week even though I reached out daily. Each time I talked to him he confidently exclaimed to me that he was doing just fine and having a great time. He was living his life and doing it on his own. He was fine. I did my job and raised him to function and succeed in a world that was often difficult for him. When summer came, he decided to stay in the city to work and continue to live his independent life. He spread his wings and soared."
