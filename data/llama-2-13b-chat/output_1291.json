        "Summarize the following story in first person: A few months back I had to re-home my cat. My wife's allergies had gotten worse to the point that she couldn't breathe properly. my cat has been with me well over 15 years to this point. I looked around desperately, because I wanted to find her a good home, it was a stressful period of time. The cat has always been attached to me, so I did not want her to feel abandoned. Fortunately, my mother offered to take her in. At first, the boyfriend was not happy about it, and it is his house. Eventually, he warmed up to the idea however.  Now I visit her a few times a week, and she still has that familiarity of someone there. She has grown attached to the boyfriend. She also already remembers my mother, so that's a plus for her comfort. The most surprising aspect of the entire thing is the fact that it was a happy outcome for not only me, but my cat. Additionally, my wife is doing alot better with the allergies now. It's still a major transition for me, I was always used to my cat following me around, sleeping at the foot of the bed, and just our general daily routines. But the fact that i still get to see her, and help take care of her, makes thing's easier to deal with."
