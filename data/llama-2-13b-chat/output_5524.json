I was also going to open a bakery. This will be my first business. I am a little nervous. This business has a high failure rate. I hope I don't go under. I learned a lot of tips on how to have a successful business. The most important part is location. Another important tip is price and quality. I will make the best donuts this world has ever seen. I will also make some delicious bagels. I will have coffee that will rival the giants in the industry. I hope I will be successful in the world."
