        "Summarize the following story in first person: This event was the birth of my daughter. The most memorable part about this birth was how difficult and dangerous it was for my wife and daughter. My wife struggled very hard to push our daughter out. This was surprising and concerning because this is her sixth child so she obviously knows what she's doing. On top of this, it turned out the umbilical cord was wrapped around our daughters neck. So as my wife struggled to push the cord would constrict around our babies neck and her heart rate would plummit. This made everything very complicated and stressful. As time went on they prepped the operating room for an emergency C-section and told my wife she only had a couple more tries at natural birth. My wife had an emergency C-section on her first child many years ago so even this solution was dangerous. There was no real easy way forwards but my wife was determined not to have another C-section. something finally gave way and our baby started moving. They used a suction cup on her head to help the process along. Once everything started moving they still had to get the baby out far enough to remove the umbilical cord from her neck. There was a tense couple of pushes and I just remember feeling worried for them both. At last they got the umbilical cord removed and everything went smoothly from there.  It all worked out in the end but the process of the birth was very uncertain and stressful."
