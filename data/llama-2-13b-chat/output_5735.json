        "Summarize the following story in first person: A year ago I prayed for God to send help with saving and budgeting for my family. I was the helper of my household so things was hecked at times that I couldn't comprehend. So in this it was needful to find that help to help me relax from being overwhelmed.  I only had half knowledge of what that was and I felt as though I was burden with responsibility. So these past last six months my prayers was answered slowly but surely. The only thing i did was go to a store and ask a question. Not knowing the odds she would answer yes that she will help me. It may have taken weeks for a reply back form her. But when she called we didn't instantly connected the conversation was scattered at times. Then all of sudden she needed my help, that caused a door to be opened for me to gain guidance from her through couponing. She taught me how to shop and how to coupon within different stores. In my helping her she wasn't selfish in her giving and I was accomplishing more in saving then I even have. Also, the friendship we built was even better than ever. I was able get my head above water with her help and she gain a helpful friend. So i am thankful for God in so much ways that he answered my prayer just in time."
