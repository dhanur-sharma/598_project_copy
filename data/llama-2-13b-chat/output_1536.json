        "Summarize the following story in first person: I went home to Missouri, where I grew up, with my girlfriend of 2 years. She's California born and raised and is very much a valley girl. I was curious and, to be honest, a little amused at the thought of her adjusting to small town Missouri life. Especially because we are a lesbian couple and she's used to living in cosmopolitan Los Angeles where absolutely no one cares or notices a lesbian couple! I did tell her it's fine if we just pretend to be friends, but she was like no way, I love you and we're doing this. So we go home and of course my family doesn't care but we do get some stares. We stop and get gas in the middle of Nowheresville, Missouri and she asks me if I want something from inside the store and I'm like no, that's okay, but she's like are you sure baby? And squeezes my hand. That definitely brought some stares from the two other people at the gas station. When we're finally home, the house I grew up in, which is where my brother is having his wedding, her reaction to the food at dinner is hilarious. It's all fried and certainly not gluten free! But she is a trooper and so gracious so of course she ate it all and loved it because who DOESN'T like fried food. So then the day of the wedding dawns and the skies are so gray and I know it's going to rain, I just know it. I can FEEL the thunderstorm coming on. It's humid and the air is thick and my brother's now-wife had insisted on an outdoors wedding. Luckily we did have a lot of tents, so the rain did not get on us, but the wind did give us a light misting all over our nice clothes. I made a joke that we're all going to catch cold so this is the sickness & health part kicking in. But overall it was a wonderful wedding. My girlfriend and I danced to almost every song and it made me happy to see how far we've come as a society that no one judged us. Some people did make jokes about who wore the pants, etc, but I knew they were all in good fun. I also caught the flowers when my sister-in-law threw them at the bridesmaids! So...you know what that means!"
