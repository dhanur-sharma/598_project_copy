        "Summarize the following story in first person: Over the past month, I have come to know someone very significant in my life. I already consider this person a very close friend and lover. Our circumstances of how we met are unusual and not a coincidence. We believe it was meant to happen. Last week she took me to this park.. It's a beautiful park. She took me along a path and showed me a waterfall. We talked and had a nice conversation for a while. A Crane bird flew overhead and it was a nice moment. Then she showed me a calm river. While we were looking over the river, I thought about all the things we had experienced over the last month. I am a shy guy who lives in a small town and she has given me opportunities to express myself that I never had and to be able to see more of the world. I thought about how compatible we are to each other. I thought about how special she is and that I would help her along life's path whenever I could. Then while we were overlooking the river, she turned to me and closely looked into my eyes for a while. She has beautiful brown eyes. I'll never forget this moment."
