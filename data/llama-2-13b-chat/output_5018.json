        "Summarize the following story in first person: It's hard to believe all that's happened in the 4 months since James accused me of being abusive. My life is still in shambles, all from a lie. I'd heard stories about people who were wrongly accused, but I never thought I'd star in one. Even though he apologized in the end, the damage was done. Once word spread that I was an abuser, I lost my job and any sort of clout I had built up in my career field. Years of school, years of working under the thumb of my \"betters,\" all erased with a single utterance. I've spent the these last few months wallowing in my own self pity. Drinking, smoking, whatever I can do to keep my mind off the disaster known as my life. I can't even remember the last time I truly had a conversation with someone outside of saying thanks to a cashier. I have to change things, but the very idea of moving forward seems so impossibly out of reach. I spend my days secretly praying that someone or something will save me from this nightmare. James has come by a few times, but how can I ever let him back into my life? I keep him at a distance, I keep everyone at a distance these days. What's the point in trying to establish myself again when it can all crumble in the blink of an eye? I thought I was depressed before all this happened, but that was nothing compared to the pain I now feel on a daily basis. Soon I'll be out of money, and I don't know what I'll do then. I have no family to rely on, no real friends left who would help me on any sort of level above thoughts and prayers, I have nothing. I have to save myself, but I'm not sure I'm worth the effort."
