        "Summarize the following story in first person: My mom and I were traveling in Australia by ourselves. We were in our rental car and driving around the town of Brisbane. We got lost and were very confused as to which way to go because the sun was setting and we were tired from a long day of sightseeing. I was exceedingly nervous as the area we were in didn't look very safe that we had driven into. At the time, I was driving and my mom was navigating us using a map. I was getting more and more upset mostly from fear. My mom kept telling me to call down but I couldn't. She finally told me to pull the car over and we were in the process of trading places. As she got into the driver's side of the car, she actually drove off and left me there on the street corner before I could get in! I had left my phone in my purse inside the car as we were changing seats. I had no way to contact anyone and I was beyond freaking out. She wasn't gone that long, but if felt like a lifetime! She figured out where to go and came back and got me, but i was completely freaked out by that point. I can laugh about it now but then I thought I was going to die. I honestly wished she hadn't done that to me, but in her fear and anxiety of the situation she told me later that did what she thought was best in the moment."
