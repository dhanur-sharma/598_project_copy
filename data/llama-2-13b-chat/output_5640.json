        "Summarize the following story in first person: Towards the end of April, my mom and her fiance came to visit me and my husband from Pennsylvania the weekend after my birthday and she'd been asking me what I want to do. I'm a major homebody nowadays - what with having moved away from family, friends, civilization as I had always known it. I don't explore, I don't go out, I like comfy socks and TV shows. I live in the most rural area I've ever seen in my life after growing up in the suburbs of Philadelphia. Talk about culture shock. But anyway, the last time I'd visited Pennsylvania, she had talked about doing an Escape Room as a team building thing for work and I expressed how much I wanted to try one of those. So even though I didn't know what I wanted to do after my birthday, my mom found an Escape Room in a nearby city. She booked it and we went. So this being my first Escape Room, I had no idea what to expect. Mom sent me the list of the \"scenarios\" and said we should do an easier one since it was my first, but the one that struck my fancy was the one where I was supposed to be an FBI agent - the hardest one. I said, \"I hear what you're saying, but I want to be an FBI agent!\" So that's the one we did. And we did really well. At first there were so many different things that could be puzzle pieces that I was literally running from corner to corner wondering where to start. That took more time than it needed to, but once the first puzzle got solved it was pretty smooth sailing. We were in the room with three teenagers who seemed a little shy. Having worked retail, I tried to introduce myself and get their names because - you know, team building. It took a little while for them to really start engaging with us.  The whole thing went by in a blur and I honestly barely remember the entire process, I just know I had a great time and that we got the very, very last piece of the puzzle - a book with the code to unlock the door - when the clock was at 30 seconds. At this point, we weren't thinking as much as we should have been anymore and all but ignored the telling part of the clue that revealed the page of the book the code would be on. I was proud for almost getting out though, I think we definitely would have done if we didn't get frantic. Afterwards my husband told me that he loved seeing me like that. I had no idea what he was talking about. \"You were so amazing in there, you took charge of the situation and told people what you thought and I loved it.\" I didn't realize how naturally I'd fallen back into my Assistant Manager role where I knew what to do and how it needed to get done, but it felt really good. It was a much needed reminder that I have valuable problem solving skills and leadership skills that I can apply when given the opportunity."
