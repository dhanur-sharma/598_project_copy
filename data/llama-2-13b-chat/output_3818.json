        "Summarize the following story in first person: Today my first grandchild was born into the world.  It is a happy but also a sad day.  My grandchild is a girl and that is happy. She is healthy and that is happy.  However, her mother is what brings the sadness.  My son's girlfriend is a possible prostitute.  She is a known drug user.  She has no job and has tattoos all over her body.  She is twenty two years old and already has two children from previous relationships.  The youngest of which she does not even know for certain who the father is.  Another sad thing is that she has child protective services involved with the two boys and now this girl.  She got high and her two year old was out wandering the streets alone.  The police were called and found her passed out on the sofa.  Now, they are involved with this baby.  My granddaughter, son, and his girlfriend are having to move in with me and my husband.  We have to sign papers that we will watch the child and not allow her mother around her unsupervised.  Basically I now have to raise my grandchild as my own child."
