        "Summarize the following story in first person: Today is September 20th, and I had just gotten out of the hospital.  The past 10 days have been absolutely awful.  I was in the hospital and it absolutely sucked.  I was in a lot of pain, but it's slowly getting better.  I fell down the stairs and suffered a broken collarbone, some ribs were broken, and I had what was called a subdural hematoma.  As stupid as it may sound, I'm happy to be alive I suppose.  At least I was able to get to the hospital.  Now that I'm out of the hospital, it's a new journey I'll be going through.  I need to rest, and can't work much.  I can't really take care of myself doing the things I need to do because I need to let my bones heal.  I also have my family that are constantly required to check up on me at constant intervals because my brain was injured quite a bit in the fall.  I feel so helpless.  I feel like such a burden.  It's awful.  I wish I could just take care of myself and heal right away, but I'll need monitoring and help for the next while.  Hopefully my healing goes well and I can get over this, but until then, I'll need a lot of care."
