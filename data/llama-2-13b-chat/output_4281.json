        "Summarize the following story in first person: After standing in line, we went on the Harry Potter ride around 2 p.m. that Saturday.  The experience was truly epic!  We both relished the opportunity to experience the new ride.  I would recommend this ride to anyone who really likes Harry Potter movies and books.  In fact, I would offer that the uninitiated would enjoy the ride, too.  In other words, even if you are not a Harry Potter aficionado, you would likely enjoy this experience.  We have gone to all the Harry Potter movies and have every one of J.K. Rowling's books.  After enjoying the ride, we ate an early dinner and had spaghetti and pizza at the theme park's outdoor cafe.  While more expensive than usual fast casual restaurants, the spaghetti was delicious and complete with Italian meatballs spiced to perfection.  Compliments to the chef, indeed!!!  Despite paying the rather hefty $15 for parking, we were still enthused about the whole experience.  The theme park also has wonderful static displays, as well as video monitors, of the entire Harry Potter experience.  In fact, I heard via word-of-mouth that the theme park could have another Harry Potter ride in the future.  This would be a true delight for all people who like things related to Harry Porter and his cast of characters.  It is also rumored that Rowling may have another book lined up as well for her fans."
