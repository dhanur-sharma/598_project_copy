        "Summarize the following story in first person: When I got into a car crash and broke my hip, I had to go to the hospital for an extended stay. As expected, the unpaid hospital bills overwhelmed me. The sad thing is, this was after some of the costs were shouldered by my health insurance. I felt devastated that I would be bankrupt for an incident I wasn't responsible for. Why should  I suffer this when it was the the other driver swerved from his side and rammed into me? It just wasn't fair at all. About a week after the incident, I heard word from a co-worker of mine, who told me that he and the others at work began a donation drive, in person and online, to help pay for my hospital bills. Random people I  never met before donated money. It wasn't much for most; a couple dollars here and a couple dozen there, but when added up, they really made a mountain out of a molehill. The total donation amount was enough to cover most of my bills - I ended up paying a little over a thousand with my own money. This incident restored a large part of my faith in humanity. It showed that there are good people who would help you at your worst even when you can't do anything for them. Since then, I became a lot more positive about my outlook. I resolved myself to help others like others did for me. Even a small thing like a couple dollars might make that difference, because it was the case for me."
