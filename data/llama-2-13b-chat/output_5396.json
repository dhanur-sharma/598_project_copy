        "Summarize the following story in first person: I am not often surprised by the things people do to one another.  I've never been much of a \"Pollyanna\" and I'm not disappointed when I don't expect much from the behavior of others.  But I freely admit I was flabbergasted several months ago at the kindness of my friends and co-workers. I had looked forward to retirement, because I had purchased a small piece of property and there was a lot to do at my little farm.  I needed to build a carport so I could close in one wall and set up a work bench.  I needed to finish my greenhouse, and I needed to prep my garden by turning the planting beds.   But I got sick and was under the weather for several months.  I don't normally let things get me down, but because I felt rotten, I began to fret about the work not being finished.  I was texting back and forth with a friend and mentioned my state of mind. My farm sits on a small hill.  I was curious  a few days later when, sitting on the front steps with my coffee, I looked down the way and saw a caravan of cars and pickups  coming in my direction.  I was completely flummoxed and moved to tears when they pulled into my drive and snaked up its length to park in rows and began unloading building supplies, barbeque grills and coolers.  Over the course of time my friends and co-workers built a carport, finished my greenhouse and completely tilled and mulched my garden beds.  I wasn't even allowed to work on the barbeque! I did not know I had such kind friends.  I didn't think such thoughtfulness and generosity existed.  I do know that later, when the garden began to produce, I began to think of ways to repay that kindness.  My friends and former co-workers will have more green beans and zucchini than they'll know what to do with this year!"
