        "Summarize the following story in first person: Six weeks ago, I attended my son's middle school graduation ceremony. I was very proud of my son. I has grown up a lot since he was a baby. There was a slideshow of all the kids from the past eight years of school life. I saw the little squirt sliding down the slide in kindergarten. I saw him get his first A in the first grade on a big math test. I saw him get into a fight in second grade over a girl. In third grade, I saw him make a fun science experiment. It was a volcano. This was very impressive and I was proud. After the slideshow, there was a pizza party. Everybody was excited and I had a lot of slices. Everybody was full from the pizza. There was some soda and I drank some. I went home after the ceremony feeling proud."
