        "Summarize the following story in first person: My brother was the victim of a random act of violence and was murdered almost eight months ago now. He was the smartest and most talented person I have ever known. I have never seen anyone match his ability to learn how to do something and to quickly master that same skill. He is a huge part of the person I am today and I do not know who I am without him.  It has been incredibly hard to accept that he is gone and I still sometimes wake up in the morning and expect to hear him waking up because he heard my alarm go off and would be trying to beat me to the bathroom. He was always competitive with everything especially when it comes to me. On the night that he died he was stabbed by a man who answered the door at a house where my brother was going to hang out with his friend. It was his first time being to this house and it turns out that he was at the wrong house and was knocking on the wrong door. This mistake cost him his life because the man who answered the door thought he was somebody else because he was drunk and high on drugs as well. The man attempted to confront my brother who did not take being pushed around by this random man who was not in his right mind.  The man pulled out a knife and stabbed my brother in the heart as he backed away with his hands raised up. This man who had no idea had just mortally wounded someone he did not even know. A neighbor called an ambulance, but he bled out on the way to the hospital. The man was arrested and is awaiting trial. This is the story of the end of my brother's life."
