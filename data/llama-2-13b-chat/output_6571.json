        "Summarize the following story in first person: I drank a little too much at the bar one night and I met these two girls at the bar. I am what you might say a usual at this bar. I tend to go there often after work. This particular night these two girls were very chatty and I started to drink with them. I don't remember much but what I do remember is waking up in the morning next to the large friend. I was hoping I would be taking the prettier one to my place but that was not the case. I think I was drinking gin, but I forget, the night was a blur. Anyway I woke up next to the girl and I felt an instant regret rush through me. I didn't even know their name. But that didn't matter and so I asked this person to leave and that was that. After she left, I laughed for a couple of minutes then I cooked the largest omelette to fill up the dark hole of regret inside me. Then I started my day. A couple of days after that I told a couple of my coworkers and it was a funny story that I told for about a week and that was that. The funny thing is I saw that same girl in the bar a week or two ago. I didn't talk to her but we both smiled at each other in acknowledgement."
