        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 4 weeks ago, my friend Janika, who I thought I was estranged from, reached out to me to tell me she was worried about friend Shy because Shy had not been answering any of her phone calls. I dropped what I was doing, which was finishing up some important work documents, and I helped out. First, I tried calling Shy to see if she would pick up. She did not. Then, I checked all of Shy's social media accounts to find out if she had any recent activity. She did not have any, so I decided it was best to drive to her house and physically check on her to make sure nothing happened. I got in my car, and drove to her house, which was several hours away. When I arrived, I used my spare key I had to her home and went inside. I was surprised to see Shy sitting on the couch watching a movie. I told her Janika had been calling her and looking for her and so had I but neither one of us could get ahold of her. Shy then told me that her screen on her phone was broken so she didn't get any calls and hasn't been on social media. I called Janika on facetime to show her Shy and Janika was very happy and super thankful that I was ale to help out. I was proud of myself that I went to go check on her as well because you never what can happen to somebody and it's important to check on your friends because they may be in need and not want to reach out. I would have also been devastated if something had happened to Shy and I never got up to check on her, I would feel slightly responsible.  Ultimately I felt trusted and close with them. I was happy that I decided to drop everything and help because I was able to verify that my friend Shy was doing alright and I had made contact with Janika, who I had thought I was estranged from."
