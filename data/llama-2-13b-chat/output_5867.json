        "Summarize the following story in first person: Today was such a big day: I dropped my baby girl off at Bolshoi and left her there. I can't believe this all actually happened. It feels so surreal. I know that she will be so successful; she will grow and learn so much, but a part of me still worries. Will she be homesick? What if she gets injured? Or sick? How quickly can I get to Connecticut from Chicago in an emergency and limited income. Thank god for Facetime. My favorite part of drop-off was either making up her bed (her roommate also had a purple color scheme!) and unpacking her or meeting all of the program staff. She has a corner room in a building from the mid 1800s and NO air conditioning. I am so glad we brought those fans. I love that she's in such a beautiful setting, but man it is going to be hot in there! I am so proud of my myself that I managed to not shed one single tear when I said my goodbyes. I knew if I cried, she might cry, and I had to be strong for her. She is on the first adventure of her life, on her own, and she isn't even 12 yet. Only six weeks to go! I know I can do this. And watching her in the final performance and seeing her growth will make it all worth it!"
