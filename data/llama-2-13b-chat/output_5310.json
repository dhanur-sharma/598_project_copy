        "Summarize the following story in first person: Two weeks ago I went to my kids school for ice cream day. It was beautiful and sunny outside, so everyone got to have their ice cream on the playground. My kids and I all got strawberry because that's our favorite. I love that I got to spend extra time with my kids and share that special memory with them. Ice cream is always good, it's even better when you have someone you love to share it with. The kids were all so excited and I loved just sitting and watching them run around with smiles on their faces, enjoying a break from their school routine and a refreshing scoop of ice cream as well. My kids and I say under the shade of a tree for almost an hour talking and reading a book together while we ate. We laughed together and talked about what we would do the following weekend. It was very relaxing. Some of the other kids ran around the playground and went on the swings and slides. They all had a great time. Once thing that shocked me was how clean all the kids were by the end of the outing. I was expecting sticky hands and faces and lots of ice cream stained shirts. I even brought wet naps, just in case, but they were all clean as a whistle. The greatest part of the ice cream day was that we raised enough money to fix the ceiling in the school library! I was shocked. I thought it would help us towards our goal, but I never thought we'd actually raise all of it. It was a day I will never forget!"
