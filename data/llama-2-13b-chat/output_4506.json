        "Summarize the following story in first person: I've been 35 for 4 months now and it doesn't feel too bad.  You know what they say, \"35 is the new 25\" !  I'm still recovering from my big Las Vegas birthday weekend, so maybe that saying isn't true.  Anyway, we had so much fun.  We got it in and partied hard.  I realized that I was getting older and wanted to make up for lost time.  I wasn't much of a partier when I was younger, too shy and introverted.  Severe social anxiety kept me cut off from life.  Plus, I come from a highly dysfunctional family and was burdened with huge responsibilities from a early age.    Once I got into my thirties I decided that enough was enough.  You only get one life to live so you might as well live it.  Back to the celebration!  I've never been to Las Vegas before, never even been on a plane, it was huge and overwhelming but in a good way.   Very hot too.  I just wanted to stay in my air conditioned room or lounge by the infinity pool but my friends dragged me up and down the Strip.  We went from casino to casino, buffet to buffet, indulging almost all of the seven deadly sins.  Marie tried to take us to a strip club, but they were too full.  Oh well.  I won about $500 but spent it getting us bottle service at the dance club.  I almost felt kind of foolish being my age, like the old auntie in the club trying to keep up with the young ones.  I had much more fun eating my way through the elaborate buffets and shopping at the fancy stores.  I bought some cute clothes but I can't fit them.   I think I gained 10 lbs that weekend and I'm still trying to work it off.  My friends liked the casinos the best, especially since I gave them the money to gamble!  Overall, I had a good time and I can say that I did something fun in life.  Hopefully, I can have more fun in the future and not just on my birthday."
