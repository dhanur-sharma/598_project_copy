        "Summarize the following story in first person: So the toilet was clogged. I called my husband to let him know what was going on. He said that he would take care of it when he got home. He worked on it and put some powered sepic safe unclogger in it and let it sit. He called his mother to let her know what was going on , that he put unclogger in the toilet. She then decided to stop at home depot to pick up something else. She bought draino , which is NOT toilet safe , and should not be mixed with ANYTHING else.  Well she came home and dumped an entire bottle of draino in the toilet and created a toxic gas , basically mustard gas according to poison control. Decided to go smoke a cigarette while the entire house filled with the chemical fumes. I ended up taking them both to the ER for breathing issues. My mother in law tried to kill her and my husband by mixing chemicals and not reading warning labels.  She brushes the incident off as nothing serious but it was.  So please read the warning labels on chemicals.  Do not use draino on a toilet.  BE safe and think about when you are doing first."
