        "Summarize the following story in first person: Seeing the Who with my father was a highly emotional experience and one of the greatest birthday gifts I've ever received. The Who are his favorite band of all time, and we have always communicated best through discussing our mutual love of music. Since my mother passed away two years ago, we talk almost every day. So when he said he wanted to fly me to Miami to see the Who, I was startled and excited. They weren't playing here in Phoenix, but I had always wanted to see them. Plane tickets aren't cheap, and let's just say that he got us such good seats that the tickets were more expensive than the flight! My mother had been a fan of the Who, as well, but she and I only attended one concert together. That had not been a good time, because I really hate Jimmy Buffett, and she was disappointed in his performance. We had always talked about going to see the Who or Bob Seger as a family, but it never happened. So, in a way, not only was I getting to bond with my father, but I also managed to find a way to honor plans my late mother and I had made. Watching the show was fine. They put on a great show. But, more importantly, my father and I had the fun of attending a concert together and sharing a special moment.  He got to share his most beloved band and I got to see the glow on his face. That meant the world to me."
