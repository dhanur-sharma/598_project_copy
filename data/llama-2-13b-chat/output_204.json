        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was so upset by my landlady! Six weeks ago I went to go to my job. I have a job that requires me to be there 5 days a week. I headed out to my car as always in the early morning. Much to my surprise my car was not there! Can you imagine how my heart sank? I had no idea what happened to my car. Worse of all I had no way to get to my job on time. I came to find out that my landlady did not approve of the way I parked in the lot. Since this upset her she decided to have my car towed! Instead of calling me first she just made a knee jerk decision and called to have my car towed. I had to incur the expenses of the impound yard. To recover these costs I have decided to sue my landlady. There was no reason for her to go to that extreme and I am certain I will recover the costs. I am not someone who is sue happy but since she won't reimburse me I have no other choice. This could have all been avoided had she just kindly called me. We all have our assigned parking spaces and she knew the car was mine."
