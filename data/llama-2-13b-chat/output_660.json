        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was recently confronted with someone who had a gun where I work. I'm a nurse at a plasma donation center and one of our donors pulled his needle out of his arm and ran to the back storage area. A phlebotomist had safely bandaged his arm and put him in our biohazard room. After she left the room, I went in to assist and calm him down. He was on the phone with the police requesting assistance because he thought he saw someone in the parking lot that wanted to kill him. I assured him that he was in a locked room, safe and I would remain with him until the police arrived. Next thing I know, he pulls a gun out of his pocket. I slowly back away from him and move a large biohazard garbage bin (on wheels) between him and I. I move slowly to the door and reach for the handle. He points the gun at me and yells not to open the door. I assure him that I'm not going to open the door, I was just holding the handle so no one else opened it. I asked him to please let me leave. He reiterated \"don't open the door\". I remained calm and tried to keep him calm as well as he remained on the phone with the police. Once more, I stated \"please let me leave. I want to go on the other side of the door and guard it for you\". At this point, he pointed the gun at the ground and told me to leave."
