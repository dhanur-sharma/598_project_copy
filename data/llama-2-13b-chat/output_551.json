        "Summarize the following story in first person: I recall recently when my two cousins came for a visit to the USA from the UK. Being they live so far away we do not see them often. They are in there younger twenties and busy with their own lives. They came to stay with my step mom for a visit since my Dad passed away in January. They came to keep her company and help her with the farm. While they were here we got to see them quite a bit. My two boys are young and they really enjoyed having some new people to play with. While they were here we planned a trip to Indianapolis to go to the Children's museum and the Zoo.  It was a nice trip, we all rode down in my mom's car with my two cousins, my nephew and my two boys. We went to check into the hotel and then headed off to the children's museum for the day. After the museum we went back to the hotel where we went swimming before dinner. We found a nice restaurant with good ratings right next door, it was perfect so we just walked over and had a very nice dinner. The next day we got up early and after continental breakfast we went to the zoo for the day. After the zoo we drove back home. It was so nice to do something that everyone enjoyed and will always remember."
