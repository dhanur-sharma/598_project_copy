        "Summarize the following story in first person: My cousin told me my mom is coming to town next week. She asked me was I going to let her see the kids. Of course when i said no I was made out to be the bad guy again.  Everybody keeps saying she changed I should not hold my childhood against her. But shouldn't I? When I was finally ready to give her a chance that went all the way left. I asked her how did I get burned why do i have what looks like cigarette marks on my body ? And her response was God has already forgiven me for what I have done. I remember being so taken a back by what she said I didn't even know how to answer. How could she deny me the information because God forgave her. I wanted to scream What about me the person who all this crap happened too? But I didn't I just didn't say anything. Its easy for people to say you should forgive when they are not the ones who have been wrong. I have children of my own and I know sometimes parenting is Hard. But I have never wanted to hurt my kids. And when i make a mistake I come back and i say im sorry. Why couldnt she have least done that? So no she will never be in my life and that includes my kids life and m fine with that,"
