        "Summarize the following story in first person: Two weeks before I was born, I had an uncle that past away in a car accident.  He choose to get into a car with a friend driving, and not wear a seat belt.  They were both intoxicated.  My whole life I have heard so many wonderful stories about him and how full of life he was.  About a month ago, while scrolling through an old Facebook post that a family member had posted a picture marking that my uncle would have been 60 years old.  I saw where another family member of mine who just recently passed due to years of substance abuse, had commented.  She wrote that she was there at the bar that night, and realized that as he was leaving she should have stopped him, but didn't.  I have such horrible feelings about seeing this post.  Since she is also dead, there is no way for me to confront her and find some sort of resolution.   How could she have let he just walk out knowing what state he was in?  I have been left now after finding this information out, in such a state of turmoil.  I'm not sure how to reconcile my feelings.  I have always felt cheated in life that I never got to know him, and this comment that I discovered on Facebook makes it so much worse.  I realize that he made his own choices, and that they were not good ones.  I just wish my cousin had one moment in her life where she wasn't a complete waste and speak up for him and possibly keep him safe.  I hate her.  I never really liked her much because of how her drug/alcohol abuse made her act, but now I harbor such contempt with no way to confront her.  It's one of those things everyone tells you to give to God.  I'm trying."
