        "Summarize the following story in first person: My mother had a heart attack before her surgery for removal of her ovary and fallopian tube. She had cancerous cells found in her ovary and it was a relatively simple and minor surgery. They had taken her back for her pre-op checks and everything seemed to be fine. They started her on anesthesia and that's when her heart stopped. They got her heart started again and the doctor came out to speak with me. He said it happens sometimes with patients and that they were going to postpone the surgery to do more tests and see how she does. They ran tests and it seemed to be a fluke that it happened since everything came back normal and healthy. A week later she had the surgery without any complications. When the doctor told me what happened, the world just stopped and I felt like everything was in slow motion. Until he said that she was alive and fine, I ran through all of the things that I would have to do as well as try to comprehend the loss of my best friend and mother. I had a panic attack set in and started crying and shaking. It took me about 30 minutes to be able to get my body under control and to get my emotions under control to go and see my mother. I didn't want her to see me upset because that would upset her more than she already was.  I love my mother more than anything in the world and she's my best friend. It was one of the scariest moments of my life and I hope that I don't have to go through that for a very long time."
