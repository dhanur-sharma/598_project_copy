        "Summarize the following story in first person: An event I remember recently is a family reunion my family had in June. It was awesome because I got to see family members I haven't seen in years. I was responsible for helping set up the food and drinks at the event. Also since I was an older cousin I had to help set up events for the younger children. It was a 3 day event with different events everyday. Overall I loved the experience and can't wait until I get to do it again in a few years. My family from out of town came in. I had family staying at my house. And I had other members of my family staying at hotels. I have a pretty big family so there were a lot of people. The reunion was for the family on my mothers side. She had 8 brothers and sisters. So all of them and there kids came. Which made the reunion really big. We usually do a reunion every 2-3 years. The last time was in the Caribbeans. And this time it was in my hometown where I live."
