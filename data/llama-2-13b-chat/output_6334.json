        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was driving one night, and I was pulled over by the police. The police had me breathe into a breathalyzer. I was disappointed that I was above the legal limit.  I shouldn't have been drinking, but I felt I didn't drink enough to be above the legal limit. As a result, I was detained and put in jail for a night. I was sad, mad, depressed, and disappointed. I now have a DUI on my record for life. After a few hours, I realized how fortunate I was. If I hadn't been caught, this behavior was likely to escalate. If it did escalate, I would have been well above the legal limit in the future. Moreover, I could have killed someone tonight with my irresponsible behavior. Therefore, I am thankful that the outcome was not worse. I was released from jail the following morning, with a new lease on life. However, when I came home, my parents were disappointed in me. Instead of talking to me, they put me down. They told me I was nothing, and that I couldn't drive a car because I would amount to nothing. How disappointing. My optimism toward life has turned into pessimism."
