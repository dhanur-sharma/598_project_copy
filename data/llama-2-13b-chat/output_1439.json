        "Summarize the following story in first person: 3 months ago, I got dismissed from my nursing program. I started to experience emotions of anger and frustration. I had failed my practical exam 3 times. I know the rules clearly said that if you fail three times, you get dismissed. This has not stopped me from feeling anger toward my instructor. I know that woman had it in for me from the beginning. She was always picking on me. Always saying condescending things toward me. When I got good grades, she always joked that I had copied someone. I was doing okay on all the subjects she didn\u2019t teach me. I blame myself for not doing anything and not talking to the dean the second time she made me fail. On my last practical test, I went to take the test soon after I had been involved in an accident. An old woman who could barely walk rear ended me when I was getting out of the parking lot. Should people this old even be allowed to drive? When I got to the testing center late, that evil woman refused to even listen to me. She completely ignored me when I asked if I could be tested on another day. I talked to the dean and had all the evidence with me but he refused to take my side. It was no surprise he sided with her. I will probably hire a lawyer and sue the school. The anger I feel is indescribable."
