        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 2 months ago me and some friends took a road trip down to Colorado to take part in the legal weed. We purchased their best plants and then headed out to enjoy the rest of the nature and scenery as well as a few other fun activities. We decided to do a bit of hiking in some near by woods, set down on a homemade blanket my mom made me when I was 12 and enjoyed our surroundings whilst lighting up a blaze. I laid back to admire the tall tress reaching for the heavens, I closed my eyes to listen to the wind blowing through the leaves. I could hear the others laughing and talking among themselves and I smiled, I smiled because they were smiling. I stretched out my arms, stretched them out as wide as I could, as if I was trying to each either side of the woods. I dug my fingers into the soil, as the soil dug back deep underneath my finger nails. After passing our rolled plant around a bit, a few puffs later we decided to head down to a local ranch to do a bit of horseback riding but first we stopped by a casino because someone wanted to hit the slots. I'm not much for throwing my coins down the toilet so I just watched the others and after just a bit we left. When we finally got to the ranch my head was a bit funny, I had the giggles and the horses were absolutely stunning. We went into the barn to pick out the horses we wanted and I picked out the one that I felt was my spirit animal, her name was June and she was magnificent. We all got saddled up and started along a path, the sun was shinning, the whether was perfect and I had this powerful beast between my legs, it was turning out to be the perfect day, until I slipped off and nearly busted my ass; turns out I got so wrapped up in the moment that I forgot to hold on to the reins. After falling off the horse, I was a little shook but I barely felt a thing, thanks to the legal plants we part took earlier that day. We headed to a local dinner after the ranch, being that we were all starving and/or had the munchies; I ordered something greasy and unhealthy, like the rest; I promise to hit the gym sometime next Tuesday. After a long day we all headed back, I fell asleep in the back of the car, my head resting of the shoulder of my BFF and my wannabe lover, with the light summer breeze on my skin, and a smile permanently print on my soul...This was definitely a day I will always remember."
