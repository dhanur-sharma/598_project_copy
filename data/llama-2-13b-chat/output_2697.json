        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 3 months ago I experienced one of the most life changing and memorable events of my life. I went and traveled to Japan and I lived there for three months with a Japan family. It was something I had been looking forward to my whole life because I have always had a great interest in Japanese culture. When I finally arrived in Tokyo for the first time, it felt as if I was in another planet. Everything was completely different. The people looked different, they spoke a different language , the architecture was completely different.  It was like a different world. I was so excited and I felt more alive than I ever had before. I was picked up at the airport by the family I was staying with and while I was very nervous at first I eventually got more confidence in myself when talking to them. They were very kind, friendly and they treated me like a family member. When I arrived at their house, it was more tiny than I expected, but I really loved the feel of it. It had a lot of Japanese traditional rooms including a tatami room which I really loved. The family took me around Japan to a lot of different cities and towns including Kyoto, Tokyo, Saitama, and we even flew to Okinawa as well. I really admire how clean the cities are in Japan and how polite people are. They are very friendly and helpful to foreigners. I loved every minute of this trip and it was such an incredible experience for me. I grew so much as a person and I got to see some of the most beautiful places on earth. I also made friends for life, I know have friends on the other side of the world and we message each other all the time.  This was by far the most memorable experience of my life. I can't wait to go back again in the future."
