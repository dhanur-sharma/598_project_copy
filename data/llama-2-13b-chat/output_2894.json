        "Summarize the following story in first person: One of my most recent memorable moments would have to be the birth of my son. I can remember this moment pretty well. It was a long tough pregnancy and I was excited for my son to arrive. I had always wanted a son, I had done lots of prepping for the arrival of a new baby. I had received lots of gifts from many family members who were also excited. I remember the anxiety I felt as his arrival neared. We arrived at the hospital early in the morning while most people were still asleep. There was lots of waiting around and I was extremely tired. Finally my son arrived that morning and it was a life changing moment. I got to see him, hear him, and hold him which was just as amazing as I had imagined. He was so tiny and handsome. It was surprising to see how much he resembled me. Watching my family become complete is priceless. That was a moment I will always cherish. The long wait was definitely worth it."
