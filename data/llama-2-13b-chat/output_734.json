        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was Thursday the 11th of July 2019. My annual results were to be declared on that day. The morning smiled at me brightly when I learnt that I had topped the list of successful candidates in my class. I felt simply overjoyed. My parents and other people at home were jubilant and there was a celebration in my honor. I received a bicycle as a gift from my father. At around 12. 30 p.m. there was a call for me. Thought it to be one of the congratulatory calls, I casually went to receive it. I almost screamed with merriment, when I heard an old friend Williams speaking to me! I had lost connection with him about two years ago due to a misunderstanding between us. He wanted to come and meet me. I felt very excited when ultimately we met. We felt like the same old pals! Finally, this eventfully glorious day ended and we were in sound sleep. At the end of midnight, I heard a knock at the door. To my utter joy and surprise, I saw my younger brother, who had been missing for six months, standing in front of me! What could be a greater moment than this? We all went mad with joy. I saw tears in everyone\u2019s eyes in my family. These were the tears of extreme happiness."
