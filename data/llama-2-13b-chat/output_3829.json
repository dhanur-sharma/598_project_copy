        "Summarize the following story in first person: It's a bit of a weird thing, but I have a brother from my dad's previous marriage. I never knew him, never knew anything about him, and just never had a chance to know him. This isn't a good feeling. It felt as though I was robbed, by my own father. He never once mentioned that he had a son, let alone a son that was older than I was. I always thought that I was the oldest son. My father probably never intended to hurt me this way, but I can't help but feel so angry at him. My brother and I have so much in common. We have similar hobbies, like the same foods, and even watch the same television shows. I have made an effort to hang out with my brother at least once a week. It can be difficult, since we both work. We try to get together once a week to watch a certain show we like, and sometimes we even will order a pizza because we like the same toppings. I love my brother so much, and I feel so much anger towards my dad. I don't know if I can even forgive him. I am now looking into getting therapy for this."
