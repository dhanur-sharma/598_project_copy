        "Summarize the following story in first person: The end of August marked my parents' fiftieth wedding anniversary.  And fifty years ago, a lot happened that summer.  My parents aren't much for big celebrations.  However, there was much discussion around how everyone was going to get together.  My dad spends a lot of time in the northern part of the state.  Was everyone going to head up there?  Were we going to meet somewhere in the middle?  Dad finally decided to come down, but he didn't want a lot of fuss made or anyone to put themselves out, so he only told my mom and me.  I think part of it was wanting to be a surprise and part of it was not wanting people to be disappointed if he couldn't make it down.  He did finally make it down towards the end of dinner, though he had to call and get directed to my sister's house as it had been awhile since he had been there.  He brought everyone something rather than the other way around, something that was supposed to have been done last Christmas, but oh well.  It was a good time, laughing and talking with almost everyone there (my older sister couldn't make it).  My parents reminisced about fifty years ago.  My mom's brother also got married that year and I don't remember ever learning that, though I might have.  It was good to see my dad and both mom and dad seemed to enjoy themselves.  It was basically just a family dinner, but it meant a little more."
