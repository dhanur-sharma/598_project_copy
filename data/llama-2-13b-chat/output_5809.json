        "Summarize the following story in first person: So now it's been over 4 months and I still haven't talked to her. I have talked to my son though and some weeks ago he said \"You and Mom shouldn't live together\". He also told me she had fallen and broken her wrist. Unfortunate, but she really needs to find the underlying cause of why she keeps falling. She does it on a regular basis, only this time she broke something. But, it's not my place to take care of her anymore.     So I'm moving on. I found a really cool place to live in the foothills of N.C. I'm house sitting for an owner who works in Virginia and comes home 2 weekends a month. I look after the house and also 2 dogs. All the benefits of owning a nice house without having to pay a mortgage or a lot of bills. I expect to be here until early Summer when I will return to my Summer job not far from here.  I am kind of lonely at times but I think being lonely is better that living in the stress of a bad relationship. I'm reflecting on things I could have done, should have done. But more importantly looking towards the future for the first time in a long time."
