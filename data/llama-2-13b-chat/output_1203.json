        "Summarize the following story in first person: I decided to quit my job a few months ago. It was a completely impulse and random decision, but it turned out to be one of the best decisions that I have ever made. I was already having creeping suspicions about the job and a voice in the back of my head was telling me to just quit and never look back. At first, I didn't want to listen to it, but as time passed the voice started to grow louder and louder. I started to notice things that I seemed to have been to naive to notice at first. Mainly though, my mental health was in a very terrible place and working at this job did nothing but seem to make it worse for me. On top of that, I was not being compensated properly and I discovered I was having money constantly stolen from me. So one day I went in to collect my paycheck and I was getting excuses as to why it wasn't there. As I was walking out, I just kind of decided \"fuck it\" and I never returned. At first, I slightly regretted the decision. Not because I believed it was the wrong decision or anything, but because it was such an impulse decision and I didn't really have a back up plan at the time. Looking back, I am extremely happy I made that decision. Financially speaking, it was very dumb. But I can honestly say that I started to feel loads better mentally after I quit. That's what really matters right?"
