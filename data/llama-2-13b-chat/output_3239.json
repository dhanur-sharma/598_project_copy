        "Summarize the following story in first person: Ah yeah.  I was getting ready to go to work one morning.  It was the usual deal, making breakfast and the lot.  I get a call from a buddy of mine, \"Hey, man, I need your help.\"  We've been friends for an age and so I was fine with it.  I figured he needed some input on something.  No bid deal.  \"Sure man, what's up.\"   \"There's a bear in the house.\"   Now this I wasn't expecting.  \"By bear...  Do you mean like, an old gay guy, or you mean, like, Yogi Bear?\"   There was silence for a second and then, \"Dude, why would I be calling you about an old gay guy in my house?   I mean a bear, bear.\"   I knew I needed to get to work, and that if I was late, then the boss might be pissed, but okay, I'm game.  \"Alright, I'll be right over.\"  So I drive over to his place and walk in.  His wife is in the house being all emotional.  I tell her, \"Don't call the cops, all they will do is shoot it.\"  \"Where is your better half at?\"   \"He's downstairs.\"   I walk to the basement steps.  \"So bear?\"   He points.  Sure enough, there is a black bear, maybe the size of a medium sized dog curled up on either a laundry pile or a few old blankets.  \"Alright, we can call a trapper out here and they can bait the little monster out.   It'll be fine.\"   I had to get some pictures so I would have something to show the boss.   A trapper showed up a little while later.  After maybe 15 minutes and a $400 check from my friend, the bear was back out in the world doing whatever bears do."
