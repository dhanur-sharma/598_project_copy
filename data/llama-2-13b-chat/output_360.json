        "Summarize the following story in first person: At the beginning of the summer, my husband had relapsed back into his meth addiction.  He had been clean for 5 years at that point.  He cheated on me with other women, he stole our bill money for drugs, and became a stranger in my soulmates body.  I realized that I had to get out of the situation, he wasn't going to stop on his own.  I began working online so I could keep an eye on the house.  One afternoon, my husband had been gone all day, I presumed he was stealing to support his habit.  All of the sudden, I saw the car he left in race past the house with police cars in pursuit.  A short time later, he tore into the driveway, with the car engine on fire, and ran in the house and into the back bedroom.  When the police knocked on the door, I was too scared to open it.  A few minutes later, they broke the window and I told them I was unarmed and coming out.  There were at least 15 police cars surrounding our street.  I was in shock and did not know how to deal.  They didn't ask me anything, they knew about the drugs and knew they weren't mine.  I lost my love that day.  The innocence of my perceived true love had forever been shattered.  It's been three months, he's been in jail since the end of June.  I still don't know what will happen to my marriage.  I don't know if anyone can come back from that.  I have hope that the man I married is still in there somewhere."
