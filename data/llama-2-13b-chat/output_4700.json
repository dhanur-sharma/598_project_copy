        "Summarize the following story in first person: This is a story about the loss of a pet.  Pets are family and should be treated as such.  A friend gave us Maggie when my children were 3 and 5. I was a single parent at the time and she was a great addition to our little family. She was just a kitten and loved to play. Maggie grew up with  my children. When I started dating my current husband he \"hated\" cats (so he said).  A few years later, my kids and I were set to move in with my then boyfriend (now husband). The deal was to have Maggie fixed and declawed and she would be fine to come along.  My children are now 21 and 24. They never knew life without Maggie.  She played with us and gave us tremendous joy. We all loved her, even our dogs.  Now she's gone and I miss her.  We buried her in the back yard and planted flowers on her grave."
