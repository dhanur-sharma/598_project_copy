        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was able to save up enough money to travel overseas. It took all spring and summer but I was able to do it. It was a lot of hard work but like I said it was worth it and taught me a lot. Belgium was a different country in a good day. I liked all of the different kinds of beer I was able to try. The food was really interesting as well. It was not something I was used to. I was not able to eat as healthy as I wanted to, oh well. The food was good and I will need to get on the treadmill as soon as I get back. I met a lot of interesting people as well. That was probably the best part about this place. All of the people just seemed nice and interested in me. All of this made studying and learning just easy. That was the easiest part. I am not sure I could have asked for more. It took awhile to adjust but this finally feels like home to me. I hope some of family can come visit soon. I think they would have a good time like I am. I think eventually I will view this place as my real home. For now though, I just need to keep on adjusting."
