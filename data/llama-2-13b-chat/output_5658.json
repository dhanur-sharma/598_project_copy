        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was a weird moment when my girlfriend  revealed to me she was cheating on me. This happened while we were out at dinner. She started crying all of a sudden and told me that she had something to tell me. We had been dating for about 2 years up until that point. She told me she had been secretly seeing a coworker for about half a year now. They really liked each other and she was basically breaking up with me. When i heard the news, my heart broke. My eyes started tearing up and i was just confused. We had just bought a new apartment together so i really couldn't put 2 and 2 together. She was someone that i really cared about. She was my first love if i had to put it in exact words. She had been lying to me this whole time. All the times she said that she loved me was all lies. I was a bowl of mixed emotions at that time. 5 months later, i am a better man and have moved on. I even met a new girl that i really liked as well."
