        "Summarize the following story in first person: My son left for college and we were all going to drive him to school so we could say goodbye and see his dorm etc.  We had to take two cars to fit the entire family and all of his stuff.   Our oldest son was murdered a few years earlier so \"losing\" another child to college was a very emotional experience.  He is also kind of an airhead so we were worried about how he was going to handle living by himself.  He was going to college about 3.5 hours away from where we live.  Close enough to visit but far enough to not want to do the drive there and back on a regular basis.  We got about half way there and the check engine light came on in my car.  We pulled over at a gas station and loaded all of his stuff into my wife's car.  Then my youngest daughter and I had to say goodbye to him in a gas station parking lot so I could drive the car back home in case something serious was wrong.  It ended up being an electrical issue and was a somewhat costly repair.  My wife and other daughter took him the rest of the way to college.  They got him set up in his dorm, took him out to lunch and then came home.  I was sad that I didn't get to take part in all of that and had my goodbye cut short.  He has been home a couple of times on breaks now. Each time he goes back it is a little easier to handle."
