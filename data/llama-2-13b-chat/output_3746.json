        "Summarize the following story in first person: I have had my cat for ten years.  When I got her she was such a breath of fresh air.  I was going through a depression and she really helped perk me up.  I mean, who can stay depressed when you have all of that kitten energy going on in your life?  I loved her so much.  When I would go through a hard day she was always there to make me feel better.  I first noticed her not feeling well about a year ago.  I took her right to the vet.  At first, they gave her some medicine and told me to watch her.  I was anxious at first but then I was elated that she started to get better.  But it didn't last long.  After an initial uptick in health, it took a bad turn for the worse and I could see tumors forming.  I panicked and took her in.  I didn't have the money for the vet so I put it on a credit card and I felt thankful to have good credit so I could help her.  I paid for a biopsy of the tumors.  The biggest moment of this experience was when the vet asked me to come in to hear the results instead of giving me the results of the biopsy over the phone.  At this moment I felt so anxious and I knew it was bad news.  When I came in they said that she had a very aggressive form of feline cancer.  Her chances, especially at her age, were not good.  Chemo treatments would cost thousands, be very painful and probably would not work.  I hated that I was considering money as one of the factors.  I didn't have thousands and it looked like it would not work.  I mean, if this was my child and it kind of is, I would say that I didn't want to pay the moeny.  In the end the doctor helped me by recommending to put her to sleep which I did.  After I oddly felt at peace knowing that she lead a good life and was no longer in pain."
