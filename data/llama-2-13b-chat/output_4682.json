        "Summarize the following story in first person: I went to my therapist appointment today. I finally told her about the problems I've been having with food for the past year, which I've been hiding from her. About eating so much I make myself sick. How I'm always thinking about food to the point where I can't concentrate. How I feel so guilty after eating. She listened to me and asked me some questions, then pulled up a little questionnaire. There were some questions about my feelings about food. There were also some about how often I binge-eat. I was embarrassed to answer those ones. I felt humiliated when she read my answers. I didn't want to talk about it, but I knew I needed to. After reading all of my answers, she said she had a new diagnoses for me. Binge eating disorder. I felt shocked and sad to hear that I have an eating disorder. I'm also very embarrassed. She wanted me to start keeping a food log and tracking my binges, while also writing down what I'm feeling before, during, and after a binge."
