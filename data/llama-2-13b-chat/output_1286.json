        "Summarize the following story in first person: Today I finally visited the Cascade mountain.  It is the highest peak of the Adirondacks mountain.  I have been wanting to make this hike for a long time and can't believe I finally did it!!  We started early in the morning to give ourselves plenty of time to make the climb and be able to enjoy the view.  It was cool and the air was so crisp.  I thought I might get tired as this was my first hike but my excitement and the distracton of the beautiful scenery kept me going.  I can remember seeing squirrels playing in the trees and hearing birds calling to each other.  I loved watching the sunrise along the way and watching the world wake up.  I loved to look at how the different trees and vegetation grew and appreciated the made trail for us.  I was surprised at how much colder it got as we wound our way higher and higher.  Once we made it to the top I couldn't believe we had made it and to see the beautiful views that are only afforded to those willing to climb to the peak.  As I surveyed the scenery I was amazed at how high we actually were and tried not to think about the descent home.   I was going to enjoy my time at the top and savor my journey for as long as possible.  We spent the afternoon at the peak and enjoyed a well deserved picnic lunch.  when it was finally time to go I took a deep breath and looked around trying to memorize each detail of this amazing journey.  What I can't capture with words and I hope will always live etched in my memory."
