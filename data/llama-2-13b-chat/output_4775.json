        "Summarize the following story in first person: Six weeks ago,  I got the best news! Because of my hard work and diligence, I was getting a promotion. I honestly wasn't expecting it, because I had been under a lot of pressure at home. My mother became sick, and moved in with our family. At the same time, I discovered my husband was having an affair. He announced he wanted a divorce. I thought that I might just break down and crack. Instead, I put my best efforts into my job. I'm so excited that it paid off. My boss said that he was impressed with everything I've done. I just started my new role as a Senior Developer. I love my new team and my new coworkers. I'm looking forward to a great future here. I'm glad that I'll also have more resources to take care of my mother. My husband can enjoy his new life of poverty without my nice paycheck."
