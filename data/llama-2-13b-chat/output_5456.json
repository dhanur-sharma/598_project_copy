        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 7months ago my husband told me he had a suprise. So i came home that day to a box! A box i know...random!!! As i open the box i sew shells glued all over it. As i start to get excited i see two tickets! Plane tickets to Florida, my favorite place in the world. He had put the plane tickets in the box.  Ive never flown so that made me nervous but non the less happy. So the time comes and we are all packed and ready. Ive never been away from our children for a full week so and a little sad but still excited. We planned to face time everyday. Once we made it to Florida i was happy again. The plane ride went amazing and we were finally there,  on the sunny beach. We did not do a lot of extra activities we spend most of our time laying on the beach and swimming. I have to say it was one of the happiest weeks of my life. It was nothing short of amazing!"

But i was happy that i got to go and experience it. The best part was the suprise of it all. My husband had planned it all and i had no clue. I will never forget this trip and the memories we made together. I love my husband for suprising me with this amazing trip."
