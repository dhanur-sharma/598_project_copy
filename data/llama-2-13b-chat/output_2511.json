        "Summarize the following story in first person: I thought that it would be a normal morning. But what I thought would be normal, turned into probably one of the worst days I have ever experienced. I woke up, and checked my phone, much as most people do. I had many missed calls and texts, which was odd. I looked at the messages, only to find that my beloved aunt had died. I was so upset. It was extremely tough to take in. When I went over to my mom, she had been crying all night. It was extremely difficult for her. Not only was I hurting, but now I also had to be tough in order to help my mom out. I was more than willing to complete the task though. I was ready to step up to the plate as the voice of reason. I love my mother so much. We had a funeral for my aunt with so much more crying. Now, we honor our aunt with a photo of her in our living room."
