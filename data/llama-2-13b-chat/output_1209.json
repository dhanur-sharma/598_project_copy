        "Summarize the following story in first person: I have been in this ATM business racket for many many years. I got my start in a great company but like many others say appreciate what you have now because on day it can be gone. In this case though I have to say don't always look back at memories and be prepared for whats to come. The company that I loved to work for got bought out by a major conglomerate in the business. We all were worried about losing our jobs which they assured was not the case. Sometimes somethings are better left unsaid. My entire department was let go in one swoop but were picked up by another service company in the same industry. We all knew we were just buying time at that point and i noticed one by one several of my coworkers were going there own way. Luckily for me i was headhunted by my former manager to another job which i didn't think was a great opportunity at the time. IN the mean time of all this moving I was keen becoming part of this company I've always been fond of, some of my coworkers even started working there. For 2 years i applied and most of the time did not receive a response. Then one day the call came, I was so excited i ran around my block with joy. The salary they promised was so outstanding and just the fact i would work with familiar faces made me so excited. To this day i love where i work, and I even intend on going to college to further pursue my career within the company. How my life changed since that day is something i will never forget. I will always never forget the path it took to get here and most importantly how God was able to guide me."
