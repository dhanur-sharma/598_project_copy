        "Summarize the following story in first person: I know I haven't updated in a while but life has been crazy. I was getting frustrated at everything back home. I did not feel happy doing anything I felt like I was stuck in this never ending cycle and had no way out. So, 8 weeks ago I left home for good. I actually moved across the world for a complete do over in my life. I made the change from living in the United States to inhabiting a Muslim country. So far I feel so welcomed. No one here knows me but I feel like I was born here. I finally feel as if I have found my place in the world... Like I have found my home. I know that home is not always a place with 4 walls, a roof, windows, and a door. Here home is a community filled with people who accept me as their own. It really makes me question if I had really been homeless every second I spent away from here. This is probably one of the best decisions I have made. Everyday is filled with something new and exciting. I have made friends that feel more like family. I don't know where this journey will take me but I am sure it's somewhere great; and I cant wait to experience it."
