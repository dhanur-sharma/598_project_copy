        "Summarize the following story in first person: About a week ago I went out to go shopping just having some me time. I was getting things that really caught my eye. Honestly I just went to shop for clothes but I ended up getting and doing more stuff. I maybe bought about $500 worth of things that day. It was fun spending that money. I then walked past a movie theatre that had a movie that I seen on tv. I recently read about the movie as well. I thought it would be interesting because it related to the beatles. At the time I was alone but I had the time so I just went alone to see the movie. Turns out it was a very good movie. I ended up going a 2nd time to see the movie again. I didn't go alone this time however I took my husband along with me to see it and I took my girlfriend. They both really liked the movie as well and they each seen the movie again on their own time. It was really unexpected to find a movie so good. I had fun hanging out and seeing a flick with them."
