        "Summarize the following story in first person: The loss of life is a serious occurence. When someone close to you moves on you can be left feeling alone and trapped, wondering how you'll ever move forward. This is what happened to young anita. A schoolgirl the age of 16, anita always wondered what the life of an average teenager was like. Since the age of 10 she had been taking care of her sick mother. She would bathe her, feed her, even change her. She was a good student but her social life suffered. Never having any free time to mingle or get close to someone. She feared inviting people over. What would they think? At 16 years old she still feared CPS would knock on their door anyday to take her away. Doctors visits were always a blessing. They reassured her that her mom was in stable condition and she had nothig to worry about. \"just keep doing what youre doing\" ,they told her. She had to do what she could and now her mother is gone. She has no one else."
