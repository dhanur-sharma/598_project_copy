        "Summarize the following story in first person: The most recent memorable event was learning that my mom has a personality disorder call Narcissist Personality Disorder. It explained so much of my youth and adult life living with her and interacting with her. My siblings and I were never encouraged to be together, to congratulate each other, to help each other by her. We were only told of the negative things that each one had supposedly done and that we all had some type of grudge against each other. Therefore we all grew apart and did not trust each other. We were not a close family or even a fake family. We all basically just knew of each other. Learning that she has the disorder put a lot into perspective but does not allow for resolution or closure with her. Even with her diagnosis she does not admit anything. She still wants to be the \"pit stop\" among the children. Unfortunately, I see the same pattern in my siblings and myself.  At this point I cannot communicate with her. She has a great burden about me from my childhood that she has not yet acknowledged. So I am always-in her mind-trying to retaliate. She tells this to the family and they do not know which is truth and have chosen to believe her. I am leaving them and her alone as it will do no good until someone else is on the receiving end of the vitriol."
