        "Summarize the following story in first person: Well, it's been almost two years (20 months) since I married Isabel and with her birthday tomorrow, I just felt an overwhelming sense of gratitude for her and felt compelled to write. Isa is the absolute light of my life, the person who gets me and honestly knows me better than myself. You know how sometimes parties suck and are too much energy to deal with and you just want to go home with your partner and eat frozen people in front of the TV? That's how I feel most of the time (because I am an introvert). Except, at my wedding, arguably the most important party I'll go to. Even with all the bells and whistles and people coming up to talk to me and speeches and corny dancing, looking at her made all of my anxiety fall away. I was so scared about this wedding - how my friends and family would react to a woman marrying another woman, and who would even show up to this thing. Even though I KNOW everyone I love just wants me to be happy, as far as I know, I'm the only person in my family who has come out as gay or bisexual. We had our wedding overlooking the beach in her quaint Massachusetts hometown, which reminded me of the beach I would go to in Maryland. It felt most crisp than usual for May, probably because of the sea breeze, and I inhaled the salty sea air and smiled as I stood at the altar and let my eyes wander through my crowd of loved ones. The sky matched the light gray stone slate of the rock wall but I could see the sun glowing behind the sheet of clouds. I don't even remember the music starting, there was a ringing in my ears and then Isa appeared at the end of the aisle. My best friend, soulmate, soul sister, love of my life who makes me a better person every day. I'm sure my jaw was on the floor while I watched her come toward me, but I was having deja vu of every one of her smile-laughs, our happiest moments, just radiating from her face. While the chaplain spoke I watched a raindrop catch on her eyelashes and felt a few drops on my forehead.  Soon the sky was giving us little wet raindrop kisses all over our faces, and we leaned in and embraced just as the rain broke through."

I felt like I could hear our hearts beating together, and I was so grateful that I was marrying her.  And that's why I feel so lucky to be married to her. Even though we have our disagreements, and I'm sure there will be more in the future, I'm grateful that I have her in my life, and that I get to call her my wife.  I know it's not for everyone, but I love being married. I love knowing that I get to wake up to her every morning, and go to sleep with her every night. I love that I get to hold her hand in public and not feel embarrassed. I love that I get to call her my wife and have that be a thing that other people can see and know. I love that I get to be with her and love her and support her and be supported by her. I love that I get to be her partner and that she gets to be mine. And I love that we get to"
