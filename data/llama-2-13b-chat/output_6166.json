        "Summarize the following story in first person: Do you remember Larry? He was the guy that I used to work with that was a really great friend of mine but had cut contact with me after he got married. Anyway, it has been years since I heard from him. Not a peep. Not even mutual friends have heard from him. It was really weird and concerning how he dropped all of us like that. Well, the other day he had called me and left a message for me to call him and gave me his new phone number. I don't know what I was expecting, so I called him back. He seemed really upbeat and happy. I asked him how life was and he said it was going better. He had just gotten divorced and was moving back to the city. Turns out, his wife and him had moved out of the city to a new area away from everyone. I also found out that she was abusive to him and he had to get away from all of that. I told him he was a smart guy for doing that. We made plans to get together and grab some food.  I asked other friend if they had heard from him and they all have. It's just really nice to have someone that I cared about so much back in my life!"
