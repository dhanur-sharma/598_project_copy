        "Summarize the following story in first person: I remember when i brought her home from the hospital. Everyone had high hopes back then. It didn't take long for reality to come crashing back down on us all. All i do is pray that things get better. There's nothing left to do. I go to work and come home to an empty house, the sound of a baby crying is now a distant memory after her departure. Its her fault this happened. She goes out and gets high and doesn't care who she brings around. It was only a matter of time before she got pulled over, drunk, with our baby in the front seat. I go to these parenting classes because i'm forced to. I'm already the perfect dad, wish i could say the same about my other half. The only time she comes home is to sleep before taking off on another bender. The divorce will be final soon, then all ill need to worry about is my baby girl, i know she will be home in no time. I just have to keep plugging away and hope for the best. God is by my side, although sometimes its easy to forget that. Its his strength that keeps me going. I just hope that there really is a light at the end of this never ending tunnel. I haven't seen it yet, but its there."
