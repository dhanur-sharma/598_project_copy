        "Summarize the following story in first person: A week ago we celebrated my husband's aunt Judith's birthday.  This was her first birthday since her second marriage and though she and I were never close, I was happy to be part of the celebrations.  It was last morning Saturday when we drove to her house.  My husband's family members who joined in the party came from far away.  I think almost ten people altogether showed up to wish her a happy birthday.  Judith and her new husband Max had prepared a feast for everyone.  The barbeque was lit in the backyard and all day we enjoyed hamburgers cooked to order.  I talked to Judith for awhile and caught up on everything.  I hadn't seen her in so long that it was a surprise for me to see how much weight she had lost and how healthy she looked.  Most of my husband's family lives far away from Judith, only my husband lives in the same town so oftentimes it's only at special gatherings like this one that my husband gets to mingle with his family.  I could see that my husband was enjoying himself.  In the afternoon, some of the older kids took the younger ones out for ice cream at the local mall while the adults stayed home and sat in the living room talking to one another.  During the party, we learned from Judith that she was planning on retiring from her job later this year.  This would give her and her new husband more time to travel around the country sightseeing.  I was so happy for her.  In the late evening, we all gathered around the fire in the backyard and made s'mores.  My favorite part of this birthday party was when my husband's aunt opened up her gifts.  This year my husband and I had gotten her a set of teacups.  These teacups were specially made with my aunt's initials etched on them.  When we saw them, her eyes lit up and she smiled the biggest smile I had seen from her."
