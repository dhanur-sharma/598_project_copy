        "Summarize the following story in first person: Yesterday was July 24, a memorable day for sure and my birthday! Artia and I bonded and grew closer as we visited the six flags in my town. Everyone was there, my husband and my sister with her daughter Jang. She and Artia have become so close. Artia also invited her friend from school to come along.  We had a great start to the afternoon at this fancy artsy restaurant. They painted our food on the table and we laughed and admired the scenery around us. Afterwards, we headed to the nearby six flags to lose our minds on some roller coasters. The most enjoybale and surprising thing that happened was a stranger bought everyone ice cream when we visited an ice cream store inside the park. I really think it was one of the best times of my life. Enjoying such dazzling feelings of closeness to my family, the love of them celebrating me; it was incredibly meaningful. I love them all. Whether they are screaming for terror on the biggest roller coaster or just having a simple meal with me, I know that they are there with me. that connection is so valuable. I intend to always be there for them."
