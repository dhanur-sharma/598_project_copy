        "Summarize the following story in first person: So something amazing happened two months ago. What? I met Ased. Yes, the same Ased who was my best friend in high school, actually, we were kind of inseparable. Then life happened, I had to move states and so did he after his parents divorced. We kept touch for a while on the internet but then, you know. So it had been almost a decade since we last spoke and two months ago I was walking around a mall and someone tapped on my shoulder. I looked back and no, I did not remember him but then a light bulb went on inside my brain. We hugged it out and he we sit down to chat, he told me he was waiting for his wife. And you, wouldn't believe, who his wife was. Yes, the same neighborhood girl, he had a crush on back then. She was as surprised to see me as I was to see her. We talked and talked and talked, he told me that he had served a few tours in army and was not on social media. I told him what I was up to and invited him home. They told me that they were are looking for homes in the area as they are planning to settle here once he comes comes back from his last tour in couple of months and then they will invite me to their home. And guess what, we, well mostly Rach, the wife and I kept in touch since and he is coming back this week and I will be going to their home soon. So, here is to meeting old friends and making great memories."
