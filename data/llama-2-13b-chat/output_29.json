        "Summarize the following story in first person: There was a recent event that happened last Tuesday that was pretty interesting and memorable. I was shopping in a grocery store and there was quite a few people there that day. When I was shopping, I went to grab a griddle, but as I grabbed it there was a woman right behind me who started questioning me and cussing me out for taking the last available griddle. I had to defend my purchase, so I just ignored her and kept shopping. Later on, I left my cart alone and noticed that the woman took my griddle out of my shopping cart, which pretty infuriating. I secretly \"stole\" it back into my cart without her noticing and watched her checkout without realizing it was gone. I felt bad but at the same time I found the griddle first. I wish that I could have seen her realize that she didn't have the griddle in the parking lot but I didn't get the chance to see this woman again. I felt proud that I was able to get the last griddle and I have no regrets. I think it is absolutely ridiculous to get angry at a stranger for something like that. If possible, I would have recorded this situation and uploaded it because I just think it's funny. Anyway, the griddle works perfectly and for only $20 I am satisfied with my purchase. I made pancakes with it this morning and some eggs. I still think about it though with some shame. I hate being mean to people but this was my griddle, once again."
