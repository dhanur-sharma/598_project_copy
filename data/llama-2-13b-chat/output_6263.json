About four months ago, we went out on a nice date. We ate and talked in the fabulous restaurant. At the end, I got the surprise of my life. The desert was brought out to us. On my plate was written \"Will you marry me?\" in chocolate! Oh my goodness, I was so surprised. This was so unexpected. Tears welled up in my eyes as I gleamed yes to him. Everyone in the restaurant was watching with anticipation and begin clapping and chearing. We hugged and kissed to a round of applause from the staff and other customers. We are beginning our new lives together. We are planning to be married just before the baby is due."
