        "Summarize the following story in first person: The Monday of the week of the Fourth of July, I randomly went out for a drink after a long day. After ordering a drink from a bartender friend at a local bar, and relaxing, going through some news alerts and other notifications on my phone, my friend introduced me to another patron at the bar. We were only around 5 or so people in the bar at the time, so my friend introduced to me a guy who had just moved to the area for a job. We started talking that night about random things, but mostly about music and played different music we liked on the jukebox. I ended up talking with my now boyfriend for the rest of the night until the bar closed, but we didn't exchange any information with one another to get in contact again. I went back to the same bar two nights later and I was happy to see this guy, my current boyfriend, again in the bar. We ended up talking the rest of the night there and until the early morning hours, since neither of us had to worry about work the next day, since it was the July 4th holiday. We exchanged phone numbers when we went to our homes, and made plans to see one another the next day. We did not actually see each other on the 4th, however, but we did re-make the plans and met on that Friday the 5th. After seeing each other again that Friday, our chemistry was undeniable and we both knew we liked one another. From that point, we were seeing each other every day, if only for a few hours a day. Soon after, we actually made our relationship official, even though friends had already assumed we were together since we were always together when we would go out, whether to the bar we met or to a restaurant or a movie. A few weeks into dating officially, it was my birthday and my boyfriend took me to a really nice birthday dinner and we starting talking more about the future and our future together. About a month later, my boyfriend officially moved in with me, because we were spending so much time together and our feelings were real, so it made sense and we wanted to do so to spend more time together. It has been 20 weeks since we met, to the day, and our relationship has only gotten stronger as we have lived together and continued to learn more about each other. I could not have imagined that going for a drink on a random Monday night would have led to me meeting the man I hope to spend the rest of my life with, but 20 weeks ago it did happen and I'm grateful to my friend for introducing us that night."
