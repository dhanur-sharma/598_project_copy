        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last weekend I went to a party at friends house for his 30th birthday. He was inviting a lot of other friends, and he was making a sort of event about the whole thing, marking it as both his birthday as well as his funeral. There was going to nearly 50 people there, some I was already very friendly with and some new faces, as well as lots of food, lots of drinks, and lots of games. I was very much looking forward to the party but a little bit nervous about meeting so many new people at once, as I am somewhat shy. I went over in mind about maybe backing out, maybe only sticking with the few friends there I already knew very well, but eventually I settled on just sucking it up and going on my own. When I got there, I instantly felt somewhat out of place because I only knew a few faces, but that did not deter me from having my mind set on having a good time. I threw myself out there in some games, got talking to a lot of new people, and ended up making a lot of new friends throughout the night. As it went on, I felt less and less shy and nervous about trying to make a good impression. I began to be able to break out of my shell and act like myself, and I am so glad I did. The whole party was an absolute blast and I made a lot of friends, many of whom I will be contacting in the future with more plans to hang out. This party was a big step for me. It has been awhile since I have been able to put myself out there and try to meet new people. I was nervous about whether or not these new friends would be receptive to my personality or if I would come off as the weird awkward dude in the corner. My good friends who were there even commented on how they were impressed with how social I was being with total strangers. That might have been helped by the few beers I had, but that liquid courage got me past the first few hurdles I needed help with. I need to just be more confident in myself as a person, and the people around me will start to see me in a better light."
