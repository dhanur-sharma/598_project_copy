        "Summarize the following story in first person: Several months ago I was struggling with substance abuse and mental health issues. I was self-treating anxiety and depression with alcohol. Early on it was moderate - a few glasses of wine here and there throughout the week. One glass with dinner became two. Two became four throughout the day. That slowly morphed into my weight-loss diet. No food, just wine, and I lost 50lbs. I felt great about that, but elsewhere my life was crumbling. Missing work, deteriorating social relationships, and increasing mental health instability. As the weeks passed I became unsatisfied with just the buzz of alcohol. I decided to mix pills. A benadryl here and there. Vicoden when it was available. Then onto over the counter cold medications such as NyQuil. Quickly discovered that this combination -NyQuil and Alcohol- was severely liberating. To combat the drowsiness I kept Red Bull and other energy drinks on hand at all times. This became my regular recreational escape from reality. One night, after having little to nothing to eat for several days, I went on my usual trip. NyQuil, energy drinks and wine throughout the night. As the evening progressed I became more aware that I had taken too much of one or another of the substances. I decided to go into the kitchen for something to eat to more quickly pass the chemicals. I laid my head down on the counter to contemplate what to eat. Next thing I know I awake in a pool of blood on the tile floor. Nose shattered and a small forehead lacerated. No ER visit necessary, or surgery, but waking up in a pool of your own blood is enough of a wake up call that it would make an addict go clean, at least for as long as the monkey on his back allowed."
