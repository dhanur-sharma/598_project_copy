        "Summarize the following story in first person: Ever since our third date, when we jokingly discussed names for our future children, my fiance and I have both wanted to start a family. A year ago, we moved in together into a small house with 3 bedrooms, one for us, one for an office, and one that we described to our friends and family as a \"guest bedroom\". But we both knew it was going to be a nursery. I went off my birth control soon after we settled in. Over the past year, I've been carefully marking the calendar and stocking up on pregnancy tests, every month a little more disappointed and anxious when my cycle continued as normal. Finally, five months ago, I saw the double lines on the test, and I came running out of the bathroom like a crazy person. My fiance was in disbelief at first. (\"Are you sure this test isn't past the expiration date? Can you pee on another one?\"). We drove to the store for two different brands of tests to confirm the good news, and ever since we've been in serious nesting mode. We just had our first ultrasound this week, and not only is the baby doing great, but it's going to be a boy!  We were really surprised, since we'd both been sure we were having a girl. Luckily, I grew up with lots of younger boy cousins, and my fiance only has brothers, so we think we have a pretty good handle on what the next decade is going to be like for us. Seeing that little face on the screen was amazing. We're over the moon excited, and can't wait to greet our son in just four short months!"
