        "Summarize the following story in first person: so basically i was sitting in the living room watching the game like i usually do on a sunday. My daughter comes up to me and says she has something really important to talk to me about. I noticed that she looked really nervous and fidgety, her eyes darting around the room. I leaned in and assured her that she could tell me anything, i'm her father! i smiled real big and took her hand, i knew she was bisexual already, i mean i could tell the way she was looking at the cheerleaders when we watched football together. i knew because it reminded me of me! Like i said shes my daughter and i just wanted her to be happy. i said i think it would be a good idea if we met this young lady and got to know her. She started crying and threw herself into my arms. Said she wasn't sure what to think because of the way everyone behaves towards people like her in the news. i told her to ignore those people they were just ignorant and that her life doesn't hurt anyone else. Shes such a good girl and i love her so much. i never want to see her worried like that again. But of course i don't, im her father. i know how cruel the world can be. i will always do everything i can to shield her from it...always."
