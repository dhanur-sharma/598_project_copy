        "Summarize the following story in first person: I really respect cab drivers. They seem to be able to handle everything and never get stressed out. A few months ago I was scheduled for an important doctors appointment. It was the sonogram where I was supposed to find out if I was having a boy or a girl. I had been waiting weeks for this appointment. I knew if I missed it that would mean waiting at least another week or two for a new appointment. I had to make the appointment. I called for the cab with plenty of time to spare. I figured I would be at least an hour early. Unfortunately, as soon as I stepped into the cab it started snowing. Not just regular fluffy snow. It was pouring snowflakes. I could barely see. The roads seemed to get covered in seconds. And then the traffic started. Everyone slammed on their breaks and caused a mess of crashes and rubbernecking. I had never seen anything like it. I remember staring at the little clock on the cabs dashboard. I had to make this appointment. The cab driver didn't seem too hopeful. He was trying his best. After almost 2 hours of sitting in this horrible snow traffic the driver suddenly turned down a side road. I was going to ask where he was going but I figured who cares at this point. I watched as he wove up and down streets I had never seen. And then, miraculously, he pulled into my doctors parking lot on time."
