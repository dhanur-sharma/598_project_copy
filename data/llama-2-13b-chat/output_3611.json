        "Summarize the following story in first person: I broke up with my long term girlfriend & to me it was more a formality then a big deal. We had grown apart as the years had gone on.  She had become a lot more cold towards me & had started to ignore or delay responding to me. When I told her it was over she started crying & got really emotional which surprised me. I didn't think she'd even care the way she'd been acting. I knew there was no changing my feelings or mind so it didn't effect me. She had just made me numb towards her. She had been taking me for granted & I could tell she didn't really care anymore. We had been seeing & talking to each other less & less. We were having less sex & she just didn't seem too into me anymore. I'm too proud to be in that kind of relationship. I still have positive feelings for her but have no urge to talk to her or be a part of her life. My grandmother had just died so maybe that made the whole thing seem small in comparison. I wish she had shown the emotion she showed when I told her I was leaving when I was around. That would have been nice."
