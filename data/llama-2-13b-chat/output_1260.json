        "Summarize the following story in first person: About two weeks ago I adopted a new cat.  I go to a local pet store once a week or once every two weeks to buy supplies for my animals.  I often take my husband to the pat store with me so that he can carry the heavier items that I purchase. At the back of the pet store there is a small room that has a big window so people can see in.  Inside the room are several cages where cats are kept that are available for adoption.  Several months ago, my husband noticed an orange cat with the name Ivan in one of the cages and he seemed to really like him.  Week after week I would go to the pet store and pass by this room.  I could not help but notice that while many of the other cages were filled with different cats each week, Ivan never moved.  He just sat in his small cage waiting to be adopted.  The store lowered his adoption fee several times but, still no one wanted Ivan. It made me very sad to see him sitting there so, on the next trip to the pet store, I took my husband again.  I showed him that Ivan was still there and asked an employee to let him meet the lonely cat.  It was instant love.  Ivan almost jumped into my husbands arms and purred.  It was like he knew they were going to be together. I signed some paperwork and bought a few new toys while they got acquainted.  My husbands eyes lit up when I came back with a box to take Ivan home in.  When we got home, Ivan seemed comfortable like he had always been there."
