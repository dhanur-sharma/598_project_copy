        "Summarize the following story in first person: You know how we were going through changes at work? We did end up with that new boss that people said was coming. He seems like a nice guy, but man if he tough on people. He's going around changing things and people don't like that. I get it, after working there so long and being used to one way of doing things it is hard to do them another way. I'm someone who really likes a challenge and learning new ways of doing things so I was happy to learn something new. As soon as I could, I went to the new boss and introduced myself. I listened to his ideas and helped make sense of them with other people. I took the extra steps needed to get through to people on the new changes. I honestly thought a lot of the changes were good ideas. Not everyone did, sadly. A few days later, the boss came over to me and told me that I was really helping him out and he appreciated that. Then asked if I had ever thought about being a lead in a company. I was honest and told him that I never thought that kind of opportunity would come to someone like me. He told me that I was a good hand and I deserved to be a lead. The next few days, I got called into his office a lot and talked to about what it takes to be a lead. I ended up taking that spot and got a really nice bonus out of it as well!"
