        "Summarize the following story in first person: Four months ago I was promoted at work!  I was not expecting this at all.  After the previous supervisor left I knew they were looking for someone to fill the void, but this did take me by surprise!  I know my boss has a lot of confidence in me and this promotion confirmed it.  My colleagues took me out to celebrate this great occasion!  I got a nice raise and I feel I also have more prestige in the company.  I also feel I have a lot more responsibility, which is something that I like.  I am now in charge of my group's decision making.  We all get along well, so this is a group effort.  Once in awhile we have a little disagreement, but usually thinks go quite smoothly.  Last week we had to come together to consider what kind of advertisement campaign we will come up with for an important client.  We had so many creative ideas!  It was exciting to see what everyone brought to the table.  After a few meetings, we honed it down to four choices.  We looked at all the positives and negatives of the ideas.  Ultimately, I had to make the final decision on this project.  We presented it to my boss.  It went very well and he was pleased that we did such a great job.  I feel like this could take me pretty far in this company and I can't wait to get busy on the next project.  I may even get to a higher position if I keep this up!"
