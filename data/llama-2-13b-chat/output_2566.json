        "Summarize the following story in first person: A couple of weeks ago I went to a music festival with some friends. We got free tickets because my best friend was a vendor for the festival. He was stoked to be able to provide a service for the event and also get free tickets to be able to share with his friends. We all met up in his hometown the night before and went out to eat. The next day, the day of the festival, my best friend had to head in to work for the festival, and the rest of us start the pre-festival activities. I wasn't expecting to have the best weekend of my life, but I have got to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience. I have to say that it wasn't the festival that made this weekend so unforgettable, but the people that I was able to share it with. It has been a while since all of my high school friends were able to get together for a weekend getaway, but this only made me miss them more. We had an absolute blast! There was music of all sorts there. There were also a lot of art vendors that had all of their awesome artwork on display. I got to try foods that I had never heard of. The festival lasted well into the night, and we were all able to share experiences with each other. Overall the weekend was amazing. We all said our goodbyes in the end, and are looking forward to doing the same thing again next year!"
