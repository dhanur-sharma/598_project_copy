        "Summarize the following story in first person: My daughter's father was killed in a car accident a few months ago.   He was traveling on the highway in early April.  As we live in Michigan, we often experience sudden changes in weather during these months. At 70 mph, he hit a patch of black ice, skidded across the median and crashed into another car head on.  He and others were instantly killed.  I woke up to 4 sheriff's standing outside my door to tell my daughter and I the news.  In the months that have passed, we have attended grief counseling - both group and family.  We have managed to say goodbye and have come to terms with the suddenness of the situation.  We are blessed to have an incredible support network of family and friends.  Unfortunately, death always brings out the worst in some, and we have had to sever ties with some of the people we used to be closest to, but in the end, we do not need this toxicity in our lives as we rebuild and try to move forward.   I know that he would want to be remembered, but not mourned.  He would want us to move forward and make him proud.  He wouldn't want us sad and depressed.  We are trying to honor that in our words and actions.  No one leaves this house without a  hug, a goodbye, and an I love you.  Life can change at any given moment.  Lesson learned, Life."
