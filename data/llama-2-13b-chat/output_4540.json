        "Summarize the following story in first person: A little over a year ago I put my house on the market to avoid foreclosure.  It was a sudden decision but the only way I could see out of my situation.  I knew I would have to take a loss on it.  This however looked better than risking the foreclosure.  Unfortunately, my house sat on the market for a year.  About a month ago it hit the point where I could no longer afford to sell it.  This was because the lawyer;s fees made the payoff amount to steep.  This was really a blow to me and I am unsure how to go forward from here.  I must remain in the house but also find some way to deal with the payments and avoid foreclosure.  I think I may become a gold-digger and find myself a rich widow.  Perhaps, I'll rob a bank.  I am really not sure what to do at this point.  I am all out of options.  Existence seems bleak and miserable.  I am open to receiving any help."
