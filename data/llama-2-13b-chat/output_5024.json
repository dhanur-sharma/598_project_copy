        "Summarize the following story in first person: This past Mother's Day, my seven year old son presented me with a card. Inside he wrote a poem that said \" I love you evree second, I love you evree minute, I love you evree hour, I love you evree day, I love you evree year.\" It was written on a piece of notebook paper with torn edges. It was decorated with hearts and stick figures of him and I. When he gave me the card he was a little embarrassed and told me to read it while he was in the other room. I looked at my husband and asked if he put him up to it and he said \"No, I had no idea!\" I read the little card and tears began to stream down my cheeks. I saw him peep around the doorway of the kitchen and then he ran and gave me a giant hug.  I'm writing about this because it profoundly impacted me as a mother and a human. To create a tiny creature that has the wherewithal  to write poetry was astounding. The fact that he loves me so much he sat down and thought of those words was beyond amazing. That evening once the kids went to bed, I sat on the porch in quiet contemplation. I have been a mother for seven years and a step-mother for nine years. To be honest, sometimes I feel that I'm failing. I'm not a perfect mom. My hair never looks good, I forget about PTO meetings. I listen to Punk and Metal. None of those things matter to my children. In the eyes of my children I am worthy of poetry and that's all that matters."
