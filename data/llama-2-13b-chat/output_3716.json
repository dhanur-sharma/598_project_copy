        "Summarize the following story in first person: I'm still so angry at mom for not admitting she's wrong!  I finally got the courage to tell her how her hitting me when I was younger really affected me and she still feels like she's justified in it.  I mean, WHO HITS HER KID??!!  Especially when it was for something so dumb like not cleaning my room.  Yea I know I should have just cleaned it, but it's not THAT serious.  I just cant get past it.  I want mom to say at least she's sorry for it and then maybe we can move on.  I can't forgive it right now.  I want her to acknowledge she did something wrong, for once.  She never admits anything.  She thinks she's right about EVERYTHING!  UGH, so frustrating.  Sometimes I just hate her. Why do parent's do that.  Just say, oops I made a big mistake and it wont happen again.  I want our relationship to go back to when we were happy and talking.  I can't even look at her these past 2 weeks.  Ok, that's all for now, I'll type more later."
