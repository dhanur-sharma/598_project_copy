        "Summarize the following story in first person: I experienced the death of my two in laws and my dad within last six months. It was totally unexpected and it just came so suddenly. All three of them were in fair health condition before, but their health suddenly deteriorated so badly that led to their death. I felt so hopeless and unprepared. It seemed like we just talked not too long ago, but suddenly you just could not see the person again forever! Having someone so close to you passed away made you sad and rethink the meaning of life. What is most important? What would you want to do if this is your last moment? We just cannot waste time on trivial things, because we can die any moment! It does't matter whether you are old or young. Life is really short and unexpected , and we need to cherish every moment of it. I want to spend more time with my loved ones, and make more memory. Also, I want to go with my hearts to do what I like. Stop complaining and just act! You never know what your last moment will come, and hopefully, I live to the fullest of life before the end of it."
