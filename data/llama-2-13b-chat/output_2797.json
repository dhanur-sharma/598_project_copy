        "Summarize the following story in first person: My husband and I bought our first house 4 months ago. I had been waiting for this my whole life. My credit was great, and we finally had enough for a down payment.  I was so excited and nervous.      The whole process took a few months before we closed on the house.  The situation was stressful and time consuming. From loan applications to house hunting, the days were long. We would put in offers and wait to hear if they were accepted. We were so happy that we found a house in a great area, and that the sellers accepted our offer which was below asking price!     Then we had to schedule home inspections and a carpet company.  We also had to wait and make sure the seller fixed the things they were supposed to.  Finally everything fell into place and we were officially home owners!! When I went and got the keys and walked into my own home for the first time, it was the best feeling. Now we could really get to work making it our own.  Our days of paying rent were over!  My husband and I really worked as a team through the whole process, and we were so happy it all worked out."
