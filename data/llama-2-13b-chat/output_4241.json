        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was part of attending a celebration of the installment of new grassy turf on the playground at the animal shelter.  The shelter invited the media and other guests to share the celebration of getting this turf installed.  The turf was donated by a company in the community.  For many years all there was was dirt on the playground and the dogs would get very dirty when they went out to play.  Several volunteer groups were instrumental in getting this turf.  The local commissioners were there for the celebration and the shelter chief was there for the celebration.  Refreshments were served and shelter souvenirs were available to give to selected participants in the celebration.  Many of the old volunteers were at the celebration and we all were so excited.    The playground looked great and the turf is so much better for the dogs to go out and play.  They don't have to have a bath now after playing on the playground.  The installation of the new turf was part of some revitalization of the shelter to show the community that the new management was serious about helping the shelter environment.    I walked around and met several old friends that had been a part of the shelter.  It was a very good day to see this finally installed for the dogs.  It was a great day for talking about the future of the shelter with more improvments to come.  The community came together for this project."
