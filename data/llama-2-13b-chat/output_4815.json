        "Summarize the following story in first person: I start talking to this one girl I met about a year ago. We had been on and off chatting about school, work, life, and other subjects of that nature. At first it wasn't really like I was trying to get with her or anything else. I simply enjoyed talking to her and as we progressed we start opening up more and more. We both attend the same convention every year, so we started planning stuff to do while hanging out. This would not be one on one dates or hangouts but just places in general that we could go with other people we met at the convention. Well the convention was last month and in Texas which is her home state. I got there the Saturday before the con while she got there 3 days later. I had realized around January that I had liked her a lot but didn't want to tell her because I have a fear of rejection and asking her would just make things awkward. So when we went to eat ramen and play mini-golf  with a group of our friends not much happen. At ramen I wasn't able to sit next to her, but at mini-golf we were joking around with each other. Later we all went to the bars and as the night progressed we were holding hands and hugging. Even still I didn't really act on the anything because we were drunk and she could've just been being friendly. Basically the next day we did the same things: ate with a group of people, played games, and went out to the bars. This time however we kissed, so I thought that meant we were in the clear to confess our feelings for each other. The next day I woke up to a \"why did we kiss\" text. I was kind of nervous to answer cause i felt it was a mistake but i told her that I liked her. I was sure she was going to reject me and things would be awkward but instead she said she liked me too and that I should've asked her out earlier. So basically later that day I asked her out officially and we have been dating ever since. I was quite shocked and still am because I have never had a girlfriend before her. All I have gotten are rejections to the point I'm unwilling to ask because I know the answer will be no."
