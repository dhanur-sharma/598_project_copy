        "Summarize the following story in first person: This year, I went to the SpongeBob SquarePants 400 at Kansas Speedway. I got there early, and found out that Kevin Harvick was going to be at his merchandise hauler signing autographs.  It was very hot that day. After buying a program for Kevin to sign, I got in line. Standing next to me is a man and his son, who appears to be at most 10 years old. They had Harvick shirts on.  The two of them are getting their stuff ready to be signed, as the dad pulls out a die-cast car and hands the kid a picture. As Kevin comes towards us, the kid holds the picture out for Kevin to sign. It is as this point that I see the picture in all of its glory. Kevin takes the picture, sees what\u2019s on it, and starts laughing. He says in between laughs, \u201cI was wondering when I was going to sign this picture.\u201d He signs the picture, then takes off his hat, signs it, and puts on the kid\u2019s head. Kevin tells the kid to \u201ckeep being awesome\u201d, gives him a fist bump, and then continues signing autographs. That kid walked away with the biggest smile on his face, and so did his dad. And that is my best driver story. A race I'll never forget."
