        "Summarize the following story in first person: A few weeks ago I went to visit my boyfriend who is away for training. I went with two of my friends on the four hour road trip to visit him. We stayed at a hotel in a very rural town. The only restaurant open past 10 p.m. was a Waffle House. It was so strange to be in a place where there was nothing open at night and it was dark and quiet. It's a totally different type of city than where I am from. The day after arriving, I visited my boyfriend at his training. The drive was so interesting. I drove past expansive farms and green fields. There were so many horses and cows. I finally arrived to his training facility and I spent the day with him which was absolutely amazing. I went back to the hotel after. The next day, I went to see him again. After the visiting period ended, I went back to the hotel and drove back home with my friends. It was so good to see my boyfriend, especially knowing it may be a few more months before I see him again."
