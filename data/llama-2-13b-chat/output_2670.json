        "Summarize the following story in first person: A week ago, I was visiting my family back home since I had taken some time off from work. I drove in to visit my parents and siblings and we all decided to go to the Aquarium since my nieces had never been. That morning, I got up at my parents' house and ate some breakfast and some coffee while we chatted and watched some TV. My parents, my brother and I were going to drive over to the Aquarium later that morning to meet my sister and her husband and their kids. After breakfast, we hopped in the car and we drove off to meet up with the rest of the family. When we arrived at the aquarium, we found a parking spot and pulled in. We had arrived a little bit early so we sat in the car and waited for my sister to show up. We saw their car pull into the parking lot and my dad waved them over so they could park near us. Their family got out of the car and I gave my sister and her husband a hug since I hadn't seen them in a long time. I said hi to my nieces and we walked over to the entrance to the Aquarium. We got in line to get in as we looked at the walls painted with water and fish images. My nieces were enthralled by the walls and we hadn't even gotten inside yet. Upon walking through the gate, we were greeted by a large water tank filled with colorful fish and plantlife. My nieces immediately ran up to the tank and pressed their faces against it so they could look at it closely. We all laughed at how excited the girls were as we discussed where to go first. We decided to visit the penguins first since one of my nieces loves penguins. We walked down a hallway that had been painted to look like a glacier as we approached the room with penguins in it. Inside, there was a tank with water and ice and several penguins were swimming while others were walking around on top of the ice. My niece shrieked with excitement and started jumping up and down. We then visited the exhibit that had a couple sharks in it, but didn't stay for long since my nieces were a bit creeped out due to the darkness of the room and the sharks. We then stopped off to see a killer whale, but it was quite busy so we didn't get a great look at it. We stopped off at the gift shop on the way out and my nieces both got a stuffed penguin. We said our goodbyes and we drove our separate ways after having a very fun day with each other."
