        "Summarize the following story in first person: a few months ago, myself, my husband, my kids. his brother, his kids and his other brother and his wife all went to the dunes in michagan. we got up early in the morning and packed the car up, packed the kids in and drove for about 3 hours to the dunes. when we finally got there we parked, and we had no service, we couldn't find his brothers , because we had no cell reception. after my husband unloaded the car and left us when the stuff, he went to go find the other 2 brothers. he went walking all over the beach. it took almost an hour to find them. he came back with them, and then they reloaded everything back in to van and we drove back to the side where they were. we all got to the tent his brother had set up and shortly after, we went to go swim with the kids. we left the water and went back to the tent and talked a little and ate some chips. the kids and their older cousin stayed in the water with my kids. the adults stayed in the water and talked. we chat about a lot of things, without our phones. i feel like we really bonded on that trip. after that we got hungry and we the guys went and grilled some burgers while his brothers wife stayed with me. we watched the kids and shortly after they got back with the food and they set all of the food up. we ate burgers and turkey dogs. after that we all swam a little more and then packed up. we went for a walk after that to this hilly place near the dunes and took family photos, after that we left and went to get ice cream and went home."
