        "Summarize the following story in first person: I had been together with my boyfriend for about 5 years now. Lately we stop using condoms because my partner was bored and wanted to try something new. We decided to started a new method then which ends up resulting in buying anticonceptive pills and me starting to take them. The first months were alright, just a few minor side effects and that was all. However after a few months, like at the 4th month I started to get disorganized with the pill ingest and I most likely messed up by then, I just remembering this because for some reasons these thoughts have been coming back to my mind. Anyways, that moment probably was key to the next events. I started to gain weight, I though it was a side effect and then nausea and vomits made their appearance so we naturally started to worry. The next day we went to the doctor's office and the first thing he asked me to do was to take a pregnancy test. We drove to the pharmace while we were in silent to assimilate this probability. We reached the store, we came in and we grasp the pregnancy test alongside a few things to distract our minds. We continued to drive in absolute silent until we got home. I quickly went to the restroom and I just awaited alone until I could take the sample. I decided to wait for the result alone sitting in the floor, then I saw it I could not believe what was taking place. After 20 minutes I just went outside and shared the news with my boyfriend, and boy what a hit did a place on him. Well, putting apart this neccesary intro, the next months felt like a rush, sharing the news with our families, planning how to tackle our new life conditions and situation and going several times to the hospital between parenthood courses and doctor consultations. Everything was going great, until the last month I started to feel weird and everybody felt scared because we were close to the finish goal. I was taken to the hospital and in the hospital the doctor detected a trouble which at the moment I did not comment me quickly instead he went for the rest of the health team and was hospitalized due to an emergency. Everything happened quickly, and it was quickly told about the situation, they have small time to act to save the baby and I did not even think to give my answer, it was a firm yes. I was taken to the surgery room and the next day everything was great. After 4 months, my baby is healthy and I just found the need to write these events to have a registry. Life is unexpected but if you have faith it is a blessing."
