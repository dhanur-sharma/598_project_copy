        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was a warm summer morning. I was doing my morning chores and I was finishing up of the watering in the garden and backyard plants. I was felling a little low due to work being a little slow. I saw a hummingbird at the corner of my eye. It was darting in and out of the hose water stream. I lowered the pressure on the house to a fine mist. The hummingbird loved this. He/She darted in and out of the stream of water. It was no afraid of me, it liked the water. It took its fill by drinking and cooling off its shiny feathers on a hot summer morning. the humming bird took to flight after it has its fill. I felt closer to nature that morning. I felt that humans and animals can work together and help each other out. It was a good morning. I still thing about my brief time being close with a hummingbird."
