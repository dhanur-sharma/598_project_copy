        "Summarize the following story in first person: About three months ago, my boss allowed me to leave early from work. There was a major storm on its way and I wanted to get home before it hit. Unfortunately, I was not successful. Amid torrential rainfall, I ended up getting stranded at a gas station as the worst of the storm made its way through town. But the funny this is, the worst of it never really passed. It just hung above my head. I didn't want to spend the rest of my day at the gas station. I wanted to head home. Despite fearing greatly for my personal safety, I decided to chance it. I drove through the flooded streets. I was doing OK, perhaps just a couple of minutes away from home, when the visibility dropped to nothing. The rain was coming down so hard that I couldn't even see through my windshield. Eventually, my car stopped and, unexpectedly, caught fire. I grabbed my phone to call 911 only to notice that I had no signal. I got out and went to the graveyard to look for cover. Luckily, I found a porch and something unexpected - my friend, Carl. He was spending the day visiting his grandmother's burial plot when the storm hit. We struck up a conversation, and he handed me his phone so I could call someone about my broken down, burning car. At that point, it seemed like everything was going to be fine."

The storm had been so bad that it caused the gas pumps to ignite, and the fire spread to my car. Luckily, Carl and I were not injured. We were able to escape and run to safety. The storm eventually passed, but not before it destroyed much of the town. I was stranded for hours and witnessed a lot of destruction. I was lucky to have made it home and even luckier to have such a great friend like Carl who was there for me when I needed him the most.\n\n"
