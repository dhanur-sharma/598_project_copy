        "Summarize the following story in first person: It has been quite an active past 2 weeks.   First, I was named to be among the most successful students in my class!  I ran into and old friend from childhood that I haven't seen in 2 years and my brother who has been missing for 6 months finally came home and was knocking at the door!   This of course was the most shocking event of the past 2 weeks.  When I heard a knock at the door one afternoon after school I pretty much opened the door without even so much as looking to see who it was, which was my habit.  You can imagine my shock and surprise to see my brother that no one has seen in 6 months, and thought the worst, standing there before me!  It took a few seconds before I was able to scream out, you're back!  Thinking back now, my brother wasn't even the least bit excited to see me or to be home for that matter. It was almost as if he just went out for a few minutes and was back being greeted by a hysterical brother. He finally walks inside and I am still at the door holding it open when I hear another excited scream come from a distant part of the house.  It was my poor mother  who has been besides herself with worry these past couple of months. I slowly close the door and walk back inside to find my mother and brother.   My mother is asking rapid fire questions to my mostly emotionless brother who seemed to look like maybe this was a bad idea.  Where had he been, what was he doing and why had he not contacted any of us in all that time? The more I thought about this, the more agitated I started to become. And here he was now acting cold and rude towards us."

My brother just shrugs and says, \" I'm home now, can we just drop it\".   I am so angry and hurt that I storm out of the room and slam the door.  I can hear my brother and mother still talking but I don't care to hear anymore. I am still in shock and can't believe that he would just come back after all this time without even a phone call or letter.  I am still trying to wrap my head around everything that has happened in the past 2 weeks.   Being named a top student, seeing an old friend after so long and having my brother return after being missing for so long has left me feeling overwhelmed.  But I am happy to have my brother back, no matter how he is acting."
