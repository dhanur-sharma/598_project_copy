        "Summarize the following story in first person: Yesterday I had to take my kitty to the vet. I had to drive an hour over very rural back roads to get him there. He is quite a large cat and did not take to traveling well. I had to take him to the vet because he had been coughing and refusing to eat his prescribed kitty food. He was just having a hard time of it. I finally got him to the vet and he was able to get out of the car. I should say that he cried the whole time we were driving. I had to turn the music up to drown him out. I dont want to be mean, but he was really crying. Finally we got him to the vet and he calmed down a little. He got his urine checked and is having problems with allergies. The cat might have asthma. The cat!! I could not believe a cat could have asthma. Anyway, $100 later and we were on our way back home. The ride back was better."
