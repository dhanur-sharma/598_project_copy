        "Summarize the following story in first person: For the last year or so, my longtime partner and I were very close friends  with Julie, a coworker of my fiance. All three of us quickly became best friends, and saw each other at least once a week. Julie would sometimes come over to our home in the afternoon, stay the night, and then leave in the morning. After a while, our relationship with Julie felt like a partnership; almost like having a second girlfriend. I was confused by this, because I think I began to develop feelings for Julie. Some of these feelings were protective, like an older brother, and others were sexual in nature. This was made more confusing by my fiance's similar interests in Julie, and of course Julie's feelings towards us. When Julie went out of town, we offered to house sit for her. Julie was going to be gone for 14 days, so we agreed to stay at her home for that long. While she was gone, Julie ignored questions about her return times, and we had no idea when she would return. Eventually she responded, and asked that we stay in her home for another day while she ran errands. I had plans on that day, and Julie would be back home, so we couldn't stay at her home. I responded 'I truly can't to the request, and thought that would be adequate. When Julie came back home, I asked her to come back to her house, and we got into a huge fight. The three of us screamed at each other about who's responsibility it was to watch her home for the fifteenth day. Things did not end well. Over the next several weeks, Julie did not contact us, and both my fiance and I were upset. She had been a close friend, and now she was gone. It was truly like a breakup. It has now been three months, and while we have seen Julie once since then, things are not the same and I am still sad."
