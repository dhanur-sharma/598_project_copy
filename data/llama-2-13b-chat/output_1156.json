        "Summarize the following story in first person: An unexpected journey of heart break. I was in a 5 year relationship with a woman who lived in another country. When we decided to be together, I remember like it was yesterday. Getting my passport, and buying the plane ticket seemed small in the entire thing. What was really the big deal was getting on an airplane for the very first time. Being afraid of flying made this hard enough, but the excitement of going to another country on the other side of the world to meet the woman I loved overcame all of it. Her and I made plans to meet up at the airport when I arrived, and what we where going to do. When I got there, departed the plane, went through immigration,  and got my belongings she was no where to be seen. I waited for several hours outside the airport, trying to call her phone. When she finally answered, she told me she could not come to the airport. She asked me to just get a hotel and she would see me the next day. I was left in a foreign country alone I had no idea about, holding flowers and chocolates I brought for her. Looking foolish, I then decided to just get a taxi to a nice hotel for the night to relax from the jet lag, and decide what to do from there.  The next morning, she called me. She said she could not meet me that day either, maybe the next day she could. Her family called me, randomly, and said out of respect for me going all the way there they felt it was the right thing to do to tell me my girlfriend of 5 years had another boyfriend, and was pregnant. That she had been scamming me the entire time."
