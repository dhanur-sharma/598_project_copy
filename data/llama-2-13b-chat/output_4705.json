        "Summarize the following story in first person: My diary is about the day my neighbor gave birth. It was such I day I can never forget. I was in my apartment reading a novel when I heard a scream from close by. I could recognize the voice and the first time I heard it and concluded it was my neighbor. I rushed down to her apartment. I got there and the door was locked. She kept screaming and I realized her husband was not in the house and she was all alone. I had no choice but to break down the door and help her to the car. I immediately contacted the ambulance and decided to drive to the hospital because an ambulance may not be able to make it on time. I instantly get in the car and started driving. We were just few minutes to the hospital when she could not hold the pain no more and started screaming louder. Then I realized she was close to delivering. I instantly pulled over and contacted the ambulance. Fortunately, I passerby that tried to help happened to be a nurse. She helped with the delivery and she gave birth without any problem. It was such a great experience for me and I was glad I could help."
