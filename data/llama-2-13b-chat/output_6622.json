        "Summarize the following story in first person: I got to experience my son's first broken limb.  It happened while he was at my mother's house.  She watches him during the week, while I work, and I remember picking him up and her casually mentioning, I think he hurt his arm, he cried about it but seems okay, but you might want to keep an eye on it.  Of course it was a Friday night, and I had a friend coming over for the weekend, and she brought her young daughter with her so that her and my son could play.  My son seemed to be in pretty good spirits.  He was so happy to have a friend sleep over, and all was well until about bed time when the two tots ran into each and my son burst into tears.  He was so sad, and I wasn't sure what to do since it was so late at night.  I decided to go ahead and put him to bed with his paci and a bag of ice on his arm and I researched urgent cares that I could take him to in the morning.  We all got up the next morning, and my son was again in good spirits but he wasn't using his arm at all.  It just laid by his side like a wet noodle.  We got to urgent care right when it opened, went through all the paperwork and waited for what seemed like forever, then we went into the scary x-ray room where the nurses had to distract my toddler son so that he wouldn't be scared.  They pretended the machine had a bird in it and they asked him to look for him while they took his x-rays and then they gave him a sticker for his bravery.  When the doctor came in she was all seriousness.  She questioned my version of events and I felt like I was being interrogated.  Then she broke the news that the arm was broken, and that she would have to manually set it back into place.  And she did not sugar coat that the whole experience was really going to hurt.  So I braced myself as best I could, and was so thankful that my toddler was not paying attention to anything that she said.  She set his arm, and he did indeed cry about it, but then they bandaged his arm with a colorful splint and he was all smiles again.  They also gave him a ridiculously large children's shirt to wear, since I couldn't get his arm through the shirt we came in.  It was a scary experience, but I was happy with how well my son did throughout the whole experience."
