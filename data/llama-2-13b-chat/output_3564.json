This was five months ago and wow! It's been quite a ride!  I have never lived this far away from my family so it's been scary and hard not having them here to support me.  I miss my mom so badly  and I miss my friends.  At my age I didn't realize how much I still needed my m'om!  I'm making new friends here but I still spend more time alone than I want.    I think I might get a cat from the shelter to keep me company, i spend so much time at the office that I don't have a ton of time alone. It's mainly on weekends when I would be out with friends or having dinner with my parents. I love my new job even though it's so fast paced. I feel like I'm making an impact already. I got a nice raise with the promotion and am able to save money at a pace I never thought I could. I should be able to move from my apartment into a house within the next two years.  I'm glad I took the promotion even though it required that I move.  And I am flirting with my cute neighbor and think he's going to ask me out.."
