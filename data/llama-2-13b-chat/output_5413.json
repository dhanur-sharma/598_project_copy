        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was a cold and stormy night. I went outside and saw a cat in the distance. I got excited because I love animals so I called it over. The cat was scared but came over to me, hiding behind my car in the driveway.  I decided to feed the cat. I ran inside to get some food for the cat which my partner found for me. I got the cat to close closer and closer by moving the plate closer every time. The cat ran off and hid but came back for the food every time. Finally I sat there patiently with the door open and the cat came in. I moved the plate all the way inside my house and the cat went into the middle of my living room. The cat was scared away again by noise inside the house. I left the door open making myself sick waiting within the dusty wind storm. The cat came in again, maybe both trusting me and also desperate to escape the conditions outside. The cat came deep into the house. I closed the door behind the cat and eventually this cat would come to call my home the same."
