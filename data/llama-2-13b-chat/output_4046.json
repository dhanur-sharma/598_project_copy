        "Summarize the following story in first person: At this point this incident happened around twelve months ago. It was the first time in my life that I had ever suffered any kind of major injury before. I was at home and walked from the living room into the kitchen to go and get a glass of water. I tripped on the tile floor and fell. I ended up hitting my head really badly. Apparently there was a decent amount of blood and I was knocked out cold for a few minutes. Luckily, my parents were home at the time and called 911. I was taken to the hospital via ambulance. When I came to my parents and other family members were there. Luckily, I ended up being fine outside of just being a bit out of out and being really lightheaded. I did not have any broken bones or a concussion or anything like that. I did have to stay in the hospital overnight, just to make sure that everything was okay. I ended up going home the next morning. It took me about two weeks to recover in terms of not feeling lightheaded and to take all the pills I was given for the pain. I also had some short terms memory issues for a bit but those subsided in that time frame also. Nowadays I am a bit more cautious when it comes to walking on hard floors."
