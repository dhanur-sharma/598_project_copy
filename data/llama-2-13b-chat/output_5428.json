        "Summarize the following story in first person: Yes. I'll never forget that. It was Gus , we had to put asleep. He was with us for 11 years and he was our biggest  friend. He was a Yellow Lab (male). He never had problems with his health , but we knew, someday, it would be his last day. That day came in Jan. 2 2019.(Exact 1 year ago). My wife went down and found him in the corner of the room. He wasw lying on his side and alive with his brown eyes wide open. He had pooped on the floor and also threw up. He seemed to be in no pain, but he could,nt get up. We brought him some water and he drank some. After calling tyhe vet, we had to put him into the car. That was very dfficult, because he could not move and he was heavy (105 lbs). We manged to put him in the car with a blanket and we drove to the vet. With some help, we took him inside. The vet checked him and looked troubled. He hardly had bloodpressure. He is in a shock. There wasa a possibility , to find out, what happened top him,but that was very expensive. ($4000),and the chance , there was nothing serious wrong was zero. So we decided to let him sleep. The vet gave him the shot, and we said goodbeye to him. We all cried. It was so hard. We still miss him. Now this statement below tells me , I have only typed 8 sentences. But when I count, there are more than 20. Hoiw is this possible? In the meantime, I typed 4 more and still have only 8.What do I have to do to make 15 sentences? One more. One more. Two more? Three more./Four more? Five more. Six more. Seven more."
