        "Summarize the following story in first person: The date was July 29th, 2019. It\u2019s officially my due date! A few days ago, I went to the hospital with horrible contractions. They sent me home because I was only 1cm dilated. I\u2019ve been in so much pain, I haven\u2019t slept for around 48 hours. It hurt to sit, hurt to lay down, I\u2019ve basically been standing up on my feet for 2 days. I haven\u2019t eaten either. My bladder was irritated and just stopped working. I couldn\u2019t pee no matter how hard I tried. I was truly the most miserable I\u2019ve ever been. I finally couldn\u2019t stand it anymore so my mom and boyfriend took me back to the hospital and I FINALLY got admitted!! :D I guess all those crazy contractions worked because I finally dilated to 3cm and they admitted me! (After threatening their lives if they didn\u2019t lol) so here I am, on my due date, CRAZY happy with my epidural, and waiting to progress. Right now I\u2019m about 5-6cm. Can\u2019t wait to meet my little boy! UPDATE: My son was born 7/29 at 2:49am. 5 lbs 9oz We\u2019re in post partum recovery, I ended up having a c-section due to meconium in his amniotic fluid. He is perfect, healthy, and we\u2019re learning breastfeeding together. He\u2019s my angel."
