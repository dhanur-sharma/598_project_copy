        "Summarize the following story in first person: There are many events in life that serve as kinds of life changing moments. These times alter the way we perceive things and even test us. One of the most prominent examples for me is my miscarriage. My husband and I had been trying unsuccessfully to conceive for a year. We even consulted with professionals who were soon able to help us conceive. We were both ecstatic! We finally turned that spare bedroom we had been using as an office into our future child's room. We thought about possible names. We settled on Dana if it was a girl and Dale if it was a boy. We realized it was quite early on, but the excitement just overtook us. This excitement would soon change to a different feeling. I was at work one afternoon about two weeks after we found out and felt sick. I was very worried, but it passed and I thought nothing of it. About one week later, the unthinkable. I went in for a routine exam with my doctor who gave us the shock of our lives. Our sweet baby's heart had stopped beating. I was devastated and in disbelief. I refused to acknowledge the news. Reality set in three weeks later when I miscarried. My doctor suggested I write my thoughts in a journal as therapy, but the emotional pain is still there."
