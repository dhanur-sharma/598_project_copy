        "Summarize the following story in first person: \"I attended college an hour and a half from home, and a few times during the semester my dad would pick me up on Fridays so I could come home and visit for the weekend. We were on the interstate driving home, when my dad starts to tell me a story about a time when he was in the Army. I forget the precise details, but it was basically about how he and some buddies went out on the town one evening and had a few drinks. ... The tale becomes a bit more serious and personal all of the sudden  like he's pouring his heart out to me. My dad then says that he and his friends ran into another group of guys and got into an argument. The fight supposedly turned physical, with my dad throwing some punches at one of these guys. Then my dad, in the most serious tone possible, tells me that he grabbed the guy and pushed him off a cliff. The guy died and my dad and his friends managed to cover up the whole sordid tale from the police \u2014 this was the first time he'd ever admitted it to another living soul outside of that night. At this point, I'm horrified. Is my dad just confessing a murder to me? Was this mild-mannered man radically different when he was a 20-year-old kid? Do I tell my mom? Do I tell the police? Do I ask him to stop the car? Finally something in the story actually sunk in the part about 'pushing him off a cliff.' My dad was stationed in Louisiana when he was in the military and while I'd never been there, I was pretty sure there weren't that many cliffs. I finally said, ''Wait a minute, a cliff?' I'd been avoiding even looking at him since he made his 'confession,' but now that I looked over, he was about ready to explode. No longer able to hold it, he started laughing hysterically and kept saying, 'I can't believe you fell for it! You thought I killed a guy! April Fool's."
