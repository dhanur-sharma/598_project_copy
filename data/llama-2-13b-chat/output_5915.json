        "Summarize the following story in first person: Over the 4th of July week, I took a much needed vacation with family to one of my favorite destinations in the mountains of North Carolina.  I joined family at a campground that was part of the National Forest system. The campground was very busy for the forth of July. While in the mountains, we were able to do a lot of sightseeing and adventure traveling on the back roads of the National forest. Exploring forest roads is one of my favorite activities.  We were a also able to ride many mile on the Blue Ridge Parkway which provided many awesome scenic views. Some of the views are the best in the country in my opinion. We also were able to do some gem hunting in some of the local creeks which was a blast. The mountain creeks are filled with garnets and rubies. I found several small garnets to take back home with me as souvenirs.  We all had a very enjoyable time playing around in the creeks. The food options in the mountains were unbelievable. Our appetite was taken care of by the likes of BBQ and fresh trout among other things. We have decided that we will return to eat the trout again in the future. We also had grilled hotdogs one night around the campfire which was really nice and relaxing. All in all, this was one of my favorite vacations ever and I can't wait to go back."
