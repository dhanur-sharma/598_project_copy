        "Summarize the following story in first person: My grandmother was a robust village lady. For almost all her life, she stayed in the village, but she came to stay with us in the city only when we were in our teenage years as my parents who had to travel abroad because my father was an active duty British Army stationed in Hong Kong.  So those teenage years were the most precious years for me, something I more often remember.  It reminds me of how graceful my grandmother was. A village lady yet she was very disciplined, graceful and was an excellent guardian for me and my three sisters.  She was always careful enough to tend to us and put us in the first place and never complained about anything she wanted or she never got.  She taught us our family roots, the histories, the hardship of village life, her own hard life of having to get married in a young age and how she had to learn everything on her own.  She taught us about the important life lessons about Buddhism and to be humble, kind, truthful and the importance of family, the support.  She was a robust lady who never stepped foot in a hospital or taken any medication the whole life.  I still get the visual of her in her traditional attire, smiling back to us, her toothless smile and dimple on her cheeks.  But in life, there comes that unfortunate time in everyone's life that an accident happens and everything changes.  One sad rainy day, she simply was walking but somehow lost balance on a slippery road and fell and struck her head.  We rushed to her seeing her fall.  She got up and tried to convince her everything is okay, but we insisted her to go to a hospital for just a checkup.  We went to the hospital and did some x-rays and found out a hematoma was formed in her brain.  The first few days, she was alright but the following week, she started showing signs of forgetfulness and she started losing her memory.  Once back to the hospital, we found out, blood flooded in her brain and needed an immediate surgery.  She underwent that and once back, she was okay for a couple of days. Then again, she had the same symptoms.  Once again, we took her to the hospital and the doctor told us because of her age, she cannot be operated and told us to make her comfortable as long as she lives.  Two months after that incident, that morning, she said she was having a headache and felt tired and wanted to go to sleep.  That day, she slept like a baby and the next morning, when I went to wake her up for her morning tea, I said to her to wake up, but she didn't budge and when I touched her, she had passed away.  She passed away at the age of 86.  Even though I was sad, I was happy for her knowing that she no longer is in pain and now, wherever she is, I hope she is peace and hopefully looking at us.  She is in our hearts, that lovely robust village lady with a cheeky smile, hugging us from inside out."
