        "Summarize the following story in first person: I can't help but find myself thinking about Anthony all the time. It has already been six months since we broke up and I can't change my mind on the reason why I wanted to break up, but I also can't help but miss him and think about him all the time. I really felt betrayed when he told me that he had contracted an STD. I was scared for my own health and angry at him because I know that he did not get the STD from me. He was honest with me about cheating on the ski trip and I believe that he truly was remorseful. I wish that i could find it in my heart to forgive that and continue a relationship with him. I can't find anyway to see that as tolerable and it continues to be a line crossed that I cannot move past. I feel like he still wanted to be with me and that he respected my wishes and understood my hurt in allowing our relationship to end. I wish that he would have fought for me but it makes me feel that he truly did care for me that he respected how I feel. I keep comparing any new potential relationships to him and there is always something that makes me hesitant. This guy is too tall, that guy is too skinny, this one isn't smart enough, that one is too cocky, but in reality every excuse should be that they are not Anthony. It is frustrating for me that I find myself in a situation where I want something that I will not allow myself to have. Truly does feel like a fight between my heart and my mind. I know that I will ALWAYS suspect him of cheating again and that I can never fully trust him like I did before he cheated. That inability to trust is just a red flag that I can find no way of getting around."
