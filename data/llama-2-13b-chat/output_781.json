        "Summarize the following story in first person: One week ago today, I gave birth to a healthy baby girl! We have named her Kia Jane. I never knew I could love another being this much! All it took was one look at her and I knew that my life had forever changed. Kia is perfect in every single way I could imagine. I ended up having to be induced because my water broke while I was cooking dinner on the stove, but no contractions at all. The doctors were worried that I could get an infection so they decided it was best not to wait for her to come on his own. I was really nervous about this, it's absolutely not what I had in my birth plan. Then again, when does life ever go as planned? I hate to admit, but I did ask for pain medication and honestly I am so glad I did. She really didn't want to come out so they had to use a vacuum assist for her to finally be born. I was worried her little head would look like a cone but it looks just fine!! I got to hold her right after she came out and it was love at first sight!!! I think my birth journey says something about this little girls personality, she is stubborn just like her daddy! Speaking of Dad, he has been so helpful getting up with her in the middle or the night. Hard to believe but he is even changing diapers!  I cant wait to watch each milestone! My mom says to enjoy every minute of this because before I know it she will be all grown up. She is right I know!"
