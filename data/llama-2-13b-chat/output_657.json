        "Summarize the following story in first person: One morning, out of the blue, I received an unexpected text messagefrom a friend whom I had not talked to in almost two years. We hadpreviously been friends and would meet up for movies, meals, and otheractivities before we had a falling apart. I had helped him through avery difficult period in his life when he experienced the loss of twoclose family members. I was glad to be there for him, but personalitydifferences created tensions that eventually came to a head aroundlate 2017, when we had a bit of a fight and stopped speaking to oneanother. I was regretful of some of the things I'd said during thefight and tried to make amends, but he was not interested. At the time he texted me, I had pretty much just written off thefriendship and assumed we would never speak again. I had thought ofnot replying, due to the bad experience of the past interactions. However, I was concerned that something may have gone wrong for him tocontact me, of all people, and replied. He had contacted me to inviteme to his wedding, which would happen in a few weeks. I was verysurprised, and told him I would definitely consider going, though itwas short notice. I couldn't decide whether to go to the wedding or not for the next fewweeks. I didn't know if it would be a good idea based on how badlythings had gone in the past. I eventually decided to go, just out ofcuriosity to see what happened. I'm glad I went. The wedding was avery nice ceremony, and I got to meet some very nice people there. Ihad a brief chat with my estranged friend, and things seemed to begoing much better for him. I was happy for him, and got to meet hiswife, who was very nice. The food and reception were very nice, and Ileft feeling like we were on good terms again. I think it was nice toget a second chance to repair the friendship that I'd previously givenup on."
