        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last month my neighbor decided to park between his garage and my house on part of my lawn. His truck is huge and completely blocks my window. The only window that I have that is able to be opened. My cat tree sits in front of it. The cats look out it and look a birds or other things going on there. When I asked him about parking there he kind of shrugged it off and let me know he had no intention of not parking there anymore. So I made a decision to go buy a birdbath and put it in front of that window on my area of property. I purchased the birdbath. It was huge. Weighed about 100lbs. I killed my back lifting it into the cart. I hurt my back so badly I could not get it out of the cart and into my car. I had to have someone from the store do it for me. I asked my neighbor to please move his truck sometime that week so that I could install the birdbath. He got furious, started going off about property lines and blah blah blah.  I remained calmed and I showed him the property line and said nicely, didnt mean to upset you, I just want to install a birdbath on my property in front of my cat window. So with the help of my roommates walker with a seat on it, I was able to move the heavy birdbath from car to where I was putting it in. I was suprised at how smoothly that went. I now have a nice birdbath, and no huge monsterous truck blocking my window, the birds have water and my cats have more things to watch."
