        "Summarize the following story in first person: Oh my God! You will not believe what happened for my birthday a few months ago! I am still in complete and utter shock! My husband actually planned a whole dinner and movie birthday date night, and to my surprise, all of my friends and coworkers were there! Not to mention, my best friend from high school had even made it to surprise me! This was literally the best thing I could have asked for. I still cannot believe he was able to pull this off without me finding out. It was amazing and I had the best time ever. He actually forgot my birthday the year before, so the fact the he went above and beyond this year was really important to me. I would have really got it if he didn't do it right this time. But I am relieved to say the least! I just am so excited to see what is in store for next year now. I mean how could he top that? My best friend from High School, who I haven't seen in years! He had her flown in all the way from across the United States to spend the birthday weekend with us! How amazing is he? I am still in shock that he was able to complete all of this under my nose. He is a real trickster and he has won husband of the year!"
