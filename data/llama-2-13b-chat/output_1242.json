        "Summarize the following story in first person: While I was living with my boyfriend, I got nostalgic, thinking about the times that I had with my family and friends. At first, everything was going well and we were living happily ever after. I found it exhilarating to be out and away from my familiar surroundings, as I would have to rely on my boyfriend to figure out how to get around. I soon noticed things about my boyfriend, as I have phases where I think very critically of people. More often, though, I have many phases where I see things that attracted me to this person. But, while thinking critically of my boyfriend, I noticed that he has certain moments where he gets very relaxed, during these phases, he takes things for granted. He is ok with laying on the ground to do repair work and sometimes urinate out in the open and he doesn't mind my seeing his private parts. He sees himself as a handyman and he doesn't like a lot of critical thinking that is required to solve problems related to mathematics and the physical sciences. He tends to or appears to get envious of me, when I want to talk about solving problems, so, when it comes up, he likes to switch topics. Over time, he either wanted to dominate conversations or not have talks at all. He likes to order me around, probably not fully realizing what he's doing, and, I have to depend on him for transportation. I would need to rely on him to get me back to my past living location, where I'm familiar with the area and have family and friends. When a confluence of things came together, I realized that I wanted to get back to familiar surroundings and around my family and friends. But, my concern about how he would feel about such a request made me hesitate to tell him that I'd prefer to be getting back around my friends and family soon. But, my critical mind kept me thinking about these features that he seems to have more and more, as time went on. So, out of mounting frustration, I came on him light and hinted that I would rather return some place to be much closer to family and friends. When first mentioned to him, he brushed it off, so, soon, I became more assertive, as required. So, one time, I was very abrasive and direct with him. He became sad, after being surprised that I really meant what I was saying. Thus, when he finally agreed to bring me back around family, friends, and familiar surrounds, things were such a relief for me, even considering his surprised and sad demeanor. I was so relieved, when I got back, in all honesty. But, after having a few days and weeks to consider our parting day, I started to become more and more considerate of his feelings. So, I started to communicate with him again, after some weeks and he was nice, relieved, and happy to be hearing from me again. I thought about the qualities that I liked about him and I wanted to ease back into a close nit with him, but, I would also still need some distance to be with my familiar surroundings. Things would have to grow on me and I would need to adapt."
