        "Summarize the following story in first person: a few weeks ago my poor dog bear was so sick.  I did not know what was wrong with him.  I called into work to tell them I had an emergency and would be out for the day.  I rushed bear to the vet.  I was so scared he is like my third child and I could not stand it if something happened to him.  When we got to the vet they took him right in.  I was so nervous but the vet was calm so I tried to be as well.  They gave me several meds for him.  The vet did not know what caused the episode so that has me worried.  It could happen again if I do not change whatever caused it in the first place.  I felt unsettled because I did not know if it was something he ate or if he was allergic to something.  What if the next time it is even worse?  I did not know where to even start to try and find out the cause.  I decided to take him back to the vet in a couple of days for a recheck and to talk to the vet in depth about steps I can take to make sure he stays well.  I hope the vet does not think I worry too much."
