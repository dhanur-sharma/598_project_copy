        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was one incredibly stormy night, rare in the desert of Nevada where I live, all day it was overcast, it rained and it had also been extremely windy. I noted several times throughout the day how windy it was, how uncomfortable it was to be outside. I complained every time I went outside to have a cigarette how the weather was so nasty. I went out to have another cigarette and I saw the silhouette of a creature walking by. Seeing it excited me, as I recognized it was a cat. Naturally as an animal lover I crouched down and made click-y sounds as I asked the cat to come to me. \"You're okay, come here!\" I persisted this way for awhile. The cat, surprisingly, came over to me right away without getting too close. My partner then found canned chicken breast meat for me which I took back outside and put on a plate. I backed away and let the cat approach the food. It recognized it as food instantly and came forward. I eagerly approached the cat while it was eating and caused it to bolt. I was disappointed, having scared away the cat while it was eating. I decided to go back inside hoping the cat would return. Peaking through the blinds I saw a shadowy figure next to the plate of food. The cat had returned to eat. I refilled the food and went back inside, where I watched through the blinds.  Every time I opened to door to check the cat would run and hide under the car in the driveway, but it was clearly starved so I began to slowly move the plate closer to the front door, eventually moving it just inside the house and leaving the front door opened. I sat there waiting and the cat came to the door. It was such a small and skinny kitten. I convinced the cat to come in. A sound from inside the house that scared the cat away again. I repeated this process for several hours. My partner thought I had lost my mind and was imagining a cat being there with me until she saw it herself but finally the cat was in the house again, going for yet another plate of food. I closed the door and decided that we now have a cat."
