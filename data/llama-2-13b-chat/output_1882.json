        "Summarize the following story in first person: My daughter was born on December 4th.  It was a planned c-section after a high risk pregnancy.  I was very excited to meet my new little girl but it was bittersweet.  This was my last pregnancy and although I was a tough one, I already knew I was going to miss the little details of carrying a child.  The small flutters that reminded you of the sweet baby in your belly, the wonder of seeing their kicks and movements, and the little gestures of kindness that are reserved for pregnant women were all things that I would never experience again.  I was also scared for the procedure.  With my first child, I had an emergency c-section so I didn't have time to stress about the whole surgery.  This time was different.  I worried about the things that could go wrong,  I didn't have the same confidence in my medical team that I had had with my first child.  I think my biggest concern was how my son was going to handle having a baby sister.  He was barely two.  I didn't know if he was going to be upset.  I was worried that he wouldn't feel loved and wanted.  When my husband brought him to my hospital room, I wanted him to feel just as important as he always had.  My son looked a bit alarmed at all the hospital equipment.   My husband brought him over to see the baby and he showed a bit of interest.  He stroked her hair and said \"baby\". That's when he leaned over to kiss the  baby on her head.  The whole room sighed at the cuteness of it.  Until the baby started screaming, that is.  Apparently, he was not as taken with his new little sister as we had hoped.  She had two tiny red marks on her forehead from where he bit her.  I had expected him to be unsure of the new baby but I never expected him to do that.  He then asked us to \"take her back, please\".  I think that was the beginning of a lifelong sibling rivalry."

She loves her big brother but she also likes to boss him around.  I look back on that day and laugh at how worried I was.  I know now that my son was just trying to assert himself and show his dominance.  But at the time, it was a bit of a shock.  Overall, it was a bittersweet day.  I was so happy to meet my new little girl but I was also sad that my pregnancy was over and I would never experience that again.  I was scared about the future and how my children would get along but in the end, everything turned out okay.  My daughter is thriving and my son is adjusting to having a little sister.  I'm so grateful for my beautiful babies and the love they bring to my life."
