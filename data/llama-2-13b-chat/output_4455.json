        "Summarize the following story in first person: While we were down at the beach, we decided to take them to a nearby aquarium.  We did not have a car and the aquarium was about a twenty minute drive from the resort.  We looked into options and decided that we would Uber.  I had never used the service before so I was a bit nervous.  I downloaded the app and order the ride.  When it showed up to the resort, my family and I hopped in.  I began to engage in a bit of small talk with our driver.  It turned out that he was from the same state that we were from, Massachusetts.  So here we are in South Carolina and our driver was from the same state.  It was a crazy coincidence.  After continuing our talks it turned out we lived in communities that were about half and hour apart.  We shared some stories about back home, and he gave us some great recommendations.  Him and his wife had retired down there a couple years back so they knew the place well.  For my first Uber experience it was a good one and one that I will not forget.  The one back to the resort was not as entertaining or surprising to say the least.  I wonder if that will ever happen to me again."
