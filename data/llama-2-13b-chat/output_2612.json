        "Summarize the following story in first person: So I've been thinking of becoming a dive master for a long time.  I remember the first time I went diving as a child.  It was one of the best days.  My dad took me out diving and it was so incredible.   We had so many great Saturday afternoons spent on the water.  As I grew older and started to go to different places I met other dive masters.  I did't realize that people could get paid to go diving.  It was pretty cool to think that maybe I could do that for a job.  I put off getting my certifications because it's expensive.  It's also kind of scary to think that I will be responsible for other's peoples lives.  But the truth is that anytime you are diving you are responsible to help out the people that are around you.  I really think that now is the right time in my life to pursue this.  I've looked around at some different schools and I've picked the one that is going to be right for me.  It looks like the program is going to take awhile to finish, but that's ok.  I can probably pick up a parttime job in the dive shop while I'm working through all the certifications."
