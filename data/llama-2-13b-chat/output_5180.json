        "Summarize the following story in first person: I felt vulnerable and angry. That's when I decided to extract my own revenge. I knew they'd come back. I asked a friend to stay at my home while I spent the next morning at a local hardware store. There, I gathered a carefully-researched bundle of goods that would ensure that anyone else trying to enter my home would be sorry they did so. To protect myself, I won't specify the steps I took or the items I used. Rest assured that they were set up to be painful but not deadly. I spent the afternoon setting everything up. That evening, I made sure that my exit from my home was well-staged so that it could be seen by others in the area. I even returned only 10 minutes after leaving, looking nervous, making sure I was seen. After a few minutes, I left once again. While I was seen walking down the street towards the uptown area, I didn't go there. I went to my neighbor's home (I had a key) and planted myself by the window facing my home. Sure enough, one of the thugs showed up. It was glorious. Tomorrow, dear diary, I'll explain exactly what happened next."
