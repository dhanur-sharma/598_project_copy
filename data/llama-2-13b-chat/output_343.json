        "Summarize the following story in first person: My family, my sister's family, and my parents went on a trip to the Smoky Mountains. We went to DollyWood, SplashCountry, Hatfield and McCoys, Goats on the Roof, and several other local attractions. It was a wonderful family time. One of the most exciting parts of the trip was when my daughter was selected to go up on stage on the Hatfield and McCoys dinner show. She had so much fun getting to dance with everyone on the stage and we even bought the video to bring home so that she could always remember it. It was also my son and daughter's first time riding the coaster at Goats on the Roof. My daughter wasn't tall enough to ride by herself, so I had to ride with her this time. I cannot wait until she is able to do it all on her own, because my son loved it! It was one of his favorite things. My kids also loved our cabin. We had a huge cabin with enough room for my entire family to stay together. The kids loved that it had an indoor pool, hottub, game room, and a theater room! They still talk about their favorite rides at DollyWood. This was my daughter's first time riding a lot of bigger rides, so it took us a little while to talk her onto the roller coasters, but once she tried it she was hooked. Her favorite was the Fire Chaser and she has been begging to get to ride it again. My children enjoyed this trip and cannot wait to go back. We are actually considering going back next month and letting them see all of the lights at Dollywood."
