        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was Friday of last month. My best friend had his bachelor party. We decided to have a fairly tame night out at a popular local bar with all our closest friends in attendance. It was a very cool night out compared to the hot weather we had been having. When we got to the bar we all played several rounds of pool and ordered several rounds of bourbon.  We had a lot of fun just sharing stories and playing games. It was such a memorable night due to the simplicity of it. We rarely all get together like that anymore and the focus was on having a good time. We had a pretty large bill by the end of the night and were entirely too drunk. I had to call a cab to get us all back to his apartment. From there we ordered a pizza and fired up some old games.  We must have played until at least five in the morning when the last of us had finally dozed off. The next day we were up early for the weeding and we had to scatter back to our places to get ready.  The wedding was was outdoors at a local winery.  It was such a nice morning and it felt good to breathe in the fresh air. The ceremony was simple and everyone was elated. I remember the bride\u2019s slim yet long white dress and the rows of pristine white chairs. I was best man and was very nervous having to stand up in front of all those people I didn\u2019t know. My friend was so confident when he spoke of his love to her. I felt happy just to be there in that moment. After the ceremony the music started right away and we all began to enjoy the wine provided. My friend said I didn\u2019t have to give a speech but I decided it would be a good idea to say a few kind words and toast to the new marriage. It was a short nerve racking moment; however, it seemed to be received well We watched as they had their first dance and then hit the floor ourselves. It was kind of sad because I realized that he would have a lot less time for us at this point forward. They were moving to a new city and he would be starting a new job."
