        "Summarize the following story in first person: One week ago, my life changed. My late husband's daughter from the first marriage, walked into my life six years after his passing. She reached out to me on the Facebook and attached a photo of being held by her dad when she was little. Seeing my husband young and full of life brought tears to my eyes. It felt as if a part of him was still here, as if he reached out to me across some invisible distance. His daughter looks so much like him, especially her eyes. I began to wonder whether I would be able to refrain from being overly emotional if we actually met in real life because looking at her would remain me so much of my husband. I miss him dearly and I hope that this new relationship and connection with his daughter will bring me comfort and peace in knowing that some part of him still lives through her. Perhaps her reaching out to me was meant to be, a little gift of love that my husband sent from heaven to ease the pain of his loss. I'm happy that she will have the opportunity to meet our son, her half brother. They are not too far apart in age and both go to college, so maybe they will have some things in common. They also have similar faces since they both look so much like their father.  My husband kept a lot of things for the kids. He was a gifted writer and filled many notebooks with poems and short stories to pass along to his children. I definitely want them to see his writing and see how talented their dad was. Maybe even pass it along to their kids. I also have other mementos like photos and records that I know he would want them to have. One step at a time, however. Right now I'm looking forward to meeting his daughter at the airport next Friday. I invited her to fly out and stay with us over the weekend while my son will be visiting from college. We can all spend some time relaxing and getting to know each other better."
