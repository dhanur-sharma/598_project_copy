        "Summarize the following story in first person: I am currently 31 years old and pregnant with my first child. I have been dating my boyfriend for 3 years. We have a great relationship, he was my knight in shining armor after being in a abusive relationship for over a year prior we started dating. When i was 20 weeks pregnant we both found out that our baby has a 1% chance for survival, she was diagnosed with a genetic condition called Turner Syndrome. So one day he asked me out to dinner. So i agreed. We took the bus and got off near the pier where you could see the city. We start walking towards a really nice restaurant that was located on the water and we got really great seats near the window, so we could see the entire city lit up. I was telling my boyfriend that wow we got lucky to get such great seats. Dinner was nice, it was really great food. We had a great night. Great food. Great conversation. Great atmosphere. So when it was time to order dessert, we ordered the lava cake. I remember it was taking so long to come. So when it did come out i got the shock of my live. It said \"Will you marry me?\"  in chocolate around the plate. My boyfriend got up and walked over to me and got on one knee and proposed. I had no idea. I was completely shocked. The first thing i said was \"oh my gosh, go sit down\", then i said \"yes!\" and everything registered in my brain. It was a very great date that night. And now we are currently planning our wedding."
