        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last month I got into quite the scary car accident. I was driving my Ford Explorer down a windy road when a deer leapt out in front me. In an attempt to swerve around the deer, I jerked my steering wheel hard to the right towards a turn down a side street. However, the speed I was going at and the weight and unwieldiness of my car made me go careening off towards a house. With no real course of action at this point, luck had me slip directly in between two trees in this persons front yard, coming close enough to one to take off my side view mirror. Then a sharp ditch by their driveway slowed my vehicle enough to come to stop with little damage. Coming out of this, I had 3 of my 4 tires popped, a broken side view mirror, and a shattered window; but luckily no injuries myself. This has been on my mind nearly constantly since then, how differently it could have gone. I did lose my car, but I could have very easily lost my life. Or worse yet, I could have careened into that poor persons house and caused the death of someone else. After the accident the startled residents of the home came out to make sure I was ok. After sharing exasperated bewilderment at the luck of the scenario, I called a tow truck. The residents of the home were nice enough to offer me water and sit with me till the police and tow truck showed up. Luckily I have a bit of cash saved up for purchasing a new car, and hopefully my insurance premiums don't go up too much. Going forward its going to be hard to drive without the constant anxiety of another rogue deer deciding my fate. But I am very grateful that things didn't turn out worse."
