        "Summarize the following story in first person: My daughter and I took a trip to California.  She read online about the train going down to California.  It was highly romanticized but it did look nice.  We got a sleeper car and looked at the scenery.  It surprised me that the food was so good.  However, one of the really suprising thing was the people we met.  When they seat you at dinner they put you with strangers so there is a formality of introducing yourself and telling your travel story.  The stories were so interesting and my daughter and I could not stop talking about them.  In our divided country, meeting all these people from different areas of the country, politics was not mentioned once.  It was really amazing.  One person was nearly 94 but he appeared to be in his seventies.  One couple was from the phillipines.  One man was laid off and took a low end job and he admitted that his parents were supporting him.  There was such a raw emotional quality to the dinner stories that my daughter and i kept talking about them and how emotional it felt about our story.  Because with each story we heard, we had to tell the person our story.  We had to tell our hopes and dreams and failures and it became very raw and personal.  Previous to this trip, my daughter and I had been not very close.  This was making me a little sad because we used to be very close.  But through the rawness and honesty of the stories we heard, she began telling me things that she had been hiding from me.  What's more, she really wanted to know things that I don't tell her or tell my husband.  It was so suprising, because normally if you found out you had to eat dinner with a stranger, you would not be happy.  Yet through the stories of strangers I feel closer and more focused than ever.   When she was little we were so close.  However, as she became a teenager we have a more strained relationship.  But after this trip we are as close as ever."
