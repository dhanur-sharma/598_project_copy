        "Summarize the following story in first person: It's less of a single incident and more of an overarching theme for the past three months. My wife and I are transitioning in our careers and things are a little more chaotic than usual. Our stress levels are higher. It's harder to relax. In general, I'm more anxious than I usually am despite being on medication for depression and anxiety. I've started a job as a real estate agent which means I now work on commission. There are advertising fees and what not associated with being an agent that are required to find workable leads. Additionally, I live five hours away from the region that I cover. Commutes are long and I spend a lot of time traveling. I frequently find myself oscillating between happy and feelings of hopelessness. A lot of my anxiety comes from the money we have and the mortgage payments that we are required to make. That's part of the reason why I'm doing stuff on mturk. I need to fill my downtime with some type of revenue generating activity. As my bank account shrinks my anxiety grows. I know it's just a matter of time before I starting landing clients and generating some revenue. But, the waiting is hard. It's difficult being patient and having confidence in yourself when you don't have that regular paycheck to depend on."
