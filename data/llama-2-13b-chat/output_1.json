        "Summarize the following story in first person: The day started perfectly, with a great drive up to Denver for the show. Me and my boyfriend didn't hit any traffic on the way to Red Rocks, and the weather was beautiful. We met up with my friends at the show, near the top of the theater, and laid down a blanket. The opener came on, and we danced our butts off to the banjoes and mandolins that were playing on-stage. We were so happy to be there. That's when the sunset started. It was so beautiful. The sky was a pastel pink and was beautiful to watch. That's when Phil Lesh came on, and I just about died. It was the happiest moment of my life, seeing him after almost a decade of not seeing him. I was so happy to be there, with my friends and my love. There was nothing that could top that night. We drove home to a sky full of stars and stopped at an overlook to look up at them. I love this place I live. And I love live music. I was so happy."
