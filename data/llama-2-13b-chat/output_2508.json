        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was in a polyamarous relationship for nearly one year. I had another girl I was talking to that knew I was polyamarous. However, she had recently gone through a fair bit of trauma. So I wasn't pursuing things with her at the time. My girlfriend at the time was no longer coming around and I felt our relationship was near ended. I failed to try to address this and communicate with her. I started talking to a new girl a few days before my birthday, and we really clicked. Probably the strongest connection I've had with someone over just text messages in such a short amount of time. I was really feeling her. I told her when we first started talking that I was polyamarous and had other girls in my life. However once things got intense it became very clear that she was looking for a monogamous relationship. I wanted her so bad. My needs weren't being met by my girlfriend. The other girl, our conversations were good but, not nearly as intense. The night before my birthday I broke up with my girlfriend so that I could get to know the new girl. I broke my girlfriends heart. She cried. But she said she was proud of me for taking a risk and would be there for me. I also told the other girl what I had done and what I was pursuing. She immediately distanced herself from me and it seems I broke her heart too. I met the new girl a few days later and afterwards she stopped texting me completely and told me she wasn't interested. I threw away the two people who did love me for a stranger. I did it because I was lonely and I ended more alone than ever before."
