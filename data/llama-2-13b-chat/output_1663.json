        "Summarize the following story in first person: A couple weeks back a man in our church asked me to pressure wash a part of the church driveway. I told him i would do it after the chapel got tented. He got upset and asked me again to which i gave him the same response. I went back to my apartment to pray and use the bathroom and when i exited i found him talking with my coworker at the church. he sounded frustrated and then the lady asked him to open a door to the ceiling for the tenting and he exploded. He started yelling and then started looking for me to verbally attack me for not pressure washing the driveway according to his timetable. Like an idiot i tried to reason with him and told him if someone asks him to do something that he doesn't want to do to simply say no. Like a crazy person he said he couldn't say no to people. So now he is angry at me for his inability to say no and manage his life. he kept yelling and it got so bad that i asked him to leave, but he said he wasn't leaving and sat down in the chapel. Afterward i asked my coworker to join me in my apartment to speak privately. When we were alone I tried to explain to her that this man's behavior was unacceptable and that he had to be kicked out of the church. Unfortunately this woman was so deficient in judgement that she didn't see anything wrong with this man's behavior and tried to blame me for what had just transpired. She kept saying that i don't do anything for the church, which is not true. It made me very angry that she would say such nonsense after living and working at the church for a year and a half."
