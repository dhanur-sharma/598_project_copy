        "Summarize the following story in first person: About three months ago, I took a big leap of faith and moved in with my boyfriend of two years. This was a huge event in my life. I have been very hesitant about getting involved with someone new after my divorce in 2010, which was painful and financially devastating. My boyfriend, Mark, is different than anyone I have ever known. We are an older couple, me being 52 and him being 60. He's never lived with a girlfriend or been married. For me, I did not want to be involved with someone who would dominate my life, or try to control me. I've been alone for several years now and have come to appreciate my independence. Push came to shove for me last spring when Mark's mother, who he was a caretaker for, went into an assisted living facility. This left Mark alone and financially destititute. I made the leap of faith and moved in with him. I am now the breadwinner for our new family and he is looking for work. Its not always easy, but we are very happy and live a quiet life. We plan to get married this coming winter. There was a happy ending to this story."
