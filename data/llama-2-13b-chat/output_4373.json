        "Summarize the following story in first person: \"After an intense gym session, I felt a relieving pop followed by extreme pain. I had pulled my vastus medialis, the inner quad, and caused damage to my sartorius, the longest muscle in the body.\"The year was off to good start. My finances were up 30% and February was looking to be a fun month with a weekend getaway with my lady on my birthday.  It was about a week into February when I hit the legs pretty hard. I should have taken a short rest period that week but decided to go hard one more week. This, unfortunately, was a bad decision. After the intense gym session, my legs were tight. As I was leaving and getting into the car, I felt a relieving pop followed by extreme pain once I arrived at my destination. I kept thinking I was just tired, maybe worked it too hard, and then kept doing normal activity stuff that night. By the time I made it back to my house, I could barely walk or drive. When I stepped my foot outside the car to get out of the car, a sudden pop came from the inner part of my knee.  It was the worst feeling ever. I had to lay bed for at least 3 to 4 entire days and could barely even make it to the restroom. I had to have my lady come over and assist me to a bath. Then I was able to get her to get my crutches from the garage. I'm glad I kept those things! Finally I was mobile but far from walking. about 6-8 weeks go by while I'm beginning to master the crutches. I could even use on to push the gas pedal at times because driving was so difficult. Finally the crutches were not need anymore and started my long journey to recovery.  Everything was progressing and healing until I twisted my torso one day rolling over and pulled another muscle that overlaps the first one I tore at the gym. That set me back another 4-6 weeks. All in all, its been about 7 months and I'm still recovering but can function about 80% normal now. I'd say that's a hell of a significance from stuck in bed in excruciating pain. In another month's time I think I'll be able to get back on some hiking trails just in time to see the leaves fall and change color."
