        "Summarize the following story in first person: \"My Father-in-Law Has Cancer\"My father-in law in the first part of July 2019 went for his physical. His PSA was up. The doctor suspected cancer. July 19, 2019 the diagnosis was confirmed with biopsies. It was when that confirmation happened I became more than his daughter-in-law, I became his health and mental counselor. I had a been a caregiver to many people in my life through all kinds of illnesses. I also have been a cancer counselor. The first thing he asked me was if I could care for him if/when things got bad. I said of course. I think he reached out to me because of my background and because we are close. He is close with my husband but my husband does not have much experience with taking care of people. So my and his lives have changed. We have spent our days conversing over tests that have been done and tests that are yet to be done. We have spent our spare time reading all we can about prostate cancer and I even attended a group meeting at the local hospital to get answers and more reading material. The prognosis is not the best and we are having many dialogues about what treatments should be considered as first and second opinions are in conflict. This story is still unfolding both in real time and in my mind about what the future will hold for him, myself and my husband."
