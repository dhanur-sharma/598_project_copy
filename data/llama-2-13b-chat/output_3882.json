        "Summarize the following story in first person: Dear Diary,The events leading up to my eye problems have been stressful. I thought I was going in for a routine eye exam, but that was not the case. I knew I would develop cataracts at some point. I did not think that time was now. I so wanted to just get new glasses. However, my optometrist said I needed to go to a retina specialist before surgery could be approved. I made the appointment for the specialist. I am so nervous as to what he will find. All the patients at the office kept asking me what I was there for. It was a little strange to have strangers ask detailed questions. I mostly just listened to what they had wrong with their eyes. My exam involved getting my eyes dilated which I don't like. It doesn't hurt, but distorted vision is very unsettling. The doctor examined my eyes and did numerous tests. Some of the tests were painful. This doctor did not have a good bedside manner. He did clear me for surgery which was good. Now I will need to see a cataract specialist for the surgery. I am very nervous about having that surgery even though I know it is mostly commonplace these days."
