        "Summarize the following story in first person: I had been written up at work before in the past year.  It seemed like a similar issue that wasn't my fault was about to happen again.  I can't go into too many details with this, but the previous event cost the company revenue because of something I overlooked.  I was written up and was put on corrective action for three months.  This was something similar that happened, but through a loophole I escaped scott free.  A process change was implemented in the process.  I was getting anxious as this meeting went on that I was not a part of, but my supervisor kept me in the loop over instant messenger.  I was told of what's going on and that I'm not in trouble due to me being instructed how to perform the process.  I ended up deciding to speak to my primary care doctor about going on anti-anxiety medication.  The anxiety that previously caused my ill feelings was  subsided because of the medication.  I was told I looked more relaxed at work and not as tense.  I'm feeling much better now and hope to move forward.  I'm no longer dwelling on my stressors.  I met with my therapist today to talk about my stressors and she felt I was doing a lot better.  Usually when something like this happens, the only thing that comes to mind is how I'm going to be laid off.  It's difficult to deal with and I now deal with things a lot better so far.  It's been three weeks and it was the right decision to go on medicatin."
