        "Summarize the following story in first person: I recently started a new position working in the IT field. This was the effort of several weeks and months of work. It had to go through several rounds of interviews and they were pretty taxing and stressful. The position will be starting soon and it's my first time working this type of job so I'm pretty excited and nervous. I want to do a good job since this job will be very important in my future. It's a government job, so your prior experience and reputation are very important in resume building and career advancement. It was a pretty memorable experience since it took about two weeks in total to complete. This included getting a background check, two rounds of interviews, contacts to all my references, etc. Additionally, they were panel style interviews, basically you sit there and 4 people grill you with questions. I also have some fear/ nervousness in the sense that I'm not sure this is what I really want to do with my life and career, but I need to make a commitment to a job and stick with it. I'm getting to the age that I want to settle and get a house/ wife/ etc, so I need a stable job to support that. I think ultimately this event will be pivotable in what I hope to be a long and steady career. This event happened in the past month, however I didn't get the acceptance for the position until last week so this is all still very fresh in my mind. I hope that I can look back on this in a few months and laugh at how nervous I was. I hope this position will lead to more opportunities and a better life."
