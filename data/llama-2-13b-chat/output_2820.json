        "Summarize the following story in first person: Our car was packed. We'd spent a lovely week at the beach and although we regretted having to leave, home was a welcome destination. Since we were traveling by interstate there wasn't much to see. We expected to miss most of the Atlanta traffic since it was a Sunday morning but as we got into downtown, all the lanes on I-75 were closed down except for one. The line of cars stretched well out of site and we were lucky to move at all. My dad was trying to move over to the lane that the traffic was showing a bit of movement but he wasn't making much progress. Dad decided swap through a few of the local radio stations to see if there was any news of the traffic jam, maybe get an idea of how long we could expect the hold up. He really doesn't care for rock music so he ended up going between a couple of the country music stations. I stared at my Gameboy, trying to beat my high score on Tetris and not think about how bored I was while my sister was having a good nap. Mom was reading a book and would occasionally peak up to see confirm we weren't moving. After about 45 minutes of sitting at a stand-still, one of the stations finally chimed in with the details of the traffic. I wasn't really paying attention, we'd all assumed it was a wreck causing the back up. \"A fatal accident is blocking most of I-75 north involving 2 cars. The victims are reported to have been two children and anyone in the area is advised to avoid I-75 until they get it cleared up. We'll keep you updated as we find out more details. Here's Randy Travis's 'Forever and Ever'.\" My mother was visibly upset. Her emotions seemed to swap between disbelief, a bit of curiosity but mostly sympathy for the kids. I think she even felt sorry for whoever caused it. I remember her saying how hard it's going to be for them to live knowing what they did. By the time we reached the scene of the accident the cars had been cleared and there were a few police cars blocking the lanes and workers from the city's road department cleaning up the debris left strewn about the road. Apart telling me not to stare, no-one really said anything. Once we made is past the accident, we were back up to speed and I had a feeling of relief. We still had several hours to go before arriving home and I don't remember any talk about the accident for the rest of the trip. Once we cleared the city Dad pulled off at a fast food place and we got some late breakfast. I don't think my sister even knows there was a wreck."
