        "Summarize the following story in first person: Recently my child graduated fro college! It was the happiest time of my life. i was so happy I was moved to Tears. The day of her graustion I musthave cried over 7 times. No one in my family understood just how proud I was. I had watch my daughter grow ffrom an infant into such a remarkable young lady that have such a promising careerahead of her. The day she graduated I could seem to get right. I was a nevous reck. My eyes ran across a visual check list I had made over and over. I wanted to be prepared. On that check list my main items were my poster(i made a large banner to show support) and my daughters congrats card. Even though I check that list I felt so unprepared. I got ready to go to the ceremony my daughter wasnt home she and I had agreed to meet up at 7. It was 6pm and I decided to leave out checking the list again, I was good! Nervous  but good. I arrived in time to meet and greet my baby girl and hug her until she insited it was enough. She handed me my tickets and told me where to seat for the best view. I was there in the huge auditorium filled with soooooo  many people all there to support their love ones. It was time after hours for my babys name to be called to get her degree. I opened my bag to get my camera to record the moment..........it wasnt there! I had left my WHOLE CAMERA at home. I could record anything. I was so disappointed. All the prepping I had done I still forgot my camera. So I dont have the video but I do have the memories!"
