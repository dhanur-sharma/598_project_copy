        "Summarize the following story in first person: Three weeks ago, I was driving my sister to elementary school. After just a few minute of driving, a large deer ran from a nearby tree and  in front of my car. I barely had time to react and hit the brakes too late. Unfortunately, the car was wrecked with much of the front end of the car being demolished by the force of the impact of the deer. My sister and I lay still for a moment, immobilized by shock and fear. I then quickly unbuckled my seat belt and checked on my sister, who was also wearing her seat belt. She was safe. Besides having some minor whiplash, I was also safe. This event has been reiterated in my mind dozens of time since it took place. I wonder what would have happened if my sister or I was seriously hurt or killed. I contemplate the fragility of life and existence.  At the time of the accident, I e was a nervous wreck, but since then I have been contemplating the purpose of life. I wonder every day when will my life end. When it does end, will I have made the most of it? I'm grateful everyday I survived that accident. It has allowed me to reevaluate my life. I now consider the path I am taking and whether it suits me best."
