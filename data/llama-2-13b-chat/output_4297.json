        "Summarize the following story in first person: I decided to go to the store around the corner to pick up a shirt. It was so close that I decided to walk to the store. My daughter walked with me to the clothing store. I looked around the store and found a few blouses to try on. I tried on the shirts and chose the one I wanted to keep. I paid for the item. I thanked the lady. We left the store and headed home. I put my change in my bag. I put receipt in the clothing bag. I dropped something on the ground and bent over to pick up the item. I got the item and we kept walking. Suddenly, I felt a slight breeze. However, I did not notice that my pants were ripped. Therefore, I did not try to hide the torn pants. I was walking and I noticed people staring at me. They were in a car riding by and staring at me as if they had never seen people. I told my daughter to check behind me because I did not see anything wrong with my daughter. She was walking slightly ahead of me. She saw my pants were ripped and my underwear wear showing. I was so embarassed. I practically powerwalked home in order to avoid more people seeing me."
