        "Summarize the following story in first person: the day that my son was leaving home to head to the dorms at college , I was so very proud but so sad as well.  My child was leaving me.  My nest was now empty.  He had his stuff all packed into the SUV that his father gave him.  I had gotten him everything I could think of that he would need to be starting out on his own.  I wanted him to have everything.  I was worried if he was prepared for life on his own.  I was worried about him so deeply and was struggling to let go with a smile on my face.  I did not want to burden him with my sadness and worry. I wanted him to be free and happy and strong.  I wanted to hold him in my lap again then I huffed at myself he was now 5 10 and about 180lbs  wouldnt fit on my lap anymore .  But in my minds eye I remember cuddling with him and playing .  I was proud he has done good never gave my one problem growing up.  No drugs  never skipped school no drinking .  I couldnt help but think he had become what he was in spite of me not because of me.  so seeing him leaving that day was such a mixture of feelings.  happy and sad and I was so lost.  I missed my son already.  That part of my life was over and it seemed like just a blink of an eye and he was walking away."
