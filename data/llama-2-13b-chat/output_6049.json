        "Summarize the following story in first person: I always thought that I was a dog person. I grew up, always wanting a dog, specifically either a golden retriever, an Australian shepherd, a Corgi, or any mix of the three. Sadly, my parents never let me have a pet beyond a fish growing up because we traveled regularly and they didn't think it was right to put an animal through an absent owner. Fast forward to my senior year of college, when I first moved into a house of my own where I could feasibly own a dog. I constantly checked Craigslist, Facebook marketplace, and the local shelter websites looking for my perfect breed. Unfortunately, it just didn't work out- the right breed never became available. Fast forward again to three months ago. I'm checking Facebook and I see a post in the group for my old neighborhood I lived in the year prior. A lady found a cat in the neighborhood and he had been badly beat up. She initially brought him in to rehab him for a catch and release, but he didn't want to be released. I was immediately drawn to this cat, so I messaged my girlfriend and asked her, \"What do you think?\" She immediately responded \"YES, you're more of a cat person anyways.\" Thinking that a cat surely would be more practical for me since I lived in an apartment, I went to visit the cat and immediately fell in love with him. He was so cute and reserved, and the lady swore to me that he would eventually open up to me and be the biggest cuddle cat in the world. I took him home that day, and he's been my cuddly cat ever since. I realized that I really am a cat person, and that cats are just so much better to have as a pet when living in an apartment building. He is the best decision I've made within the last 3 months, at least if you don't ask my wallet."
