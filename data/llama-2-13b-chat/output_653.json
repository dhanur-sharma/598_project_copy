        "Summarize the following story in first person: It seemed like a normal day. In fact, it pretty much was the most normal of a day that it could had been. I was out and about on my day off, when by complete chance I got a craving for a candy bar. I decided that I deserved a treat and so I went to my local grocery store. Since I was there, I got a couple more necessities so I wouldn't have to go later on in the week. It was then, in the flour aisle, where I ran into her. She seemed an ordinary older woman, no different than an average elderly person. However, she looked strikingly similar to my mother. It wasn't actually my mom (obviously) but she looked similar enough where I had to go talk to her. She was a very interesting woman, and surprisingly, she wasn't taken aback by anything I said. I told her that I thought she might be related to me. I told her my own name, my mother's name, and even some extended family's names. But she said that she had never heard of any of them. I apologized profusely for my mistake, but she wasn't upset at all. We decided to grab a donut and a coffee and chat. It turned out that we actually had quite a bit in common. I will never forget the day that I met that woman."
