        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was the start of spring. It was the time of year when the weather starts to change, the time of year when you notice people starting to wear less and less clothes. It's the time of year when all you want to do is go to the beach and enjoy your freedom and youth. The time of year when your cares follow the snow and cold weather; you're not sure where they went but they are not missed. After seeing all this winter snow and being holed up in the house all winter, the need to see the ocean and deep sea fishing became overwhelming. At the time, about 4 months ago, my car was 12 years old and not in the best of shape; hell, my car manufacturer, Saturn, is no longer even in business so how can I trust it to make it from Chicago to south Florida and back! The prudent thing to do would be to take my mom's car. My first problem was that she doesn't want me to use it. I don't see why we can't use it while she is out of town, she won't even know! If I gas it up after I am done with it, she would be none the wiser to my plan. In fact, I would even go so far as to change the oil of her car. It was decided then; we will take my mom's car! My next problem was my puppy. I can't leave a puppy by herself in the house while I am gone. My best option is to take her with us on the trip. There will be several people there and we can take turns watching her. It seems like the perfect plan! The my next problem occured when my mom's car broke down on the way to south Florida. We all piled out of the car and looked at the engine. It took us a long time to get it fixed but ultimately we were able to fix the issue. As we piled back into the car, I noticed our puppy was missing. We left the door open and couldn't find her anywhere in the car. As it was starting to get dark, we went to the car to get a flashlight and when digging it out of the back of the car, who did we find sleeping under the gear, my puppy. So sweet and tired from the trip, she was cuddled up against the warmth of the blanket under the fishing poles and gear; she found the one place in the back that was perfect for her size. Taking both of these signs as an omen, we decided to head back and find a much closer beach; t was an adventure but one that would be best spent closer to home."
