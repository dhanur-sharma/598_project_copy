        "Summarize the following story in first person: About four months ago, I started a new job at a call center as a customer service representative for a local bank. I had worked at an elementary school previously as a teacher assistant but needed to find something full-time that would pay better. I loved the school but I had no way to progress there. From the first day of starting my new job at the call center I knew this was going to be very difficult for me. Why? Well, I hate talking on the phone and that is all I would be doing at this job. My first day of training was really intense and overwhelming. I was the only person being trained and had two trainers assigned to me. They drilled me on banking and loan material over and over until my brain was numb. I went home feeling awful and uncertain of what I had gotten myself into. Why did I take this job? Why did I take the first position offered to me? I was filled with regret, fear and anxiety. I never wanted to go back. But the next morning I was there at 8 am, ready to be drilled again. I endured the first week of training but my mental health quickly declined and I couldn't picture myself doing this job. I just couldn't. The following week I switched back and forth with the idea of quitting or sticking it out. Finally, I knew what choice I needed to make. On the last day of my two week training I showed up and told my trainer and supervisor that I needed to quit. I was so scared and sick to my stomach but the moment I confronted them, I felt a weight being lifted. I decided I would give my following decision the following Monday, gave it more thought and ultimately decided to quit. I felt awful for giving up but doing so was one of the best decisions I could have made for myself and my well-being. I was nervous about finding new work but to my surprise, I landed a new job less than two weeks later and found a much better fit. This experience was stressful and tumultuous but ended up leading me to something much better."
