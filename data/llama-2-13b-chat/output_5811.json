        "Summarize the following story in first person: I got a certificate in the mail for my winning photo at the fair. I wanted to do something different and capture something meaningful. I decided to stay a few days in the South Indian Forest to capture some nature shots. It was a great way to get away from the stresses of the world. I guess you could say I am coping with life through my photography. Anyways, I would get up at dawn and hike until noon. Each night I found a different spot to camp near different habitats. One night I heard some really weird noises coming from the distance. It sounded like a women screaming but I knew that was not the case. I grabbed my camera and slowly started up to the hill when I saw something out of the corner of my eye. It was a bob cat and their young hunting. Mom was teaching her children how to hunt at night. I automatically grabbed my camera and I knew I would only get a few shots to capture the moment because of the flash. In that moment I was able to capture the most perfect photo of the three. Just looking at the photo you can see how proud the mother was of her young. I was able to win the contest with that photo and a nice little cash prize."
