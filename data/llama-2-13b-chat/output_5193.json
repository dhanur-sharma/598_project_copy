        "Summarize the following story in first person: I recently had a gender reveal party with my wife on October 12, 2019. We found out we were pregnant in July and have been so happy since. Every doctor's appointment has been great and the baby is doing awesome. I am so excited to have the baby. Anyways, so we had the gender reveal party and I thought it was going to be a girl. My wife was dead set that it was going to be a boy. We had a bunch of people over and my friend made chili for everybody. It was very good! So the time came and we all went outside to shoot off confetti cannons that my wife's friend put together since she knew what the gender was. They all counted down and we shot them off. Sure enough, I was right and it was a girl! My wife and I were beyond excited and are so happy we know the gender. We started planning for a baby girl to be born in March so that takes up a majority of our time. Everybody asks how we feel and we can not stress enough who happy and excited we are. We started planning the baby's room from the start as well."
