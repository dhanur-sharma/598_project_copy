        "Summarize the following story in first person: I met him before my freshman year of college, at a camp for incoming students. He was in my small group, but I didn't originally think anything of him. He tried to get together a few times freshman year, but I always blew him off. I didn't think we had anything in common. Eventually we became friends. He was there for me when I was going through difficult times. We became best friends. Eventually, he came and visited me. We did regular things, like going to ikea. However, I eventually realized I was developing romantic feelings for him. I knew that he would never make the first move, so I had to. I kissed him out of nowhere, and told him how I felt. He felt the same way and we started dating. Our relationship is great. That's how I fell in love with my best friend."
