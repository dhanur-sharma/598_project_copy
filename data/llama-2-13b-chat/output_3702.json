        "Summarize the following story in first person: A month ago a new neighbor moved into the vacated unit upstairs. I live in a townhouse apartment and I share parking space with this neighbor. I met him several times in the morning and we'd say hi and nod politely. This week I finally decided to introduce myself properly. It seemed like the polite thing to do. I baked some chocolate chips cookies as a gift and I knocked on his door. He answered the door and I introduced myself. He told me his name is LS and invited me in. He made some coffee and we ate the cookies while we got to know each other. LS said he's an electrician who just moved here from North Carolina because of his new job. He's unmarried and his mother is staying with him for the summer. I asked him how he like Virginia, he said he like the weather because it isn't as hot and humid up here but he really miss North Carolina BBQ. Then an elderly woman walked out of a bedroom and LS introduce her as his mother, MS. I apologized to MS for waking her up but she said it's fine. I looked at my watch and told LS I had to go because I got to take care of some errands. I took out my phone and exchanged my phone number with LS so we can get in touch with each other just in case. I shook hands with LS and MS and told them that to let me know if I can help them with anything while they settling in. We said our goodbyes and I went on my way. I got to say this went much better than expected because these meeting can get awkward sometimes. Luckily LS seemed like really cool and well adjusted person. I look forward to knowing him and his mother better in the future. This could be the beginning of a new friendship."
