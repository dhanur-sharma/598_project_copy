        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was wanting to receive an emotional and physical healing, so I visited the mountains of Arizona. Specifically, I went to the mountains of Sedona, and the vortexes there, to receive this healing. I was open to receiving this magical healing even though I knew it may not work, and it may be just a hoax. While in Sedona, I visited several of the vortexes, spent time at each one, and actually laid my body down on the rocks of the mountain in order to let the healing Earth energies, if present, to heal my body, mind, and spirit. While doing this, I felt a presence healing me as my body felt lighter and lighter. I spent many hours combing the various vortexes and rocks. I meditated, prayed, and just sat there, very willing to experience what thousands of people have achieved in their healing. The sun was hot and bright, and I had a wonderful time exploring the various sites around Sedona. And most of all, I felt my mind and body relaxing. I knew that I would be healed. Since that time, I've had little to no physical ailments. When I went to Sedona, I was physically ill. And no medical doctor could help me. So how did I heal? Why did this happen? I don't question that as I know it is a God moment. I was open to having my mind, body, and spirit healed, I felt that it could indeed happen, and so it did. I tell people, family and friends, about this magical event. I also encourage others who might be in pain, whether emotional or physical, to allow themselves to be healed. I think that I could have been healed in any magical place such as Sedona, but I am so happy that it happened there. I love Arizona and the mountains of the state. It's a very special place."
