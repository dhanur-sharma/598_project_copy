        "Summarize the following story in first person: My family and I decided to have a picnic day. We whipped up chicken salad sandwiches. They had grapes and nut chopped and mixed in, laid on a bed of spinach. Fruit salad was also prepared, one of the kids favorites. I had made lemon nut cookies so those too were added to the pile. The pile also included whatever else was in the kitchen that made for good snacking. We headed to THE BIGGEST PLAYGROUND IN THE CITY. It turned out to be a beautiful, interesting spot . Giant hills were the background to a tall tall playground  and nearby splash pad. The grey, blue, and yellow playground  was a three story tower to triumph. Children ran everywhere, enjoying the unique play, climb, and swing structures. The most memorable thing it had was a small zip line that was a come first situation. Waiting in line was worth it. Our whole family got to play on it for awhile. We laughed and zipped and picnicked.  We climbed the giant hills and checked the view. A beautiful day."
