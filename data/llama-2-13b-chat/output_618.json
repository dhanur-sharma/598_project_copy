        "Summarize the following story in first person: My friend Hank died three years ago, and a co worker had gifted me a session with a medium after the funeral. I was grateful for the gift, but passed it off as something I wouldn't do because I don't really believe in psychics or fortune tellers. Three years went by and about three months ago, a friend from my gym was talking about a medium they went to and how much fun it was. I remembered that I had been gifted that session after Hank passed away and got to think about going myself. I scheduled it for the following Friday and was pretty skeptical on what would go on. I figured it would be in a poorly lit room and woman with a bandanna would come out and grab my hand and ask a lot of personal questions then give me a bunch of hokum about the spirit world and lights would flicker and so forth. I figured it would maybe be a fun story to tell at parties. So i get there and this nice young woman, Janice, greets me at the door. We exchange pleasantries and she leads me around the corner to a big red sofa and we both sit down on it and she asks me why I was there, so I told her about my friend Hank, dying three years ago and wondered if he could be contacted. She asked a couple of simple questions about how long ago we met and where then we just began to talk. Not about anything in particular just things. As the conversation went on something amazing happened. Janice grabbed hold of my hand and looked me straight in the eyes and told me about the first time Hank and I met back in high school, and asked if I remembered it. I was dumbfounded. How could she have known that. I told her I did and then she kept talking about things Hank and I did as teenagers and places we went and it was just like talking to Hank. I could not believe it. We started talking about things that he was going through right before he died and how he thought everything would be alright and that he would be watching me to make sure I was not doing anything wrong and things like that. I was amazed at how it all turned out. I thanked Janice and asked her how she does it and she says, she doesn't know, that \"it just happens\". It was incredible. I have recommended Janice to several people over the last three months just to see if they have the same experience I did, and they all have. I called my co-worker back and thanked her for gifting me that session, and I told her how much it meant to me. She said it was no problem and that she was glad she coul help me be comforted after Hank's death."
