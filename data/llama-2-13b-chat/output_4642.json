        "Summarize the following story in first person: About two months ago my 6 and 4 year old daughters were returning to school. They were both excited. The older one was going into first grade and the younger in pre-k. They had a great first week. They were really enjoying school, the teachers and their friends. The second week of school we learned that one of my 1st graders classmates was very sick. She was in Children's Hospital in Philadelphia. We did not know much at first. So it didn't have much of an impact. Then, we learned that she had developed a cancerous brain tumor. She was only given 3 to 6 months to live. This came as an almost physical blow to both my wife and I. We couldn't imagine this happening to our girls. We explained the situation the best that we could to them, but they really didn't understand. It was and is still terrifying that things like that can happen to children. We are still having issues getting over it. We are dreading having to explain it again when the child passes. We are still hoping and praying for a miracle. It does not look good but we can old offer support to the family and hope that God has a greater plan."
