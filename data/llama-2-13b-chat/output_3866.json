        "Summarize the following story in first person: This story was about me going on a date for the first time in a while. I had to work the day of the date which was fine I would be off work with plenty of time, and it would make it so I didn't overthink what I was doing and make me nervous. I decided to take a shower around an hour and a half before I left so my hair was fully dry and I wouldn't look weird. I brushed my hair after getting out of the shower and got the clothes I was wearing to the date on. I then decided to chill out until it was time to leave, since I didn't want to walk around thinking about what I should do. I wanted to act natural and like I planned everything in advance. It came time to leave and I headed out to the restaurant we were meeting at. I got there pretty much as she got there and we took our seats at the table. We both ordered and then talked while we were waiting for the food to come out. I thought we were at least somewhat making a connection, since we had some similar interests. I learned enough about her that I definitely would have gone on a second date with her if she wanted to. The conversation died down a bit when the food came out because we were both pretty hungry.  As we were both getting down eating I had to use the restroom, so I excused myself. The floors must've been wet in the bathrooms or by our table because as I was walking back I slipped and fell face first into our table. I landed right on the corner and busted my forehead open and started bleeding. As if that wasn't bad enough, I also spilled what was left of our dinners and drinks onto both of us. I started apologizing right away to the girl, but there is only so much apologizing while having a busted open forehead can do. I ended up going to the hospital and getting stitched up. She never responded to if she wanted another date and I don't really blame her for that."
