        "Summarize the following story in first person: Every five years, a large event occurs in which thousands and thousands of people from my religion come together to fellowship, worship, and spend time together. Ten years ago, I attended it for the first time. Five years ago, I was one of the few selected to help be responsible for running all of the background events, activities, and safety. At that time, I thought it would be last one I was able to attend due to future work and school commitments. However, several weeks ago, my friend surprised me with the information that we would be able to go and participate, even if it were for only a few days instead of the entire week. I was so excited that I would be able to go and at least participate in some of the activities. We found a group of friends that agreed to host us and provide us with a place to camp (everyone camps out at this event) and feed us. The large evening meetings were the most impactful however. Since we were unable to go for the entire week, I had watched some of the previous programming on the live stream available. But the feeling and experience were not the same. With our group of friends, we managed to get seats right at the front which allowed for a one of a kind view. In years past, I had never been able to sit that close. The evening of the program, while we were sitting close, I could feel the emotion and inspiration around me and on the stage with the programming. When it came time to sing the theme song one last time, everyone was on their feet singing along, shouting the words as loudly as possible. It was dark, so the only lights were on the stage at that time, but turning a looking back it was a sea of starlight (provided by the flashlights on everyone's phones). It was beautiful sight to behold. It made me feel a sense of belonging and community, even though the majority of the people present I probably have never and never would meet. That sense of belonging, awe, and wonder made me realize just how connected we are throughout the entire world even when our paths only cross for a moment."
