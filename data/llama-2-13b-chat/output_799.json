        "Summarize the following story in first person: I can't believe that I was published in a literary magazine for my poetry. I had been following this journal for a while. One day, I noticed that they had open submissions for poets. It was mentioned that only a select few entries would be chosen for the next publication. Very close to my birthday, I found out I was chosen! What's more is that this was the first time that I had ever submitted any of my work for review. I couldn't believe that I was chosen for publishing without any previous portfolio. I was one of thirty, out of hundreds of submissions. It was amazing enough that they thought my work was worthy, but I later found out that all my friends did, as well! In the form of a surprise tea party, my friends decided to gather and congratulate me for my first published work. I couldn't believe it! They rented a beachhouse, and decorated it all pink. Pink is my favorite color of course! They had also purchased all sorts of teas and baked goods. The party was perfect. I felt so accomplished. Most importantly, I felt so loved."
