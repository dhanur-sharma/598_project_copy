        "Summarize the following story in first person: About three months ago, my husband and I were quite worried about what path we should take in life. He moved to Canada from South Korea for me, giving up his career and his family. I was living at home and working just over 25 hours a week at my parents' company due to mental health issues. I felt hopeless and really depressed, unable to imagine myself being able to become independent. I wasn't healthy enough to get a \"real\" job but I wasn't sick enough to get disability assistance from the government. I almost felt like there wasn't a point in living. There was so much I wanted to do in life, but I really couldn't see a way to achieve them. What's the point in trying to save money just so I can survive? I was sick of feeling so helpless so I started looking online for jobs I could do. I didn't have much hope that there was anything that could actually help my situation. However, I was desperate enough that I would accept tasks for lower than minimum wage if I could earn a few extra hundred dollars a month. Even one hundred extra a month would take a burden off of me. I didn't dream that I could get accepted into a long-term work position when those jobs seemed scarce and there must be so many more people who are more qualified than I am. At this point, I felt like I had nothing to lose so I just put together a mediocre CV and applied for the job. I didn't keep my hopes up and decided to forget about it. To my surprise, I got an email less than a week later. I was accepted into a position where I could earn a minimum of four hundred dollars a month and I would be able to do the job while working at my physical part-time job! The \"event\" of being hired may not even be considered an event for many people, but for someone who felt hopeless and depressed, it meant a lot to me. I felt like I could finally gain independence and be less of a burden on my family. My family has noticed I've become more bright and motivated to do things. Working harder is definitely stressful too, but it's now a different kind of stress. Now, I feel a little more hopeful for the future."
