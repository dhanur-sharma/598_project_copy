        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was the day before my birthday. It will be a day that I will remember for the rest of my life. My mother was calling me early in the morning. That's a rare thing because she knows I'm more than likely sleeping. Then she tried to get a hold of my girlfriend. That's when I knew it was something serious. I called and she told me that my father wasn't doing well and that I should see if I could make arrangements to go and see him. I then received a text, yes a text, from my brother saying that my father is with my sister now. My sister had passed away as well. I was confused. First my mom says he's not doing well, the next thing I know my dad is dead. I called my mom and said that my brother told me daddy was dead. She freaked out and hung up the phone. From what my brother told me, my dad had been dead but the respirator was still on him and that's what made my mom think he was still alive. I was devastated. I hadn't seen my dad in almost 7 plus years and now I would never get to again. I had so much to say to him and still so much more to learn. I still can't believe and catch myself talking as if he's alive. My mother isn't taking well but I think and hope she'll survive. I'm still mourning and probably will for the rest of my life. I don't ever want to celebrate my birthday again."
