        "Summarize the following story in first person: 3 months ago there was my cousin's wedding and I was one of the bridesmaid. We along some of our mutual friends threw my cousin a Bachelorette party. We invited a male stripper and did not tell our cousin. When we brought our cousin to the hotel room, it was total dark. We asked the stripper to pretend to be his fiance. He went ahead a cuddled a bit with her. When we turned on the lights, it was the stripper and we came out and started giving her the surprise. It was honestly one of the most funniest moments and she was almost crying. We also made a video and shared it with her fiance. First her fiance thought she was having an affair. He even almost broke up the wedding too. However after sometime we told him the whole story.  Her parents scolded us. Her fiance even stopped talking to me for sometime. But it was an event to remember."
