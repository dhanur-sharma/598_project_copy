        "Summarize the following story in first person: Dear diary, today I was with my daughter as she gave bith to her son \u2013 my grandson. It was a day to behold, 16 hours of labor, and all that time she was a perfect trooper with contractions and all. No way would I have done the same, remembering how difficult it was when I gave bith to her. I\u2019m so glad she didn\u2019t suffer as I did and that her perfect boy had no problems what so ever. Thank goodness for miracles like today. Every one was in the room with her. Me and Steve. There was Michael of course her husband and father. Mom was with Steven our son who took lots of pics. That little boy was so lucky to have us there for his arrival. The world is a better place with him here. I know that there will be so much he\u2019ll learn from his mom and dad. I\u2019ll do my best too just like I know Steve \u2013 his grandfather will. Can you imageine, a new baby in the family! That makes 3 grand kids now in all. What a wonderful life this is. What a wonderful world. What a wonderful universe."
