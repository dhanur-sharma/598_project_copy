        "Summarize the following story in first person: 3 weeks ago I had the most frustrating experience! It has taken me that long to be able to write about it. I was sitting at my computer working on my company's facebook page when I received this totally unexpected message on my screen from my internet provider. It said, \"You have exceeded your allowed data usage and internet usage time for the month. No further internet usage will be allowed on this account.\" I was stunned! Since when did our company have a cap on internet usage or data?? I tried to check our usage manually, but I could not log on at all. I tried from my phone and received this message from my cell phone carrier, \"Due to the increasing negative impacts placed on our environment from the increased building of responder towers, we are limiting our service to specific areas of high population bases. Please check the list below for your area.\" I have spent the last three weeks beginning to coordinate with people in high positions regarding creating free and sustainable computing options. These options would not harm the environment or pose a threat to animal populations. All would be free and unlimited. I can not go into detail here as I am not the most popular person right now. In fact, many internet providers and cell phone giants see me as a big threat to their bottom line. but just think, what that would mean for the common person?? Free service and free computing power. Never have to buy a new computer again, it would just automatically update! No high service bills either! Unlimited everything!"
