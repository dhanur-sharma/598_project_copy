        "Summarize the following story in first person: Recently, I had a conversation with my aunt. It was only a few months ago, May, I think? We talked about life. She mentioned needing a high GPA, and I guess I blushed a little--my GPA is terrible. I got to an ivy league school, and my GPA is abysmal. It sucks. Yeah, I will improve it, but it's an embarrassing fact that I hide. I want to go to grad school, I really, really do--but I just had personal problems. Multiple hospitalizations, all that jazz. It was embarrassing to admit, I don't know how they thing I could've maintained decent grades under all that pressure and baggage, but they do. I wont admit that I messed up, but I truly am embarrassed over the state of almost everything going on in my life. I just want to go to grad school to live my dreams, I guess? But I don't know if I will, and it makes me depressed. I'm an idiot. I just wish I could do it all over again, but I cant. I just have to live with it."
