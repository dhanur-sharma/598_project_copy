        "Summarize the following story in first person: So we took a trip to Walter Reed for my husband to get his back surgery. He hurt his back while at work, and had to get surgery for it. The surgery isn't going to be cheap either, so it's going to take a huge chunk out of our payroll. I wasn't happy at all to hear that. But he needed to get it done, so I don't get a choice. When we got there we spent a day exploring the downtown Washington D.C. It was huge! And it was nice exploring it. We had fun. A lot more fun than I thought that we would have. We saw some national monuments, and they were amazing. Just the best. I thought the trip was were worth it. It was just that great of a trip. I'm glad we went."
