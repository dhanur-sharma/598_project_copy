        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was a disney cruise I went on with my family. Not only was it a vacation, and not only was it a way for the whole family to get together and see each other (which rarely happens these days), it was also the last time we all figured we would be able to take a trip together with my grandfather, who had become quite frail over the past couple years. His condition was not improving, so we thought the trip would be a great way for all of us to bond with him at least one last time. The actual trip itself was fantastic. I had never been on a cruise before, and although I was slightly nervous given the way the media portrays cruises (i.e. Titanic), once I got on board I had forgotten all about that. The boat was huge and beautiful and there were friendly faces where ever you went. There were musical performances every night, and so many activities every day to do, from quiz shows based on disney properties, to learning how to fold towels into animals. There was even a theater on the ship, where I saw Coco for the first time (which I definitely teared up over). But the best thing was the food. There were a lot of restaurants, each with their own theme. Between buffets in the morning and five star meals in the evening, I was never hungry. My grandfather was with us for most of the activities, but there was one instance that gave us quite a scare. As I was moving around the ship with my sister, I received a message from my uncle telling me to come to his cabin immediately. Apparently my grandfather was really not doing well. When we got to the cabin the rest of the family was surrounding him as he laid still on the bed. There was a look of concern on everyone's face. My mom was trying to get him to eat a banana earlier, but he had stopped eating. As we were all looking at him worriedly, he suddenly jumped up and bit the banana that was in my mom's hand. We were all startled, but when his mouth curled into a smile, we all started laughing. It was the most memorable part of the trip for sure."
