        "Summarize the following story in first person: Today I was on my way to a doctors appointment when it started raining. The rain started out as a drizzle at first but eventually turned into a raging downpour. I remembered the weather said it would be storming today but I didn't realize how bad it was going to get. I turned on the radio and set the channel to the local news station hoping to get some info about the forecast. As much as I was focused on keeping my car on the road during this monsoon, I still had an appointment to get to and at this time I was starting to run late. I got onto 95 North and started picking up speed. The rain was seriously coming down now and I could barely see out of the windshield. Up ahead there were a few cars travelling about the same speed as me on this four lane stretch of the highway. My windshield wipers were trashing from side to side violently as I did my best to stay in lane. Out of nowhere I saw a white sedan that had been cruising in the slow lane start to drift over across the lane next to it. It turned sideways and shot across the highway, slamming directly into the black SUV that was about fifty feet or so in front of me. I slammed the breaks and felt the ABS kick in but it didn't do much to stop me. Both of the cars came together with a loud bang and collided with the jersey wall on the left side of the road. I must have come within about 10 feet of hitting these two cars as they were drifting across the highway. I passed the wreckage and looked in the rear view mirror as the cars came to a rest blocking three of the four lanes. I didn't stop and just kept on driving. I was so shook up that I just felt numb and scared. I thought about that event for a long to afterwards and easy it would have been for that to me in the accident."
