        "Summarize the following story in first person: A few months ago I had a car wreck. I was spaced out while driving when I noticed a dead deer in the road. I swerved to miss the deer. I was intending to swerve over to the shoulder, but there was no shoulder. There was just a steep drop. My car rolled over and into a tree. The car was crushed except for a small space in the driver side, where I was. Photos of the car show what looks like an unsurvivable accident. I survived that accident with only a broken ankle, a sprained finger, and an abdominal tear from the seat belt. It was traumatic. I still have dreams about the EMTs pulling me from the car. I am seeing a therapist to work through what happened. We are using a combination of talk therapy and EMDR. It is really helping and I am having fewer dreams. I am very grateful that I survived."
