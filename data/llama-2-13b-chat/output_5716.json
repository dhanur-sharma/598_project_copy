        "Summarize the following story in first person: In the last few months I chop down some trees to build a log cabin. The first tree that I chop down was about 70 ft tall and about a foot in diameter. I used to axe that I bought off Amazon to do the work. I was not very confident at first. It was hard to swing the axe for more than 10 minutes or so at a time and I got blisters all over my hands and I had to start wearing goggles since wood chips would fly everywhere. The first tree that I chopped down was undertaken by steps learned off YouTube. This involves put into wedge-shaped cuts on the front and back sides of the tree. One is called a face cut and faces the direction you want the tree to fall. The second is the felling cut and is 180 degrees behind the face cut. As I was chopping the felling cut the tree started to shake and Creek so I ran to the side to get out of the way and the tree fell the wrong direction. It was very scary as the tree was easily heavy enough to kill me if it had fallen on me. I later learned that a tree will generally fall in any direction it has a lean, no matter how deep a face cut you put into it. This was a frightening but educational experience. It gave me some PTSD in regards to chopping the trees. I was very cautious when making my face and felling cuts because having a tree go the wrong way can result in it being hung up in other branches which is very dangerous."

I was able to chop down a tree that was 90 ft tall and over 2 ft in diameter. I was able to do this with just a few swings of my axe. This gave me a sense of pride and accomplishment. I am proud of myself for being able to chop down these trees and build my log cabin.\n\n"
