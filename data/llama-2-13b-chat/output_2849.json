        "Summarize the following story in first person: My sister got married a several months ago. She got married right after Christmas and it was a beautiful wedding. On the morning of her wedding we got ready and had bagels. We got our hair and make up done. It was just us sisters and it was really nice talking and being together. It did not feel rushed or overwhelming. The bride was so calm. She looked so beautiful and natural. When our hair and make up was done, we left and went to her venue to get dressed. It was raining but that did not matter. All events were inside so we quickly ran in and did not let the rain bother us. I got to pick out any red dress I wanted to. I liked that we did not have to wear a specific bridesmaid dress. My sister got dressed and she looked so classic. Her dress was simple and really flattered her. When all was ready we walked down the aisle and had a fast ceremony. The place looked beautiful. It was still decorated for Christmas and just looked like a winter wonderland. The ceremony was quick and straight to the point but there were some really powerful moments. Once the ceremony was over the family took some pictures and then enjoyed cocktail hour. The food was fantastic and then once that was over we danced the night away. She had a great DJ that played music for everyone. People were on the dance floor all night. My sister looked so happy and for that I am very happy for her."
