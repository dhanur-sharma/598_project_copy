        "Summarize the following story in first person: About four months ago, I had to fight to keep custody of my children. I love them very much and I wanted to keep them in my life. I was very nervous to fight for my children. The court system seemed to be fixed against me. Even though I take care of my children regularly, I am a father. The court is biased against fathers and it usually doesn't want to give them custody. Mothers are often favored. My lawyer told me that it was unlikely that I would get custody. At first, the judge was very negative. He seemed like he wouldn't be on my side. However, in the end, was able to defy my past and win primary custody of my children. I told the judge about how, in the past, I was not a devoted father. However, as time went on, I cared more and more for my children. I became the primary caregiver when I changed jobs and started working from home. The judge listened to me and he cared about what I said. He decided to give me primary custody. I was so happy. Since then, I have spent tons of time with my children. I've gotten to know them better. I feel that this victory is extremely important to me. It's also good that the court system is beginning to recognize the importance of fathers."
