        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last month, I finally got up the guts to ask this female friend I like on a date. We'd been talking back and forth since last year and hung out often, but I didn't think she'd want to be anything more than friends. In the meantime, I'd been developing some really strong feelings for her that I hadn't told her about. I didn't know if she'd feel the same way, or if she'd be offended or what. Would she even want to go out with someone like me as more than a friend? Anyway, last month we were both invited to the same party. It was a nighttime pool party at a mutual friend's house, with drinks and food. We each had a couple drinks and got to talking about our feelings a bit more. I know it was the rum talking, but I suddenly blurted out that I really liked her as more than just a friend. She actually started blushing, and she grinned at me. She said she'd been feeling the same way but she was too shy to tell me. Well, we laughed about this and talked about how we should've both said something sooner. But better late than never I guess, since we've been dating for a month now. I think it's starting to get pretty serious. Who knew a rum and Coke was all it would take?"
