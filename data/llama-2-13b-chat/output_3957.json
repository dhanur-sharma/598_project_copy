        "Summarize the following story in first person: After being only married for three months, I asked for a divorce from my then-wife and asked her to move out of the house that I owned. She moved out that weekend, and in with another man, whom I had suspected all along that she was having an affair with. In the months to follow, we went through the divorce process. It was fairly pain-free in terms of splitting up belongings, so we had no children or didn't own much together, though it was an incredibly taxing period in my life. It was the lowest point I can ever recall having in my life. I got my life back in tracks shortly after the divorce was official by getting back in the gym, spending time with family and friends, and seeing a therapist. I worked my hardest to be truly happy and content on my own, not feeling like I needed a partner to complete me. Shortly after the divorce, I met a girl at a Superbowl party I attended. I was looking to date again, but this came very unexpected, as I showed up to the party and had never previously seen this woman. She was a mutual friend of two of my closest friends, and we chatted briefly. After adding each other on Facebook following the party, we spent a few weeks texting and talking at night. Eventually, I invited over my house with a group of friends for a WrestleMania party. She attended, and ended up staying over far past when everyone else left, which I hadn't expected. We stayed up all night talking and getting to know each other, before leaving for work in the morning. We continued to spend time with each other every weekend, and grew very close, very quickly. I'm happy to say we're still together and going strong seven months later."
