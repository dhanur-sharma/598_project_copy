        "Summarize the following story in first person: One recent event that was especially memorable to me was the wedding of my two friends, Marissa and John. Marissa and John have been good friends of my husband and me for years. They were guests at our own wedding last year. The night of their wedding was perfect. The weather was perfect when my husband and I arrived at the venue. Things got even more exciting when I realized that our wedding DJ was also the DJ for this wedding. The evening started with appetizers and a cocktail hour. My husband and I got to chat and dance with friends who we hadn't seen in years. After this, the ceremony began. Our own best man officiated the wedding. It was beautiful. But although this evening was dedicated to the union of our friends, it was very emotional for my husband and I as well. It was the first wedding we'd attended as a married couple. It was also the first time I saw my husband dance like he actually knew what he was doing! It reignited the flame in our marriage and mad me realize how lucky I am to be surround by such amazing people."
