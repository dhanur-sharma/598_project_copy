        "Summarize the following story in first person: During college one of the first friends i made ended up being one of my best friends. We had a great time together going from freshman who barely knew anything about the world to sophomores to juniors to seniors. During college we both partied a fair amount. In the beginning we mostly just smoked weed together and went to parties and drank. Eventually we got into the EDM scene and began doing MDMA for concerts and festivals and coke at parties. The drugs were always a secondary aspect for me though and I figured it was the same for him and everyone else. Towards the end of college and after graduation things started slowing down a bit. I transitioned to having a job and going out and partying less since I had to wake up during the week but he was acting differently. I found out that he had been using opiate pain killers since the end of college but I didn\u2019t really understand what that meant or the significance of it. I figured it was like any other drug, a secondary thing that one used to enhance certain situations. I began getting more and more serious about work and at the same time it seemed like he was going farther and farther off the rails. He never ended up getting a job and began asking everyone we knew for money all of the time. I didn\u2019t understand what was happening and as he became stigmatized in our friend group I cut him out of my life more and more. To me it just seemed selfish and hedonistic. I found out he began using heroin at some point and the latest thing I heard was that he overdosed and passed away. I feel a lot of regret for not being there to understand what he was going through and help him."
