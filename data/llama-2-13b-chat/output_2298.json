        "Summarize the following story in first person: This year back at the end of March, I turned the big 5-0.  The days and months leading up to my birthday was full of thoughts...do I feel old; would I feel differently?  50 is a huge milestone.  I thought about what I wanted to do to celebrate.  I thought about gathering a few of my close friends to go to a spa or having a dinner.  But then I started second-guessing myself.  Why did I want to draw attention to the fact that I was half a century old?  I don't look my age (so I'm told...) and I definitely don't feel like I'm 50.  So instead of celebrating with friends, my husband planned a last minute trip to Las Vegas.  While checking into the hotel, my husband took forever.  There was not a line to check-in and it seemed like he was just talking to the person helping him.  Well, once we stepped into the elevator, we went to the top where all the suites were.  That was really nice because we normally try to not spend a lot of money on hotels in Las Vegas.  So this was definitely going to be a nice weekend for me.  From our room, we had a very nice view of The Strip.  And then each night we were there, we went to a really nice restaurant for dinner.  Similar to not spending a lot on the room, we usually do not spend a lot of money at restaurants.  Thus, having a nice dinner each night was something different and something that I really enjoyed.  Overall, I was happy with how I spent my special birthday and would not change anything about that time."
