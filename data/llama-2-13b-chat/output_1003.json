        "Summarize the following story in first person: This is a story about the first time both my husband and I were able to feel our unborn child move. I was midway through my pregnancy, which is a difficult time as the visits to the doctor are still spaced four weeks apart. This means that for four agonizing weeks, we do not know for sure how the baby is doing. Once we visit the doctor, we can get confirmation that her heart is beating and that she is growing on track, but until then, we do not know for sure. Once the baby starting kicking, however, it was almost a lifeline back to sanity and away from anxiety, as I at least knew that she was alive and moving. That said, it was easy to start wondering if it was really her I felt kicking, as she was still so small and the kicks were fairly light. At times of worry, I would start to wonder if I was imagining it, or if it was digestion, or something akin. One night, though, the kicks felt quite strong, and I asked my husband to touch my belly and see if he could feel them. His eyes lit up, and he said he felt them. He lifted his finger each time he felt a kick, to see if it corresponded with what I felt. Sure enough, the kicks were at exactly the same time I felt them. This confirmation of my experience, and the chance to share it with my partner, was incredibly moving for both of us. It felt like our connection deepened and grew, and we were both filled with awe and excitement. Since then, we have had our baby. There have been many more meaningful moments, but this first shared touch still holds a special place in my heart."
