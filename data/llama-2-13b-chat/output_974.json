        "Summarize the following story in first person: Today I lost my father after a two year battle with lung cancer.  I am having a difficult time writing this because I felt as if Dad and I were starting to get close again after such a long time apart.  Until Dad's cancer, I hadn't seen or talked to him in over 10 years.  The bitterness that I held inside was very taxing on me and I'm sure on him as well.  When he left Mom for another woman, he destroyed our lives.  As a little girl, I always looked to Dad as my hero.  I truly looked up to him and thought of him as the greatest man on earth.  I always felt that if I ever got married, I wanted my husband to have the same characteristics as Dad.  After Dad left, I began a downward spiral and didn't want anything to do with any man.  Through prayer and guidance, I have been able to get past these feelings and realize that I can't put every man in the same category.  After Dad was diagnosed with Cancer, he asked to see me and we talked many times and began to heal our relationship.  Dad regretted the horrible mistakes he made and asked forgiveness from God, Mom and me.    Just saying \"I forgive you\" began the healing process for both of us.  Sadly, it wasn't long after that the Lord decided to take Dad.  I believe that knowing he was forgiven allowed him to die peacefully and with the love of God and family."
