        "Summarize the following story in first person: One nice evening, my spouse and I went for a walk in the little wilderness area that is near where we live.  It had been raining quite a bit recently, so the service berry bushes were full.  We enjoyed eating service berries as we walked.  All along the pathways, especially when there was tall grass on either side, were a large number of dragonflies flying around.  I knew that there is a spring of water in the area, but I hadn't seen so many flying around at one time before!  We noticed a female deer resting among tall grass, but once she saw that we were no threat, she remained where she was.  We also saw ravens in a tree playing with little sticks. The weather was very nice that evening; it was nice to be outside with my spouse enjoying the fresh air. There was an avenue of blooming trees that we walked along, so fragrant.  The trees were also apparently full of wasps and bees, because they were buzzing so loudly!  Apparently we weren't the only ones enjoying the fragrant trees.  One thing that happened during the walk was that a dragonfly landed on my spouse's shoulder, holding a wasp it had caught!  It was big (both insects), and I was surprised to find out that dragonflies ate wasps. The dragonfly landed only briefly, and then flew away.  It was a really wonderful, memorable walk."
