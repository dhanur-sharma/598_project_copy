        "Summarize the following story in first person: So, three months ago I reconnected with an old classmate. I hadn't seen him in over 30 years I was excited but worried, the only thing I was worried about is if we still would have the same chemistry we once did. At the end of the month we met up at a fast food restaurant. Once we met up again it was like old times and I realized that chemistry can't really die. It had been thirty years since we last talked but, it felt like we hadn't talked for a few days instead. We talked about old times, all the things we did in high school all the trouble we had gotten into when we were younger. We discussed old friends and old loves we had. We discussed our families and anyone we were still in contact with. I learned that he had married one of our old friends from high school and we actually made plans to have dinner at his house so that I can meet their kids and see his wife again. Its crazy to think his youngest kid of 4 children is a senior in high school. I feel like it was only a couple years ago that we were having house parties and running from the cops. Of course, that's years ago now at this point. I found out that he had a few dark years after high school, he told me the trouble he got into. He spent a few years in jail for burglary, but said those days are long behind him. We are both old now. We kind of realized simultaneously at the restaurant how two punk kids whose parents and teachers told them they were going to be nothing ended up having pretty nice lives. Also, it didn't matter anyway all the people who had their sour opinions about us are dead at this point anyway. We talked for a few more hours, before we realized that it had been a few hours. We made plans for another dinner, a week later. I can say that the chemistry hasn't faded, and to hold onto friends through thick and thin."
