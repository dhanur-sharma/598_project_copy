After some time one man came there and call my friend name. My friend went near him. the man slap my friend. So i went there and ask a reason but my friend never open his mouth. i ask again and again but he refuse it. Then the man went. most of the person were upset due to this incident. so the party stopped for 10 minutes .Then my friend refresh him and came .Then we start the party but we are not in good mood. So we encourage my friend and try to recover from the incident. But i felt it is great insult for me so when my friend cut the  cake suddenly i  came out from that place. Then my friend came and ask me the reason for my  quietness. I simply said nothing. But my friend feel guilty about my feeling. It shows me upset .So i not happy in his birthday due to that incident. But still i remember that incident i felt this incident never came out from my mind. I love my friend .So i never give up .I get the detail of the person and went to ask the reason. I know my friend felt guity and upset at the moment. So he also never forget that incident. When I was done explaining, he confirmed to me that humans were actual. I instantly broke down in tears, my heart was racing, encountering the concept of death for the very first time in my life. I felt when i loose my respect then only we realize our mistake. so i think it is one of that treatment for my friend. I felt really bad but the plus point for me to not have a close contact with that man - only a few of them recognized my mistake including my parents. At home, my parents really laughed on me very badly. This is a powerful memory charged with strong emotions. A very good reminder of the urgency to live."
