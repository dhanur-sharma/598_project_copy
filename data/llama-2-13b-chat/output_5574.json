        "Summarize the following story in first person: I started a lawsuit against five people/companies. They were represented by four different insurance companies and their lawyers who scheduled my deposition (answering questions before a court reporter). A snowstorm was predicted in the days leading up to the scheduled date. I tried to get it postponed, but my opponents refused. I had to wake at around 4:45 a.m. and dress in the freezing cold in the dark, and drive to a coffee house on icy roads to use the restroom and have a bite to eat. Then I walked on icy roads to the bus stop, leaving my car in a safe parking space. The bus trip was about two hours with one transfer to a second bus. The deposition was held in a basement room in the courthouse since they didn't have to pay a fee for the room. It was gray, with basic table and chairs, and without windows, dimly lit. I played dumb as everyone assembled and was able to overhear a couple bits of useful information. I was not surprised that they started by trying to pick a fight about our agreement to end by 5 p.m. so I could catch my return buses. I maintained my position but the nastiness was relentless. Two of them glared at me with hatred most of the day. At lunch we took a quick break and I ate a pouch of lentils and rice I had brought (no microwave available to heat it). One attorney spent most of the day questioning me so they could say they had many questions left and force me to return a second day. This was expected, a typical game, but it started a further fight about scheduling the second day. By the end of the day I was exhausted but pleased about how I had answered their questions. I had expected I might get motion sick on the return bus as I had on previous similar trips. The long bumpy trip with exhaust fumes trapped inside the bus, and reducing my fluid intake due to lack of restroom available, was almost guaranteed to make me sick. I had even brought a couple barf bags in case. I was surprised, however, that I threw up during most of the return trip. When I recall it, it crosses my mind that they poisoned me, not likely physically, but the equivalent psychologically. It took weeks before my digestive system returned to normal."
