        "Summarize the following story in first person: It didn't seem we were even doing anything illegal. Sure, we had rolled through a stop sign, but that normally is just a slap on the wrist. A slap on the wrist--if not, for that empty bag of marijuana in the passenger's side door panels we had forgotten about. \"Do you agree to a search?\" the officer asked. Feeling we had nothing to hide, we simply acquiesced. He began just rummaging through the glovebox, and we knew we were fine. Nothing to find, here. Then he knocked a book out of the door panel and out emerged an empty bag of marijuana with a few flakes clinging to the interior of it. It may have been there for three, five years, who even knows? What we do know, is that was enough to put my buddy, the driver, in court the next morning. The judge was aghast the officers had wasted her time over some amount of marijuana that equated to fish food, and she released him that same morning. We never went back to that city again, because usually a rolled stop sign does not cause a quasi-disaster. We henceforth were much more careful about leaving discarded trash in the car. You never know what that trash could be! When a rolled stop sign and an empty bag lands one in jail, is it ever \"Worth it?\"That is a definitive no."
