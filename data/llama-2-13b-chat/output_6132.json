        "Summarize the following story in first person: Reflecting on this memorable trip as we near the holiday season is very pleasant for me. Quite a few of my colleagues and friends are envious that my son and I spent so much time together. Many of my coworkers are younger and have moved as far away from their parents as possible and are a bit baffled that my family is a close one. During the vacation I had gathered a number of brochures and collectibles from each Walt Disney World park (Epcot, Animal Kingdom, Magic Kingdom, etc.), and plan to put together a scrapbook album to commemorate the vacation. During the week long trip with my son we participated in what are referred to as 'magic shots' in the Disney parks. A cast member/photographer takes special photographs and can place an animated character in the photo. The most enjoyable and surprising magic shot was standing in front of the Haunted Mansion posing as hitchhiker's. We didn't realize the photographer was adding our favorite ghost to tag along with us! She was paying attention to my son as he described childhood memories in Disneyland and which ghost always caught his eye. I am looking forward to printing more photos and relive the memories. Our state fair has a scrapbook competition, and while I am not an avid 'scrap book maker' I do have a number of photo albums. Utahan's in general are fans of Disney. This year at the fair I saw other competitors and regretted not having mine done in time since I felt my abilities were comparable. The experience certainly motivated me to finish the album long before the fair next year. During our family holiday party I can always recruit help from my nephew's wife and sister-in-law who scrapbook fairly often."
