        "Summarize the following story in first person: This summer, our family friends came to visit from Ireland. The story behind this visit started when I was 10 years old. My family joined a program that brings children over from Belfast, Ireland each summer to stay away from the \"troubles\" and violence that occurs in the summer over there. We were matched up with an 11 year old girl who came and stayed with us for 6 weeks. We quickly bonded. She became the sister I never had (I only have a brother), and she came to stay with us for many summers after that. She is a huge part of my childhood and we grew up together in the summers. The last time she was here was when I was 20... which was 10 years ago. In those last 10 years we both got married, had kids, and got homes of our own. So much had happened, and life passed us by. We kept in occasional touch on Facebook, and knew what was going on in our lives, but we hadn't seen each other in a long time. This July, she came back for the first time in 10 years with her husband (who had been here a few times when we were teens, but as her boyfriend) and two small kids. We got to meet each other's kids and spent a wonderful two weeks together. She stayed at my brother's house and we had get togethers, dinners, baseball games, and other fun activities. When I first saw her, the day after she arrived, I was so joyful. I didn't expect to be so excited, but I was smiling, laughing, and giving her a huge hug. It was a wonderful moment. We spent two weeks together with all of our families and children doing so many fun, memorable things. When they had to leave, it was definitely a bit heartbreaking. I know I will see her again but I don't know when. I hope and pray it's not another ten years, and I also hope that one day, I will get to visit her in Ireland, as many of my family members have done."
