        "Summarize the following story in first person: I learned my dad fell while at work and broke his ankle. My mom doesn't and can't work. They had to go through the process of selling their home. We first had to clean the whole house out, of our stuff and theirs. We also had to repair many things from sinks and faucets to putting new carpet in their basement because it was quite gross. Thankfully one of my brother's friend is a handyman and helped alot.  My parents moved into my house for a couple months. I personally reviewed their finances. I provided lots of reassurance to my nervous wreck of a mom. She didn't know how to live anywhere else.  For better or for worse, and I learned how private my wife actually likes to be. In the end, it was kind of sad for us kids, but they should have moved years ago when they realized they couldn't afford the home or the ability to keep it up. Moving them also forced us to relive some good and bad memories of childhood. My parents worked a lot but were still relatively poor. Since they worked alot, I got a little misty-eyed when I saw my little league and cub scout uniforms, both of which I only attended for a year because my parents wouldn't take me. The whole process and my childhood make me strive to be a better parent and get more involved with my kids."
