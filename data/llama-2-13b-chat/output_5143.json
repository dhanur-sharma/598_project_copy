        "Summarize the following story in first person: I recently went to my cousin's wedding. I expected it to be fairly uneventful, but it turned out to be quite an amazing night. I went with my nephew, he drove and we ended up getting lost quite a few times. By the time we got there, the ceremony had begun and there were no seats. We made our way to the outdoor area where everyone was seated and we stood to the side. It just so happened that exactly where we were standing was the entrance for the singer of the wedding. When she came out, I saw one of the most beautiful women I had ever seen in my life. I had no choice but to look at her and for a second I could swear she looked right back at me. As she was singing, I also felt she was looking at me a couple of times. I didn't think too much of it, as I felt she was out of my league. Later on that night, after the dinner portion of the wedding, as everyone was dancing, she approached me. She came over to me and asked if I was having a good time. I told her I was and that she was amazing earlier. She thanked me and asked if I liked to dance. I said no, but for her, I'd make the exception. We danced very close together and I felt like this was a once in a lifetime opportunity for me, so I asked if she wanted to step outside to get some air. She agreed. We sat outside in the cool night air, just talking and getting to know each other. She commented on how romantic it was out there, so I leaned in and kissed her. I asked for her number before I left that night, and I've messaged her many times since then, but have not gotten a response. I haven't tried to find out what happened, I'm grateful for that one night that probably never should have happened for me. It was quite the memorable experience."
