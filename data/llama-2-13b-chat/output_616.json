        "Summarize the following story in first person: It's been a crazy year since my brother in law passed from cancer. My mother still doesn't really reach out to my sister on her own to see how she is doing even though my mother should know exactly how she is feeling having lost her husband a year and a half ago. One of the more brutal things she said to my sister was that at least she had her two daughters at home to help and she had no one. My sister really wanted to reply that my mother had her husband for 20 more years than she did but did not want to stoop to her level. Whenever they do speak on the phone, it generally ends with my sister being upset by something my mother did or didn't say to her. I try to be supportive of both of them but it is very difficult. I always read that death brings out some interesting sides of your family but never guessed it would be this devastating to live through. I pray it gets better but in reality think it will end up that they continue to not speak to each other that often. I feel put in the middle of a situation that is out of my control. My other sister is just as bad about not being supportive. She told me that our other sister was never really a sister to her. This escalated during our parents anniverary celebration 8 years ago. There was a heated exchange between the two of them. Unfortunately that was the dagger in the coffin that caused them not to talk to each other for a long time. There was a lot of tension at my dad's funeral and some pretty awful things were said. Neither of them will see the other side and try to make amends. I'm deeply saddened that my own family can be like this with each other."
