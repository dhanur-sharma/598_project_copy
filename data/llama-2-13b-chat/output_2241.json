        "Summarize the following story in first person: When I found out I was pregnant with my son was probably when my family and friends came together to surprise me.  They told me that they were so happy for me and my husband that we were pregnant and expecting a baby.  My family rallied together and chipped in and donated everything that a baby could possibly need.  From clothing to baby furniture.  It was nice having my family support me in that way.  Coming together and helping me and my husband.  I would find gift cards in the mail, to little gift bags left at my home with baby stuff.  It felt really good knowing that I had support during this time.  As this was my first child.  Having my son was the biggest blessing and surprise I could ever ask for.  And having my family and friends involved in my pregnancy was the most amazing surprise and feeling I could ever imagine to have.  It felt good knowing that my family cared that much for me.  I felt happy knowing that the surprise and shock on my face from how much love my family gave me, was a blessing.  It was like family reunited and came together.  I am so blessed to have an amazing family."
