        "Summarize the following story in first person: I always wanted a baby brother or sister because being the only child got lonely sometimes. I always sat there in my room, playing with my Barbies, but always wanted someone to play with. Of course I had friends my age, but \u201cthey couldn\u2019t live with me,\u201d my mother repeatedly told me after my crying sessions when they left. I wanted someone to mess with and blame things on. If I took the last cookie off the plate, I couldn\u2019t blame anyone. It was clearly me. I mean, I loved being spoiled by both of my parents, but my dad wouldn\u2019t want to sit down and have tea parties with me and my stuffed animals, and my mother got tired of it after an hour or so. So where did that leave me? Alone with Mr. Penguin with his overstuffed white belly, and my favorite pink bear with the bright yellow hat that I can\u2019t remember the name of now. It was hot. Well maybe it wasn\u2019t, but that\u2019s how I felt. I tried to hide the tears that were about to come down by smiling. That always worked. \u201cCool,\u201d I said. My dad could see that there was some subliminal message that I wasn\u2019t telling him, but he went along with it. I stared into the baby\u2019s big brown eyes, complemented by long eyelashes I envied. He looked back at me and smiled. \u201cHi Legend, I\u2019m your big sister.\u201d It was a regular day after school, but I decided to go over my dads for a little while before I went home. My dad picked me up from Broad & Olney and on the ride to his house, he blasted some good ole hip hip in his oversized truck. When we reached a parking spot, he stopped me. \u201cSymone, I got a surprise for you.\u201d \u201cWhat is it,\u201d I said eagerly."
