        "Summarize the following story in first person: Three months ago, my life completely changed for the better.  I never thought the day would come where I would become a mother.  At the age of thirty five and after years of trying to get pregnant and having two miscarriages, I had given up on having a child.  My husband and I were looking into adopting but the process seemed pretty hard and there were no guarantees.  In the end, I got pregnant out of no where and I was shocked to my core when I found out that I was pregnant and I was two months along.  The fetus appeared healthy and I was on my way of becoming a mother.  Three months ago, my daughter was born; a healthy 7 pound 3 oz.  No one or nothing could have prepared me for the profound love I have for my daughter and I feel so lucky to have the opportunity to be a mother to my sweet girl.  I love her so much and my husband and I are so very happy.  We can't wait to see what the future holds and we are secretly hoping to be blessed with another child.  The changes in our lives have been mostly positive and some negatives.  The positives are having our child and being able to make life long memories with her.  Our families have been great through out my pregnancy and they have been so helpful in the last couple of months.  On the other hand, the negatives are not getting enough sleep.  I feel tired and excited most of the time, and there are times when I doze off every chance I get.  The worry for our child is horrible at times and its a major drawback for us because in the back of our mind we feel like this beautiful experience might not last and can be easily taken away from us."
