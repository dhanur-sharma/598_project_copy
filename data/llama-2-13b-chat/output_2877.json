        "Summarize the following story in first person: My family went on a trip out West this Summer. We visited many places, but the one we all enjoyed the most was Bad Lands National Park. I think the reason we all enjoyed it so much is because it was something that my parents, myself, and my young children all could enjoy together. The beauty was amazing, and he wildlife and natural land forms were something so very different than we had ever experienced before. We were able to observe American Bison on the prairie. The sheer size of the creatures is what stands out in my memory to this day. My children still talk about the bison, and we have included studying these animals during our homeschooling days. We also saw huge eagles and hawks! The wildlife that my children probably enjoyed the most were the prairie dogs, as they were able to get fairly close to them! The vast rock formations, and huge canyon was amazing. It was like a giant bowl in the middle of the prairie! We learned about the formation of the rocks, and you could see the different layers of sediment in the rocks. We spent the greater part of a day just exploring the different areas, pulling off at all of the scenic outlooks! It was an amazing family memory! I can't wait to go back when my wife and oldest son can join us!"
