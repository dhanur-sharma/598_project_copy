        "Summarize the following story in first person: A few months ago I was at Petco.  I saw a woman trying to wrangle a cat inside one of the cat cages while she was cleaning it, so I stopped to offer to help.  I held the cat while she was cleaning the cage and he started purring, rubbing his head on my chin, and practically went to sleep in my arms.  I got to talking about the cat with the woman, learning a bit of his tumultuous history.  There was no way this cat would have all the behavioral problems that the sheet said he did.  I scritched and chatted for almost an hour and, by the end, I had all but adopted the cat.  I took him home with me that day, borrowing a carrier from the rescue group to transport him.  Although the first few weeks were rough, he integrated well with my other cats.  The other young cat hid from him for quite some time, spending almost entire days under the couch and staring at me with eyes that said \"Who this guy in my space?\"  Eventually she snuck out to sniff him before darting away and, one day, I woke up to find them both on the bed.  Opposite corners, to be sure, but together on the bed!  It was a great relief to see everyone be happy.  I named him Kismet for the twist of fate that brought him to me.  He's been an amazing cat and even a surrogate dad for some kittens I agreed to foster.  He's very fond of kittens, letting them crawl all over him and cleaning their ears at every opportunity.  I'm really glad I met Kismet and I'm even gladder that he'll be a part of my life going forward."
