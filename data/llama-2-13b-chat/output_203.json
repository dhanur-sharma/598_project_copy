        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 6 months ago I learned how to forage for food. It has been an eye opening experience. I had no idea that there was so much food all around us that we simply pass by every day. It is kind of shocking to learn that there is so much plenty all around and yet we live in deprivation. I learned about it after I watched a video on it. It really opened my eyes and showed me something new. I did a bunch of reading and research which prepared me to go into the parks around me and find things. There is lots of food in the local parks in big cities. There is even stuff growing in the sidewalk planters. Things we call \"weeds\" are actually nutritious and delicious plants. I have grown alot since I woke up to all this. My horizons have expanded. My consciousness has increased. My self-reliance and self-trust has gone up. It has been a great experience. I would not trade what I learned for anything."
