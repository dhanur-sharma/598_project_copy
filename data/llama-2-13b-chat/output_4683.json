        "Summarize the following story in first person: I clearly remember that day having gone to the hospice facility where my grandma was approaching the end of her life.  It was a mad scramble with the family and I knew more than anybody that you was ready for her last days.  We assembled as a team and took shifts to be with her.  She was there probably about 14 days in a row by now.  The nurses that were coming in and out of the room had this look on their face like they knew what was about to happen.  The background was very serene and quiet and there was momentos of the family all over the place - family pictures, fresh flowers, trinkets.  My grandmother was laying there quietly.  She was laying on her side and had her eyes closed but she was still breathing. The blankets were laying on top of her.  Her hands were cold and turning dark.  The last few times I tried to talk to her, she could barely open her eyes but I knew she was there.  She had spoken of you times and I was always sitting by her side just waiting for her to say something to me.  She was extremely drugged and incoherent and barely able to speak.  I leaned over to brush her hair aside, and I whispered in her ear \"Grandma, I'm here.  We're not going to leave you\"  I touched her hand and she closed her fingers around mine.  She opened her eyes barely and said these words to me \"Don't worry I'll see you again\" As I began to cry, she took a last gasp and passed away.  I whispered to her \"Yes, I will see you again\" and I hugged her tightly."
