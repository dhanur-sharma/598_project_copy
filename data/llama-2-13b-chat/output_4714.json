You see I dropped out when I was younger, because of certain reasons, and now I went back to try to get my degree when I'm older now. But the good news is that I finally managed to graduate on my second try. Not too bad, I'll say so myself. It actually took me around 2 years to finish it, and let me tell you how hard it was to do so. The courses was hard. The teacher weren't that great. I basically had to do everything myself. But the good news is that I managed to do it and graduate with a smile on my face. I even got a financial gift from my mom when I did! That really did helped me out. I love you mom! Thanks for the help. I don't know what I would've done if I didn't get the help that I got."
