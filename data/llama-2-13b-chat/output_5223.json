        "Summarize the following story in first person: I recently started a new job. It was the Friday of my first week around 2:00 in the morning when my wife woke me up and said the furnace isn't working. I ran down to the basement and found over a foot of water. I ran to the storage room and cut the power to the furnace. We saw through the patio door over two feet of water against the house. We had no pumps and no one was open yet to go buy one. We waited until morning and my wife ran to the hardware store to buy a pump and hoe while i got ready for work. I was on a 45 day probationary period and did not want to jeopardizes my new job. I felt awful going to work because my wife had to keep our son out of school to help pump water out. Thankfully she got a hold of our friend who was able to come over to help with another pump. By the time I got home from work, there was only about 2 inches of water left in the house and most of the yard was drained. I sent my wife and kids to stay at my parents for the night while I stayed and sucked up water with the shop-vac. I finally went to sleep sitting on the concrete step next to the fireplace around 1:00 AM. Despite the fact of insurance covered nothing, my wife and are are very grateful that we all lived, it is hard trying to fix up a home after we lost so much in the flood. I don't know if there is ever a good time for a flood, but this  really feels like horrible time to have one. The real kicker was the day after the flood was my birthday, and I got to wake up alone and cold."
