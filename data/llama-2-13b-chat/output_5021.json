        "Summarize the following story in first person: I just started my own business in the last couple months. It's emotional for me because I've always wanted to be a business owner but I didn't think that would ever happen to me. I am a stay at home mom and thought that would be what my life would be until my children got older and out of the house. I want to stay at home with them but at the same time I want something that is mine alone. I wanted to be more than \"just a mom\" and now I get to do that. I love my clients and their businesses become my interest which is so interesting to me and makes things so much fun for me. My goal is to start earning enough my husband can slow down and be home more with us which would just be amazing. I get emotional just thinking about what our family can be in a few years thanks to this business. I can work remotely so I never have to leave my kids. I get to have the best of both lives this way. A mother and a business owner. I am so excited to help more businesses because the few that I have helped so far have actually grown thanks to my tracking of their money. They get more time at home with their families and can just focus on their business. This is such a passion for me. When I first started this business, I really never thought this whim of mine was going to come true. I was just looking for ways to make a little money as a side hustle for our Dave Ramsey budget and bookkeeping came up as a work at home idea. Wow, I am so glad I found that ."
