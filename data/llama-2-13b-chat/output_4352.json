        "Summarize the following story in first person: Recently I decided to treat myself to a concert at a bluegrass folk festival. I had wanted to go for years but never was in time for tickets. They always sold out. This past year I watched carefully for when tickets became available and I bought them early! I anxiously waited for the concert day. When the event arrived I was at the front of the line. The performers were top notch and it was a night of first class music. The vocals were melodic and the playing ability of the musicians was the best you would find anywhere. Even though the tickets were rather expensive for my budget it was money well spent. I would do it again in a minute. As a matter of fact, I am keeping an eye out for the next concert! Also, my love of music has caused me to recently decide to purchase a guitar. My goal was to become capable enough to surprise my granddaughter. She has taken up playing the guitar and I wanted to be able to bond with her through music. She is now a teenager and communication is not as easy. Well, I have been practicing very hard for the past few months. So recently on her birthday, I surprised her with a birthday song. She was shocked and excited.  I hope to soon get her to attend some concerts with me as well as we both have a love of music."
