        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was passing a house when I saw a young boy crying and asking for help. I was afraid at first because the dog in the yard was huge and looked as if if could bite me. Seeing this child by himself and standing at the gate had me afraid for him so I opened the gate slowly and the dog let me in. The child said his mommy was hurting and needed help. I am a nurse and so immediately my skills kicked in. His mommy was on the floor and about to deliver her baby. The lady spoke little english and was so afraid and kept saying \"help me\". I know a little Spanish to get by and tried calming her.  I told the little boy to dial 911 on my phone and hold it to my ear while I talked to them. I started breathing in and out to help the mom become more relaxed. I was feeling a little overwhelmed but knew that their lives depended on me. The baby came after a few  pushes and I ended up safely delivering the baby and making sure the mom was ok. They ended up taking the mother to the hospital I worked at and I ended up taking care of her that night while at work. The mother and I both cried when we saw each other and her husband hugged and thanked me for helping them. I can honestly say I was scared of what could have happened, but thankful I was there to help them. I will never forget that day as long as I live."
