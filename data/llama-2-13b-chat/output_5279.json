        "Summarize the following story in first person: I recently just got a new dog after 2 years since I had to put my old dog to sleep. I had the other dog for 12 years of my life. He was my first dog that was mine and mine only. I thought he was going to be my only dog id ever have because I didnt want to go through losing another pet again. It was something I just accepted that Id never be a dog owner because I couldnt handle losing another one. Until recently when i got a call of a dog that was taken to the vet a family member works at that a young dog was left to be euthanized. Turns out the dog had parvo and the owners either couldnt afford the treatment or didnt think it was worth it. My family member she could take the dog home and make sure he has constant fluids. She said she has a good chance at saving him but she cannot keep another dog. So i agreed id take him if he made it though. And eventually he got better. Tested negative for any signs of parvo. Hes a ~1 year old bull terrier mix ive been told and hes been so much fun. Ive never seen a dog love the water more than him. He sleeps in my old dogs bed now. I know they wouldve been best friends had they met eachother. Im glad i gave another dog a chance."
