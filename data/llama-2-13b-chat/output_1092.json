        "Summarize the following story in first person: My heart was broken. I don't know how to process this. I just received news today that E had passed. I am just so sad and numb. I can't believe she is gone. I am relieved for her but glad that she no longer has to be strong and brave. She can finally find peace. Selfishly, I wish I wish she were still here. I can't help but reflect on the last year of emails and all the thoughts and memories that we shared. We learned we were more alike that I think each of us ever expected. We found joy and humor in same things. A good comedy, a book and always in pursuit of those foods that reminded us of childhood. I am flooded with memories and thoughts of her. She was creative and so smart. She was daring and bold. Fierce. My mind always goes back to when we were kids at our first swimming lesson. We were tasked with jumping in the water that well over heads. She was was first to go as I sat on edge with her sister, scared and nervous. When it was Edie's turn she bravely jumped in without hesitation. She immediately popped out of the water, with a big smile across her face. This gave me the courage to follow her lead. And through out our childhood as we came of age and tried new experiences she was like an older sister to me, even if it only by nine months. These are the thoughts that make me miss her feel nostalgic for a different time.I will always think of her fondly and miss her for all my days. I will find inspiration and remember how knowing her made me a better person."
