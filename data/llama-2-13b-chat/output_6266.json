        "Summarize the following story in first person: I believe I know of one such story from a few months ago. It happened at a local university library where I read some  very interesting books and fables and books on mistakes and books on business and books on marketing. One day, I decided to take a break from reading business books and instead picked up a book on ancient Persian fables. That is folk tales passed orally down through generations, and then written down by the author. The book was published by the United Nations, it could have been published by UNESCO. Anyway, I picked up the book and started reading. It had some of the most sage advise I could have ever imagined inside of it. I was homeless at the time, so it really helped me set myself straight, and get through. I read one story about a queen who revealed her prince's secret, that he was in fact a prince at night but during the day he had to be ugly and fat, and a serpent if I remember correctly. He came from the Kingdom of Darkness, where everything is black. When the princess revealed this secret, at the behest of her evil aunt, her husband could not re-form into his day form, and had to go back to the Kingdom of Darkness. The princess wore down seven iron rods, and seven pairs of iron shoes, before she could return to the kingdom of darkness. It just goes to show, true love conquers all. In another story, there is a very small girl, perhaps 5 or 6 inches tall, who helps her father, who is very poor. She also stops some robbers from stealing from a rich household. The moral of the story is, no matter how small you are, you can always be of use. But perhaps the most memorable story is, when a man has to go on a cycle to get one end, and the quote goes, even if what you want is in the mouth of a lion, you must go and get it out."
