        "Summarize the following story in first person: I always wanted a house so when i got the chance to purchase one with the help of my dad i took the chance and went at it. The search was so hectic . I did not believe that it would be so much work and i did not believe there was so much paper work involved in it.  I went thru the process of getting a realtor then i got a listing of homes she gave me. I then went thru the homes listing carefully and picked the house that i think me and my wife would like . Most importantly it had to have a lard yard space meaning a large backyard that my kids can play in. We went to i would say about 12 houses before we got struck with excitement when we saw the house we wanted. It was absolutely not the biggest house but it was the perfect house and it certainly fits our needs. It had the perfect yard space and home was the perfect size, it was going to be easy for my wife to clean and it was going to be easy for me to clean the yard and maintain it.  We closed on the house and we moved everything in within a week or so. We then proceeded to decorate the house in our favorite color blue. After a month or so it was our son's birthday so we did a little party and invited a few friends. They came and told us and congratulated us and said how proud they were of us that we came a long way to when we use to live in the small apartment. I wanted to jump for joy but i showed no emotion but deep down i was super excited and happy that i could achieve something a lot of people cannot achieve these days because house prices are so expensive and people can barely afford their bills must less save for a house. I continue to take care and i continue to decorate my house the way we want it to look. Everytime i mow my lawn and i clean my gutters i go infront of my house and i admire how far i have come in life. I do not think i will ever be more proud of something i have achieved in life. I will continue to admire my accomplishments."
