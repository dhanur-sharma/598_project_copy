        "Summarize the following story in first person: I went to Japan in February with my parents to visit some family that we had not seen in many years. When I arrived, my aunt picked us up from the airport in Naha, Okinawa in a rental car and drove me to her house. I got to greet my uncle and cousins, but it was around 10 PM by then so we quickly went to bed. The next day was a week day, so my aunt and uncle had to work. My other aunt came to pick us up and we visited her house. We played with her dog and watched a bit of TV and then went out to eat. That afternoon we went to the local community center for a family party. Everybody on her side of the family was there; my aunts, uncles, cousins, and even my grandma's sister who is 98. My parents and I briefly talked with everybody and were happy to catch up with them and learn how much everybody had accomplished. It was odd to see my cousins all grown up after I hadn't seen them for years. After a while my uncle made an announcement to welcome my parents and I back to Okinawa. After that, my other uncle and my cousin (his daughter) did a musical performance for us. They played the sanshin, which is a traditional Okinawan instrument similar to the Japanese shamisen. The first song was a traditional song from the city Kitanakagusuku where they lived. During the next song, my aunt and my grandma's sister did a traditional Okinawan dance with fans. Once the performance was done, we had a buffet-style dinner which was provided by different members of the family; I felt emotional once I learned they had all worked together to cook us a traditional Okinawan meal. There were many different dishes so I knew it had probably cost them a lot and taken a long time to make. Since Okinawa is one of the poorer areas of Japan, this really meant a lot to me. Then my grandma's sister gave a speech about how thankful she was for my grandma, since my grandma did not go to school and instead worked to provide for her family ever since she was young. My grandpa had also recently passed, and she talked about him, which made me start to cry. Following this, my aunt gave a similar speech telling us how much she missed my grandma and how happy she was that we went to visit them in Japan. It made me sad again, as we wanted to bring my grandma but she did not want to deal with the hassle of traveling now that she is older. I thought about how much she would've enjoyed to see the same places she knew as a child and how she would've been so happy to meet her family that she hasn't seen in decades. Once the speech was over, we ended the night on a happy note by doing a traditional Okinawan dance all together. That night when we went back to my aunt's house I felt very happy that I was able to see my family and I was grateful for how strong of a bond we had despite not seeing each other for several years."
