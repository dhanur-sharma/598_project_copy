        "Summarize the following story in first person: So a couple weeks ago, the Parkers, my direct next door neighbors moved out. I didn't have all the details but they're getting on in years and going back to Jamaica. They were incredibly nice to my family since they moved in, so I'm going to miss them. And had some misgivings about the new people, you know because it meant another black family leaving the neighborhood and another rich yuppie couple coming to further gentrify. Plus there's the fact that there's basically not space between our houses, it can get a little too intimate. It turned out though that my new neighbor is Cara, my very first \"girlfriend.\" That's what I called it, but we were 3 or four. I played around with her in her place or my backyard, and for a while, probably until she moved away we exchanged Christmas gifts every year. It was a cute relationship. She lived next door probably until I was 10 or so, I should have put it together sooner that she's related to the Parkers. This was pre-social media so we just completely lost touch. We're connected on Linkedin now though. She's a web developer, just like me, so we had a bunch to talk about. She's got a kid now, a toddler, but I didn't notice a ring when we talked. And she's looking pretty good these days. It was great catching up with her, and it'll be cool to actually get to know her as an adult. We'll see what happens."
