        "Summarize the following story in first person: June 16, 2019 to June 23, 2019 we took our first family beach vacation to Ocean Isle Beach North Carolina. It was me, my husband and 3 boys who were 11, 6 and 1 years old at the time. I was very nervous about how easy and relaxing it would be with 3 boys at the beach, especially with my 1 year old, but it went so smooth and was so much fun! Our condo was beach front and we had an umbrella and chairs set up for us every morning so that made things very easy with 3 boys! It was also very nice to already have a spot saved for us. We spent every day down at the beach. My kids had a blast in the water and on the sand, riding the waves in the water and building sand castles in the sand. Not once was I stressed and not once did the boys complain that they were bored! The older two boys played great together and the baby was happy just being there, played in the sand, played in the water, waved to people that were nearby. He loved the beach and whenever he was tired he would crawl up on my lap or my husbands lap and take an hour plus nap. We also played miniature golf one day, got ice cream a couple of the days and went to dinner a couple of the nights. The weather was very hot but it wasn't unbearable. It only rained one of the days which was great! It was honestly one of the best beach vacations I have ever been on, if not the best. It was a very memorable vacation and I will cherish those memories that were made."
