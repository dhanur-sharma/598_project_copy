We did so many things together, and I loved it. We celebrated it and then we had cake, and then me and my friends opened my presents. And I got so many presents and I loved all of it. It was so fun to do and I loved it. I thought it was nice because I thought that we wouldn't have much fun, and then I remember that one of my friends got something for me that I really wanted, and it was a video game that I really wanted and my friend brought it for me, and I was happy when I got it. It was nice. I liked it. We had fun. I don't know why because it just was. Best day ever. It was perfect. And great. I just liked it."
