        "Summarize the following story in first person: I'm thrilled to be writing that my friend has successfully worked their job for the last four weeks and integrated into their new workforce without issue. I'm thrilled that it has gone well for them, I mean the reason they lost their other job was just bogus at least in my opinion. My friend is such a great person, they're a hard worker, they're reliable, and so friendly and cheerful. They didn't deserve the hardship at their last place of employment that they had to cope with and I just hope that this job lives up to everything they thought it would be. It all started three months before when they first got promoted to assistant manager, they were so proud. Suddenly they became ill, they noticed they were going to the bathroom more often with blood, and they just kept feeling weaker. By the end of the month they could barely eat, and they already lost too much weight for such a short period. I remember that they thought they were headed for their death bed that they felt that badly. But they just kept pushing longer hours, more responsibility because after all they had just been freshly promoted. By the end of the month the last day they worked before they finally got a two day weekend they couldn't stand for more then ten minutes at a time without sitting down and their thigh muscles were just burning as they described later on. So after managing to last until the end of the day just barely they decided to go to the ER and when they got there they were told that they just had a bad case of colitis and were given some tyelnol with codine and sent home. Come Monday they called out because they were just in so much pain and felt so horrible. In the middle of the week it finally came to head and they went back to the ER because they just couldn't go to the bathroom anymore. They were admitted and went through a month of hell trying to recover. When they finally got out they were told to not go back to work so they told their job they wouldn't be there for another month per doctors instructions. So after that month passed they finally decided to go back to work and when they got there the people they worked with seemed less than thrilled that they were back. After a week they were called into the back office and told they were being demoted because management didn't feel that they could keep up anymore. Then came the big office theft and they all pointed the finger at my friend even though they had a perfect alibi. When they had nothing else to go on they started messing with my friends schedule and hours to the point that they left them with one or two days a week. It got to the point to where my friend just quit because for whatever reason they turned my friend in to a scapegoat and it wasn't fair in the least so this diary is why I am so glad my friend has been given the chance for a new beginning they deserve it after everything they have been through and what they went through no one deserves but you understand that don't you my papery friend."
