        "Summarize the following story in first person: I remember going to my first cousins Angela's wedding. It was in St. Louis, Mo. It was her 2nd marriage. Her first marriage was annulled at the age of 17 because she was underage at the time of marriage. Anyway now she was 23 and very happy the way things turned out. What I remember most about the wedding was that there was no alcohol served of any kind. Made for a very nice evening. No stupid tricks, no arguments, and no one following down drunk at the reception. Just a nice ceremony, good food, good dancing, and good fellowship. As the night wore on everybody was enjoying themselves. I was too and so was my wife. It was good to see how she got along with my family. This was the first time she had met the farmers from my father's side of the family. Anyway the reception broke up at 2:00AM. Then everyone went back to their hotels."
