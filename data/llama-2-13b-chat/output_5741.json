        "Summarize the following story in first person: A little over three weeks ago my husband and I finally went on a much needed vacation. This time we decided to go somewhere tropical . The choices were Jamaica, Bahamas or Puerto Rico. After going over our budget, we decided to go to Puerto Rico. I heard that Puerto Rico was a cheaper vacation option with nice beaches and culture all around. Some of my family visited once before and had nothing but good things to say about it. My husband was a little reserved because of the different areas of crime there but I reminded him that all places have a bad area. We finally decided on date on when we would fly out and then we were off. We ended up stay closer to San Juan and just renting a car to visit other cities on the island. They hotel we stayed at was fabulous and had a nice pool and bar area. The first couple of days we sent mostly exploring landmarks and national forests. After that we cruised around to different beaches. The last few days we spend more in the hotel. We explored more of San Juan and just stayed close by the relax. Embarrassingly while I was changing into my swim suit to go down to the pool, my husband said that he saw someone staring into the room. He said they pointed and laughed at my well displayed butt. It was out for everyone down at the pool to see."
