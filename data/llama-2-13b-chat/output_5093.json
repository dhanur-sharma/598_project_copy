        "Summarize the following story in first person: One of my friends died. I hadn't spoken to her in a while and it got me thinking about how things have changed, both between us and how we've changed as we've gotten older. Little memories of her would come to me at unexpected times throughout the day. Most were positive but some weren't. I found myself eager to remember more. I didn't really care if they were good memories or bad, I just wanted more of them. I found out about her death through a mutual friend. We had all moved away from each other and so being reunited with this mutual friend and others was uncomfortable because of how long it had been since we last spoke to each other. We never talked about the fact we never spoke anymore now that our lives had carried us elsewhere. We just lingered near each other for a good long while, mumbling facts about our new lives to one another. But when we finally started talking about our departed friend, we all loosened up and lived through the memories we all had of her. Surprisingly, that part, the part I expected to be the most painful, ended up being the happiest time had that day. It was like we all hadn't split up after all. I once more felt close to these people. These people whose faces had changed little by little over the years to reflect not so much that we were older but that we'd lived through pain and joy and life and death. Our shared youth had become a kind of secret only we knew, and while our friend would no longer be able to share it we us, we could still share it with her."

We remembered all the things we used to do together, all the silly fights and the wild parties and the late night conversations that would sometimes go on for days. We remembered the time she got so drunk and threw up all over the bathroom floor, and the time we all got in trouble for sneaking out and going to a party, and the time she convinced us all to go on a road trip to the beach. We remembered it all, and it was like we were all transported back to that time, that magical time when we were young and everything seemed possible. And even though she was gone, it felt like she was still with us, still a part of us, still the glue that held us together. And in that moment, I realized that even though we had all grown apart and moved on with our lives, we would always be connected by our shared memories of her, and that she would always be a part of us, no matter where life took us."
