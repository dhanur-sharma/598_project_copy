I was my Uncle's favorite niece, my best friend was the only one I could confide in, and my dog was my partner. To loose all three like that, I felt that the world was against me. I cried in private and in public. I moaned their deaths feeling suicidal. I arrived to my Uncle's memorial service grief stricken. The next stop was to my best friend's wake. My last view of my pet dog was crushing. No amount of condolences could ever made this right. I was sad for four months and still counting. I am not okay with prepared or unprepared deaths. I lost myself in these losses. I am still so far negative. I do positive things in their memory."
