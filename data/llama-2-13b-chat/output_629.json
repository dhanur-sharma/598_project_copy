        "Summarize the following story in first person: My cousins organized a family reunion this June. It was held at the home of my cousin Denise's former husband.  To get there, my partner and I had to travel from our home in the Bronx to Manhattan. We did this by subway. Then we had to take a bus to New Jersey. First, we planned on taking a bus that we did not realize does not run frequently on the weekend. We decided to take the other bus, the one recommended by the host of the party. We missed that bus by a few minutes. When we finally got on the bus, we ran into one of the worst traffic jams I have ever encountered. It took us hours to get to the party. What did turn out nicely was our food contribution. My cousin Charlotte, who lives in Massachusetts, had mentioned in passing that she loves coconut flan. Therefore, I made that to bring to the reunion. We did not tell her that that's what we were bringing. It came out really well, and she loved did, as did her Cuban-born husband. I felt the whole long boring trip was worth the effort when I saw how happy it made her that I had thought of her and made one of her favorite dishes."
