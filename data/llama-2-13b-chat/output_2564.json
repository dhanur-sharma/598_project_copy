        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last April, I attended this birthday party of my friend. It was a kids party since it was my friend's daughters birthday party. When I stepped into the house of my friends, it was just pure happiness and celebration. You can notice and definitely appreciate that my friend put a lot of effort for her daughters 6th birthday. Some parents usually just tries to mingle and drink when it comes to spending time on a kids party, but me, I love kids birthday parties. I observe how the kids party was planned and I was definitely impressed with the party I attended. I saw a lot of fun games being prepared, so I asked or suggested to my friend if we could held a fun game kids usually play but let adults get to play it. She of course accepted my request because she is one of the fun friends I have like me. So we invited all the parents willing to join the sack race. It was just not a typical sack race, we put more layers to it. It was a sack race in which everyone should wear a blindfold and at the same time spell out words every time they jump. I was the one who planned the game, and obviously I was the one who won the game. They said I cheated because I was the one who formulated the game, but honestly they were just joking around and was very happy and had fun with the game. Instead of just talking and gossiping and drinking, I created something fun for people to join into. I was definitely proud of myself and I self commended my work that day, I just want people to have fun honestly."
