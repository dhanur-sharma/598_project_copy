        "Summarize the following story in first person: I recently celebrated my 10 year wedding anniversary.  It is quite a memorable event in my life because so much has happened in those 10 years of marriage.  We have been through so many good times and so many bad times.  To mark the occasion, my husband bought me a large bouquet of my favorite roses.  He then surprised me with a beautiful anniversary ring.  We went to dinner that night and enjoyed a quiet meal together.  We talked about all the fun things we have been through together.  We talked about how far our lives have come.  We thought about how much our marriage means to each other.  We have quite a supportive marriage so this anniversary meant a lot to the both of us.  After dinner, we picked up the kids and headed back to the house.  We decided to have a little bit of cake with our children so they could be included too.  It was chocolate, which is our family's favorite.  Having our children there to celebrate was important because they are an important part of our lives as well.  I hope we are able to celebrate many more anniversaries in the years that follow.  Here's to many more!"
