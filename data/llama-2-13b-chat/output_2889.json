        "Summarize the following story in first person: My story is about a near miss motorcycle accident. My wife and I were riding my Harley Davidson motorcycle in a nearby town, on a cool Sunday Afternoon. We were in a town not far from where we live, but I am not completely familiar with the streets there. As we came around a bend, a red light prompted us to stop. The street was not asphalt, but more of a concrete, very susceptible to potholes. As we leaned into the corner, my front tire slid into a deep long groove. This caused the weight of my bike to shift, throwing us off balance and nearly wiping us out. The road was quite busy behind us. I feared dropping my motorcycle, but at such a low speed, I was much more concerned with the traffic behind us. It was truly a frightening experience. We were both terrified, left shaken by the near-miss. Luckily, I was able to place my foot down on the pavement, which saved us from going over entirely. It all happened so quickly, and I am not the most experienced rider. I can still feel the uneasiness in my chest anytime I take off to ride. This is especially true whenever my wife joins me. I've become much more aware of my surroundings as a result. I also spend much more time scanning the area in front of me while I ride."
