        "Summarize the following story in first person: we were all home for thanksgiving, we had been cooking the day before and my brother and his wife had just arrived. she was a big as a house, meaning she was pregnant and expecting anyday. we had been watching some football and the wives were outback by the pool late in the evening when I heard a scream. i rushed out back only to see my wife with a look of disbelief and surprise , it was time, we had brought things with us just in case and we were ready. my brother ran to the truck our parents helped her to the front door, almost having to carry her. and then she yelled again. it happened in an instant and the water broke. thank god the hospital is only 5 minutes away we were there in 1 minute as i drove like a bat out of hell. so we get there the nurses take her back and i get suited up. i rush to the back and my brother and parents go to the waiting room, she was in labor for around 2 hours but everything went fairly smooth and fast. at 8:51 thanksgiving even jacob was born. a smiling baby boy. i thought he came out smiling but it was actually a breech birth. meaning he thought his butt was him smiling. we all got a pictures, and the rest of the family came back. she went into recovery and we all clelebrated Thanksgiving in the hospital but it was the best thanksgiving anyone could ever ask for. Jacob reiley walt was brought into the world and changed my life forever."
