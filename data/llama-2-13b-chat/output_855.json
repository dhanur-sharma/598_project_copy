        "Summarize the following story in first person: I work at a doctors office and know all of the patients. I work with a lot of elderly people and I remember theirs names, their family, and things like that. One of my patients, whom I love dearly, has been getting sicker and sicker. She has been diagnosed with cancer and has not been responding to treatment well. Recently she has decided to stop with chemo and radiation because she doesn't want to spend the last few weeks of her life sick. It was a very hard decision for her to make, and for her family to accept. After she decided this, she came into the office and we talked about what we could do for her. When she was in she handed me a card and a small porcelain angel. She held my hand and told me she thought I was angel sent from heaven to help her during such an awful time. She said I gave her so much kindness and love, and that I felt more like family to her than a nurse. I felt my heart break into pieces, but also I felt so loved and appreciated. This woman was going through such a terrible time, and she wanted to comfort me. I hugged her and told her she was my family too, and that I love her very much. We held hands during her appointment, and I didn't want to let her go. Now I go see her on my days off and always bring flowers and some sweet tea. It's her favorite."
