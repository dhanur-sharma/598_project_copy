        "Summarize the following story in first person: Well it's been about 4 months since I quit my last job. Man was it burning me out. I was coming home exhausted and had so little energy to do anything. Since then I spent about a week relaxing and trying to catch up on some things. I've picked back up some hobbies and found some happiness in those. I also get a new job that affords me a bit more free time to handle chores around the house like cleaning and laundry and the commute is much shorter so I have more time for family and shopping. Overall I'm doing a lot better since I've given myself more time for myself. There's such a push now to give all of yourself to your job, but you know the fact is any large company would abandon you as soon as they needed to cut expenses. I'm happier now and would advocate to anyone the importance of taking time for yourself. My sleep has improved since changing jobs. I don't have to drive as much and I'm not as stressed out with the requirements so I am sleeping better and sleeping in more. My weekends are more enjoyable too since I don't think about work. I also am able to leave work at the door when I get home. I hope this continues the longer I work at this job. Overall I hope it stays good and I hope to be there a long time."
