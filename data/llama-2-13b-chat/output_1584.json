I had to work hard just to eat. I worked hard to get out of the situation. I did some work online and looked for resources. I got my stuff together. I did my best. I got a job. I got a home. I am glad that I worked hard for it. I did it with some help from friends. I did it with some help of strangers. I got my life together and am happy about it. I ended up having a better life.
