        "Summarize the following story in first person: 4 months ago my fiance proposed to me on a romantic getaway in Gatlinburg, Tennessee.  It was everything I had ever imagined since being a little girl. Although I had no idea he was about to pop the question, my whole family already knew. In fact, they spent the past year and a half helping my fiance in preparing what they knew would be my dream proposal. My fiance, Alex, started  our day by ordering us room service for breakfast. My mother told him I loved homemade french toast with strawberries so that is what we got. After breakfast Alex took me to the shopping mall and told me to pick out a nice gown for the evening. At this point I admit, I was a tad bit suspicious but I was still clueless that all of my dreams were about to come true.  After shopping, Alex took me to get my nails done. By this point it was 4pm and I was really starting to wonder what he was up to.  When we arrived home he suggested I get ready for dinner. When I got out of the shower he was gone. But there were rose pedals and lit candles leading up to a note and flowers.  The note had an address on it, so I quickly but carefully got dressed and did my makeup. I rushed down to the parking lot and headed to the address Alex had given me. Upon arrival I noticed there were no cars in sight. I entered the  building and was immediately escorted by a kind gentleman over to Alex. We spent the entire night laughing and joking and just all out enjoying ourselves. After  we ate he finally popped the question.  Then my entire family came from the back of the restaurant to photograph us and cry with us. I still cannot believe he flew my family all the way out to Tennessee just for our proposal. And I cant believe my family had been helping him this whole time! I am truly blessed. Since the proposal he has never failed to amaze me. Today is our wedding day and I cant wait to see what surprises are in store."
