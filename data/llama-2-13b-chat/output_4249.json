        "Summarize the following story in first person: I had a bad habit but I can not really talk to many people about it. Im embarrassed about my past. I used to be a drug addict. My boyfriend got me hooked on cocaine and it has been a horrible, anxious very upsetting life. I have been sober about 3 months now and I feel so much better. I have a better relationship with my children, they respect me more. Im not so tired anymore, and im doing so much better at my job. My district manager is even talking about promoting me to shift manager which would be a huge raise. I have been going to counseling to help with my guilt and all the negative emotions overcoming a drug addiction. Thankfully my kids are young enough to the point they wont really remember all the bad stuff I did. Thankfully I was never arrested over it and dont have any real permanent consequences, except for my anxiety and depression right now. I am on medicine for that to help regulate my emotions again. I have been getting into my emotions a lot lately. I want to be able to please myself emotionally and spiritually before I try to get high. It is not even that fun getting high. It just makes you feel sick after you do it and you want to spend all your money"
