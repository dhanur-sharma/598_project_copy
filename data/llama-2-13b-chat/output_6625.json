        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was extremely sad to find out a few months ago that my daughter moved seven hours away from our home. My daughter and I have always had a close relationship, and I knew that I would miss seeing her so frequently. She comes to our house several times a week just to visit or have a meal. On occasion she will even come over and cook dinner for us. We would bake together, or just sit and chat over a cup of coffee. She is my only daughter and I'm not sure how much we'll get to see her. Right after we found out that our daughter was moving, we found out that our son was moving as well. This was a double whammy! Both of our kids being in different cities than us is going to be hard. Especially when they both get married and have children. I will really hate not being close to my grandchildren. But I know that the move for both my son and daughter will further their careers and I have to support that. My hope is that we will get to be together for holidays. My husband and I were both really sad about this for awhile. Then it dawned on us that we didn't have to experience empty nest syndrome. We would only have to worry about ourselves! And now we have to admit that we're kind of excited to experience this next chapter in our lives. We'll just get used to a new normal."
