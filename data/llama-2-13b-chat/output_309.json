        "Summarize the following story in first person: One of my favorite things we did is rent a boat and did some island hoping! Very exciting on the beautiful waters and pure white beaches Some of the beaches we just anchored out boat and swam to the shore. We found some huge rocks we could swim around and look at all the colorful fish.  We also rented four wheeler and got to ride them all around the island. While riding up very high we could look down on all the boats surrounding the island. We got great tans and had some delicious meals. A lot of great seafood! The shopping was unique as we found some great gifts to bring back and my husband found some nice shirts he liked. We did the town and shops their with gold, silver, rings necklaces just about anything you would be looking for.  We took a lot of pictures and video and have enjoy watching them. They have brought back fond memories. We have enjoyed showing them to our friends and family! We can't wait to go back. There is so much to see and do! It just a beautiful place to visit and we would recommend anyone to visit."
