        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last week a friend of mine called me and said an incident happened at the F.R.A. hall. One of the residents of the halfway house he manages was harassed by an individual about bringing a service dog to the F.R.A. . This was terrible because he is one of the most vulnerable people in our fellowship and was made to feel less than and unwelcome. A then was given a statement by the person with the dog that went into great detail about the event. He had to leave because he was made to feel very, very uncomfortable. I told the manager that I would follow through. I realized the seriousness of the event. When my manager talked to the person doing the harassment , he minimized the encounter. He seems to have no idea of the wrong he committed. I was angry and at first wanted to sue. It was an open and shut case. There was nothing done right. t was disgusting. It was terrible and it was unlawful."
