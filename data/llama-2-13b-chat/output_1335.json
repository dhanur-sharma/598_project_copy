        "Summarize the following story in first person: I always wanted to be with someone. I saw people pair off in twos and I just wanted so badly to feel that way. I would go to sleep some nights, admittedly in tears, because there were certain points in my life where I felt unloved and nobody could possibly fall for me. My best friend, someone who clearly knew how I felt, tried his best to console me. It was hard to admit I was suffering. Little did he know that I had fallen for him a while ago. He just took great care of me and I felt safe when I was around him. One night, my feelings of wanting to confess overran the feelings of wanting to keep it a secret. I blurted it out because there was no good way to share the news. He stood there for a second, seemingly shocked. I had wondered if I just tarnished my friendship. But moments later, he told me he felt the same for me. I instantly became weak in the knees and a flush came over my face. I never thought this could happen to me. That one night four months ago started a chain of dates and now we're very happy."
