        "Summarize the following story in first person: In early June, I discovered the person -- my wife -- had been involved in animal abuse either early on in our relationship or not too long before I met her. We met on-line in late Summer of 2015 and we met when we were doing a \"tweetstorm\" on Twitter in objection to the Minnesota dentist who had killed Cecil the Lion. Our who relationship --our whole being together -- was forged by animal advocacy and veganism. I first discovered the animal abuse by my wife when I started playing back videos she had sent me early-on in our relationship and additional videos she had sent me in the Summer of 2017 through June of 2018. The reason these where sent to me was for the intention of sensual and sexual and romantic purposes. I soon realized that not only was she engaging in animal abuse, but she had also gone to great lengths to conceal (cover up) images from what she was watching as she was filming herself for me. Oddly enough, they were not for me as she had actually filmed these all before we met or early-on in our relationship. She sent them to me as though they were current and in response to missing me or in response to a video I sent her. When we first met, she was living in Cyprus and around a year after first meeting on-line, I was in Cyprus living with her. The intention was for u to marry and live our days out together. The problem with that, is that she didn't follow through and after 9 months I returned to Oregon. That is when she sent most of the videos. It would be another 13 months before I saw her again. When I did see her after 13 months, she came here to Oregon and we married. She returned to Cyprus and I was to come within 3-4 months. Needless to say, I am sitting in Oregon typing this and I have not returned to Cyprus."
