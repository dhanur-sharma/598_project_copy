        "Summarize the following story in first person: My grandmother died earlier in the year. I had a hard time accepting it but I new it would happen soon. When it came time for the funeral I was mentally prepared, although still shaken up. When I got to the service I saw quite a few people I didn't know. My grandmother was a well loved person and many people came out. The service was beautiful and people had some great things to say. She had an amazing headstone engraved and her favorite flowers planted around her grave. I met some people from my family that I never knew existed! I talked with them and they told me some things about my grandmother that I had no clue about. She was so much more adventurous and daring than I had thought. I was told stories of when she was younger and how much she loved to travel. I hope to follow in her footsteps and be a great person as well. All in all the funeral helped me a lot and gave me some closure. I also have more people to talk to if I am in need. Thank you grandma for everything and I know you are watching over me. I love you tons."
