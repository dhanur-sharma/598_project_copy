        "Summarize the following story in first person: I have not been feeling the greatest lately.  I have had periods where I get really bad depression.  Two weeks ago, I had fallen into another deep depression.  I was really down and felt like I had no one for support.  I was sitting in my apartment when I heard my doorbell.  I went to get it and it was my old friend Gary.  I was so shocked to see him  He not only came to visit but he surprised me by bringing me soup he made at home!  He knew I was not doing too good and he came to cheer me up and give me company.  Having him there showed me that I have people that still care about me.  We talked for a long time and it was obvious to me that he wanted nothing in return.  It was nice to be able to open up about myself to someone who I know I can trust.  Greg convinced me to make an appointment to see a doctor.  He wants me to feel better, and I do too!  I am hopeful I will feel better in the future.  I am very thankful for Greg's friendship."
