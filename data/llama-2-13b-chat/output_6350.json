        "Summarize the following story in first person: A week ago, on Saturday, was a day that was full of surprises for me. I do not have many days like this in my lifetime. First, my husband told me that we would be going out for lunch. He said that it was to a restaurant his friends were talking about. Because it has been a long time since we ate out, I agreed. At the restaurant, the service was excellent and the food was very good. \"I told you so,\" my husband said to me. Then, surprise of all surprises, I stumbled on an old friend of mine. She is one of my best friends and have known each other when we were in high school. She told me that she was now engaged to my brother's best friend. I was really overwhelmed. This is because she and the best friend of my brother were sworn enemies when we were in high school. I was very happy to hear such a good news. I celebrated the news with a toast to her. I asked her to keep me in the know about any future arrangements. She promised to. Then, to end the day, my husband informed me that we were going to spend our next vacation in Paris. I had not yet finished rejoicing from that news when he presented me with plane tickets to Paris. I was overjoyed. I was overwhelmed. Paris of my dreams!"
