        "Summarize the following story in first person: When I joined the military as a teenager I only planned on serving one enlistment of four years. Twenty years later I am now sitting here wondering where the time has gone as I am in the process of retiring and beginning that next chapter of my life. I stayed in for many reasons but one of the biggest reasons were the promotions and opportunities afforded to me. Prior to the military most job positions I had lacked any ability to be promoted or opportunities for advancement. For those that had them the qualifications were vague, subjective, or I did not qualify due to things such as a college degree being required. In the military I found that everything was written so that things were defined and understood. Everyone had the ability to be promoted it was a question of if you wanted to be. What very few understood, though, was that you could go above and beyond just being promoted with the norm but hard work and knowledge of your job could be recognized by superiors with advanced promotion. This happened to me multiple times. When I went through the nursing program, on my last week of school, I had to study both for the nursing exam as well as my promotion exam. I was in the top 5% of the nursing class and I was the only individual to get a perfect score on the promotion board. I was promoted 2 years earlier than I was eligible to recognize me for my hard work. One year later I was promoted again one year earlier than I was eligible which, combined, pushed my rank 3 years ahead of fellow peers. This went on for my entire career. The hard work I put in went towards early promotions allowing me to achieve rank higher than peers. This led to higher pay raises and more income earned over time. It allowed me to attend education and training opportunities I would not of been able to otherwise. This allowed me to be able to afford materialist goods I desired and to pay for the family I currently share my life with each day. The promotions and income allowed us to have nicer homes, nicer cars, and more time off to spend with one another. Many complain that promotions, wealth, and education are all based on who you know and luck. I came from a household of poverty and am now considered upper middle class retired before age 40 with a masters in nursing. I am proof that hard work leads to those promotions and success in life. I made my own \u201cluck.\u201d"
