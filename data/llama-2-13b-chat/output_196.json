        "Summarize the following story in first person: Mom startled me one day early this year and made me very worried about her mental state. It's been a long time since I've seen her so sad. She had recently finished speaking to Aunt Rue in New Jersey on the phone when I noticed how low her mood was. When I asked, she told me she had just learned really disturbing news. According to Aunt Rue, my cousin Deena -- who is my mother's and aunt's niece -- has apparently joined what other family members described as a \"cult.\" We don't live in the same state and visit close to never, so it's not surprising that all of us up East were a bit suspicious of the claims. We thought the family Down South was exaggerating the situation... that is, until we went down to see for ourselves. Shockingly, we soon learned, they were not stretching the truth in the least. Deena, always a husky if not somewhat fat person, had lost so much weight we could barely recognize her. Her house, always pristine and inviting, was now a veritable dump with stuff just thrown haphazardly everywhere. The saddest part was that she seemed oblivious to how all of this looked to other people. Months later we still have not figured out how to get through to Deena.  She has resisted every attempt to break through her wall and help her understand how dangerous and unhealthy her predicament is. The family Down South continues to monitor her as closely as possible while attempting to not appear like they are stalking her, which makes her defensive, angry and argumentative. Meanwhile, the rest of us are seeking professional advice because it has become increasingly certain that we cannot get through to her on our own. Sad, perplexing situation all around."
