        "Summarize the following story in first person: My brother was getting married. I went to attend his wedding. The wedding was being held several hours from where I lived. I carpooled there with the brother of my brother's wife. We arrived at the wedding. It was the day before so I helped set up some things. They had rented out an entire resort with cabins for all the guests. It was in a  beautiful location. The wedding happened the next day and it was lovely. The weather was very nice the whole time. The food was also very good. I served as a best man, so I was involved in the wedding ceremony itself. After the wedding ceremony, there was live music and people danced and drank beer, wine, and other beverages. When it got late, I retired to the cabin I was staying in. The next day I drove back home. It was a lot of fun. I felt very happy for my brother and his wife."
