        "Summarize the following story in first person: The first thing that came to mind was what I believed to be a panic attack that happened a couple months. It all started early on a Monday morning at work. Typically Monday and Sunday are the most stressful days for me because of my dislike about being stuck at work for the week and that the weekend had ended. So generally I am at least a little more stressed those days than others. That morning I also had received a couple voicemails about a couple bills that had been paid for a non-profit that I am part of. Looking back it was an honest mistake because we restructured the organization and thus needed to also change the bank accounts. Generally we had a treasurer that took of those things, but once we had restructured he had left so I was in charge. Unfortunately, though I had very little idea as to what accounts we had out there and what we paying for and how we were doing so. But at the time being in the accounting industry it was stressful because in my own life I am very good at paying bills and always worry about missing something. Those calls got my stress level up to a certain point, but elevated even more was realizing that during a transition period of acquiring a person's work I failed to bill a tenant for several months. Even though I talked to my manager about it and we worked it out it still got my stress level up even more and eventually over the edge. It was around noon that I noticed that I was real jittery and issues typing or even talking. Things seemed to be serious to the point that I took of work and went to the hospital. Upon check-in they believed I may have actually had a stroke so they announced a stroke code upon which several doctors came and gave me a blood transfusion and several tests. Once that was all over though I began to calm down and feel much better.  In the end they did a couple radiology tests, which came back negative and they believed I probably did not have a stroke after all. It was only later that after thinking about it more that I thought it was more of a panic attack. So I am trying to do better about managing my stress levels and am thankful that I had been given a clean slate as far as my health."
