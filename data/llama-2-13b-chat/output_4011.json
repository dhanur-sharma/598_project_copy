        "Summarize the following story in first person: My girlfriend and I don't argue very much, and when we do, they tend to be over small things that every other couple argues about. Two weeks ago, we started arguing about why I never want to be around her friends. I find them annoying, so I told her that. I think its pretty common for the boyfriend to not what to hang out with his girlfriend and her friends. She took it as a bit of an insult, though. She said insulting who she likes is an insult to her character. The whole thing was blown out of proportion. She tried to trap me with stupid questions like \"so if I get along with annoying people, you find me annoying?\" and things like that. About 15 minutes into it, I could tell this was going to be a bad argument. I didn't realize just how bad until later in the night, though. We were supposed to go to dinner at my parent's house, but she said she wasn't coming. She loves my parents, and my mom's cooking, so that was a sign of just how mad she was. Still, though, it was such a stupid argument, so I didn't apologize. I went to dinner and then came back. She wasn't there. She decided to stay at her friend's house. I was shocked that she was so offended at this. We didn't talk for 2 days. We sort of made up after that, but its never really been the same. I think its headed for break-up soon."
