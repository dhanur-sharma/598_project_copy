        "Summarize the following story in first person: One event that was memorable, emotional and striking for me was a social mistake I made recently. It was quite embarrassing and afterwards I felt like I should've known better. My baby sister was about seven months pregnant and had changed the name of her gestating child from the one she'd originally chosen. She and her boyfriend had at first settled on Liam Michael. Liam was a name she'd been set on since teenage years and Michael is our brothers middle name. Suddenly they'd changed the name to Tucker Finn. Those who heard the name including myself, my boyfriend and my brother all privately laughed. Everyone thought it wasn't a great name because it rhymes with many unpleasant words, such as sucker and another word starting with \"F\". All we could think is of how that poor child would get teased mercilessly by his peers. Al three of us became increasingly uncomfortable about how everyone in the family privately snickered but nobody, includng us had spoken up. It felt rude for everyone to be almost sharing a private joke at my sister's expense. We began to surmise that maybe it was her boyfriend who'd initiated the name change or that maybe they just had not thought further about the name. So of course, I was elected to gently inquire,being the closes to my sister.  I thought was the right thing to do and both my brother and boyfriend urged me to. I finally asked her gently as possible why they changed the name. I said \"Tucker is okay but Liam was great and you'd wanted it for so long\". Well, she explained that they'd decided Liam was overused. She stated that she found my inquiry rude. I apologized profusely and said I'd meant no harm, I just wanted to be sure it was what she wanted. She accepted but was obviously not cheerful. Later, feeling ashamed, I googled etiquiette on baby names and realized I should've kept my thoughts to myself. The next day I apologized again and she accepted again, but was quite annoyed because after our conversation her boyfriend told her he didnt like the name Tucker Finn. Suprisingly my boyfriend, brother and I had been right that one of the pair didn't like the name but it was not the one we'd expected. In the end they named him Tucker Michael, which is a little better, I think. I will never voice my opinions of someone's proposed baby name ever again, that's for sure."
