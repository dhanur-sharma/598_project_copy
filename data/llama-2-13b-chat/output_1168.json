        "Summarize the following story in first person: Four months ago, Dodgers Stadium was having another of its free admission days. It was early September in Los Angeles, so it was still summer and annoyingly hot to be outdoors in the sun. Before game time, there were some booths set up with crafts that the kids could make and carnival fair games. We chose the ones that were in the most shaded locations. Nigel had never tried throwing bean bags into holes, but was a natural at it. He won a stuffed toy penguin! Sabine glued cotton balls onto a wooden cutout of a cat to create 'fur.' We had a healthy family debate about whether the dunking booth was more cruel or funny to the baseball player being plunged into the water. As game time approached, we found seats in a less crowded area. It gave us more breathing space but required getting out the binoculars to see the players close-up if we did not want to watch the view screens. I was worried that the children would not have the attention span to sit through an entire baseball game. I expected that we might have to leave after a couple of innings. Let's be honest, I have no interest in baseball and didn't want to stay all night myself! I let each child have one packet of peanuts with a bottle of water. I was not going to let them get high on sugar and caffeine. When we had gotten the gist of it all, we decided that we were ready to call it a night. We will probably do it again next year."
