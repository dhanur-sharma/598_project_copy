        "Summarize the following story in first person: The Summer day that my niece and I spent together Started with getting up early and going to breakfast.  We went to IHOP and ordered pancakes.  The waitress was really nice and the food was really good.  We were not in a rush so we took our time and enjoyed the meal.  Afterwards we went to see the movie The Lion King.  It had just been released and my niece was looking forward to the movie.  I was also eager to see it because I had seen the original when I was a kid.  The movie was very good and we both enjoyed watching it.  As we walked out of the theater we both were talking about our favorite parts of the movie.  We both decided that we like the very beginning and the very end of the movie.  We then got into my car and drove the twenty minutes to the skating rink.  My niece and I both like to skate so going to the skating rink is a lot of fun.  When we arrived at the rink it was not too crowded and I paid for admission and to rent a pair of skates for my niece.  I already had skates so we saved a little money.  We both put our skates on and started skating.  My niece had really improved since the last time I saw her skate.  We both skated for a couple of hours and then after we were tired we decided to leave.  It was a lot of fun but can be really exhausting.  I drove us home and at that time it was late afternoon.  After a long day with a lot of fun we both fell asleep early.  It was a great day that I will always remember."
