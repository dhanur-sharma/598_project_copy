        "Summarize the following story in first person: My entry was about the time I took my daughters and wife to six flags magic mountain in california. We had a week and drove down to the amusement park to have fun for the week. My youngest daughter was so excited to get to the park. She loved the hanna barbara characters as well as the dc superheros which was my personal favorite. The roller coasters were amazing batman the ride and goliath were two of the girls favorite. While my wife enjoyed the shops with t shirts and the cafes were super amazing. The food was great and at somewhat reasonable prices. The weather was spot on not to cold not to hot in the mid 70's and sunny. I really enjoyed seeing the girls interact with the people and other kids. We went to the water park as well were dc characters swam with the kids.  The prices for the tickets werent bad at all. I really enjoyed my time at the park. I would go again at anytime. It was one of our most memorable trips we have had. I have som many memories from our trip. The smiles on the kids faces. And the feeling of fun and excitement we had."
