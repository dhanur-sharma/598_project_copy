        "Summarize the following story in first person: Six months ago,my sister and I went on vacation. We decided to go to Mexico because it really is not far from where we live but yet it is a very different place to visit once you are there. We had decided that Mexico City was the most interesting place that we could visit. We had heard that there were some dangers in the country but where we were going,it was fairly safe. The problems for us started when we got off our plane. Our brochure said that there was a place that we could rent a car near the airport and we were walking to that location when we thought we noticed someone following us from a distance. When we arrived at  the place that was supposed to be a place that rented cars we soon found out that it was a parking lot that looked like at one time they could have rented cars.                               In our confusion we barely noticed that the car we thought might have been following us was slowing to a stop and had another car with it. We only paid so much attention until the men in the cars started to get out. There were a total of four men and we did not know any of them but they were placing all of their attention on us. We had been warned about dangers in country and how human trafficking and coyotes had become prominent in many places. This is where we realized that the men were together in looking for subjects that were not familiar with where they were and had no real way out.                                  That is when the driver of the white car grabbed my sister by her arm really hard and began to pull her towards his car with all his strength. I ran to him and hit him in his head as hard as I could with hope to stop him from taking my sister. Of course,by this time she is yelling at the top of her lungs and the other three guys are jumping on me to stop me from hurting their friend. As a result,there was an attendant at the lot that overheard her screams. He called the local police to get help to us because he was fenced in the lot he could not do anything else.                                     Thanks to my training with former CIA agents who were my friends,all of my instincts merged together with memory of training. I did a spinning back fist and knocked the first guy to the ground. The next acted as if he wanted to go toe to toe,so my first combination started with a left fake pump followed by an overhand right that he was unprepared for,this smashed his nose and knocked him out. The third guy was scared ,since he refused to get to close I jumped in to the air,kicked him so hard in the temple that he lost consciousness immediately. And as I spun around to face my final opponent,the police sirens scared the guy off that had a hold of my sister,he ran. The three that were at the scene were arrested and the other got away thanks to law enforcement. The police took us back to the airport and we went home."

It is a shame that we had to go through that but I will never forget the lesson that I learned on that trip. It is important to pay attention to your surroundings no matter where you are,and never underestimate the danger of a situation. I am glad that I was able to protect my sister and myself and that we made it home safely. "
