        "Summarize the following story in first person: We were married for 10 years--and from that marriage we had two twin girls--who are both 9 year olds. For years, the marriage was crumbling. My husband and I had communication problems. I had lost my job about a year ago, and that compounded the issues we had. If we did decide to \"communicate\", it was usually over yelling matches. Just a toxic environment for our kids--hence, why we are heading to divorce court. Since my husband is the breadwinner, he wants to take my kids from me. He is suing for full custody--limiting my interactions with my two daughters. I might only to get to see them on the weekends. I'm sure the judge will give him what he wants, since he is the one with a full-time job, and I still have failed to find one. I\"m going to lose my home, marriage, and even worst, my daughters. This has been a horrible year! We had started divorce proceedings three weeks ago, and this has been a rough three weeks. My husband brings my daughters over on the weekends. It's hard just getting to see them for a weekend."
