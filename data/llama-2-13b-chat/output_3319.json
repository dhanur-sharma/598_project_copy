        "Summarize the following story in first person: In my previous job, I had a supervisor who was abusive toward employees in positions lower than hers. She would frequently criticize employees in the open, in front of others, engaged in verbally abusive behavior, and was very manipulative. At the end of March, I decided I'd had enough and decided to quit my job. I did not leave gracefully, and should have turned in two weeks notice; but I was very frustrated and angry and walked out of my job on a Friday afternoon. I spent two months looking for a new job. There were ups and downs, much hope for certain positions and much letdown when I was turned down for many positions. There was animosity between myself and my wife, as I was not contributing to our household income for two months, and we had to dip into our savings. I did get to bond somewhat with my 5-year-old son, because I was taking him to school and picking him up in the afternoons. I was somewhat depressed and feeling down on myself for acting impulsively and leaving my job abruptly and putting my family in that situation. I was also somewhat disappointed in my manager (supervisor's boss) at my previous job, because I had worked with her for nearly four years and had expressed frustration and concern with my supervisor's behavior. My disappointment was due to the fact that nothing was done to change the situation; and also that I never heard from her after I left. I emailed to explain the situation, tried calling and left voicemails, but heard nothing. I now have another job that is much less stressful. The benefits are similar and my take home pay is a bit less; but the difference in atmosphere is worth it to me. This has been a valuable learning experience for me. I will never again leave a job without having something else lined up. I also learned to treat work relationships like work relationships. I am not going to work to make friends, I am going to work to make money and provide for my family."
