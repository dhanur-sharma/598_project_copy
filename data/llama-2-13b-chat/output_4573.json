We were all so excited to enter the lake.  We took the floats and entered the lake. I was holding my son and my husband was taking care of my daughter ( 5 yr old). We were all talking and playing. Suddenly I noticed that my daughter was missing. I was so much panicked and shocked. I shouted at my husband and he also panicked. our friends started looking here and there. I started shouting. Then I noticed that my daughter was sitting in the shore and playing in the sand. Few seconds I was so terrified and I experienced the fear of losing a child. I thanked God for keeping my family together. Me and my husband decided to be more careful hereafter."
