        "Summarize the following story in first person: 7/26/19Dear diary,Today was a tough day. I took my dad to Veterans Hospital for his yearly check-up and the doctors were very concerned because his blood pressure reached up to 195 and the doctors went into full panic mode. This was one of the numbest days I have experienced in a long time. The doctors rushed and gave him medicine to get his blood pressure down. The doctor told me that he could of had a stroke or a heart attack. I was shocked. Even though I know my dad is 77, he is very active and in good health.  He hates going to the doctors and he truly would not have went unless he had to. I feel like I have to be more responsible for his health now. He looks like he is 50, but the reality is he's not. I just can't imagine loosing him. I have to dedicate myself to making sure he's okay. I know its hard but I have to do it. I am still worried about him. The doctors were great and compassionate. I'm glad we went to the doctor today, his elevated high blood pressure could of lead to something very serious."
