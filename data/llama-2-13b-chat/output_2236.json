        "Summarize the following story in first person: I come from a very small family. There was just my mom and dad, my sister and me. Because of this, we have always been a tight knit group. I have no children so my sister's children are somewhat like my own. We always visit each other on holidays and do special things for each other when we can. When it was time for my nephew to graduate from high school, I got a special, personal invitation to attend. He lives in Washington, D.C. with his parents while I live in Florida. Therefore, the trip required a little extra planning to make sure I could take vacation time from work and spend some time in the D.C. area during the graduation time. So the trip was planned, and I arrived a few days before the graduation just to spend a little extra time with my sister and other nephew. My oldest nephew was away at camp on the day I arrived so I did not see him at first. That night, we drove to his school to pick him up when camp was over. I still remember him running from the bus towards me and literally picking me up off the ground for a big hug. He has always had my heart that way. We spent some time catching up with him telling me everything that was planned. The graduation was the next day so there was lots to do. We got his outfit ready and planned everything for the next day. Of course, we stayed up late but was still up early for graduation day. He left a bit early because the graduates needed to be there in advance to get in place for the procession. We took lots of pictures and thoroughly enjoyed the ceremony which was surprisingly short. After the ceremony, we headed to a special restaurant for lunch and then enjoyed the sights around the D.C. area. I will always remember this special day and this boy who has my heart."
