        "Summarize the following story in first person: After having to give up on school to work full time; I decided to go back to school. I was afraid that I would fail at it because of the negative experience that I had going the first time. I took alot of planning to keep myself prepared mentally to go back. But i felt smart, wise and more dedicated to doing my best that I knew it would be worth going back to school. I made sure to make school my top priority that I was going to do as well as I wanted to. I worked very hard and was very stressed making sure to not just pass but to as good as I could. I was able to complete school with all the hard work I had done.  I got a high gpa like I knew I could. I was excited to share with friends and family how well I did. I was very proud of myself that I accomplished something I set my mind to and knew I would finish. I was very happy that I graduated. I now know that I will go back again to get an even higher degree. I think it made me alot stronger and more mature for returning. I realized my strengths and put them to use in my career. I was able to see the support system I had and use them to continue to grow."
