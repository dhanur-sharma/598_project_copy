        "Summarize the following story in first person: 2018 was a whirlwind. I was getting married. The planning and preparations were may more intense than expected. Who would have thought planning a wedding would take so much work? I really didn't expect it despite what everyone told me. I remember going Wedding dress shopping with my mom and sisters. The day was perfect. I wasn't sure what kind of dress I wanted, all I knew is I wanted to look fabulous. I had tried on several dresses when finally I put on THE Dress. Everyone agreed, and I cried happy tears knowing that this was going to be the best day ever. Cake testing was fun as well. Not to mention making decorations with my little sister who tends to be bossy. But we got through that. The rehearsal dinner was a hoot. Everyone showed up on time, and we rehearsed like it was the real thing. The dinner was delicious and I was ready to get married to my man. That night I cried happy tears knowing this was my future. I was so lucky. The actual day went by so fast but was so beautiful. My favorite part was getting to dance with my mother, who didn't expect it. It was a special mother daughter dance. I wanted to show her how much I appreciated her work being a great single mom!"
