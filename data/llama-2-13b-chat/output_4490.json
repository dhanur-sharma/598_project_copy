        "Summarize the following story in first person: It happened about 3 months ago when I was driving back from work to my apartment. I was on the most busy road that day near my apartment and there was a lot of traffic. I should have been more careful but I did not see this coming. It was around 3pm right after I got off of work and I was trying to rush home so I could eat and go to sleep. I stopped at the left turn with my Honda accord and was waiting for an opening. I thought I saw an opening and commited, thats when I was blind sided from the right with 2 cars (1 truck and 1 sedan). It was so terrifying and the noise from the metal was deafening. It almost knocked me out and I had emotionally been damaged from the car crash. I was luckily not hurt but emotionally I was terrified and I couldn't breath right for a couple of days. I had a couple of lashes on my head that needed stiches from the glass but overall I was fine. I learned to be more careful after that and to double check my surroundings before committing. The day after, I had to call the insurance companies and explain everything that happened. I had a boost in insurance rates and was pretty pissed off, but in the end it was my fault. After that, I took a long break from work and tried to recouperate myself from the physical and mental damage. In the end, I took it on the chin like a man and moved on."
