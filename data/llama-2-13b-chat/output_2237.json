        "Summarize the following story in first person: I can still remember receiving my personal invitation from my nephew to be a part of his high school graduation. I have a very small family since it is just my sister and me. While I have no kids, she has two boys. Therefore, we are a close knit family. Of course, I eagerly accepted and booked my tickets for the trip to Washington, D.C. I live in Florida so I only get to see my family a few times a year. When the day arrived that I would travel to D.C., I was very excited. The flight went very quickly and before I knew it, I was there. My nephew was not able to be at the airport to greet me since he was just arriving that day from camp. I waited patiently all day until it was time for my sister and I to pick him up. I can still remember when he first saw me. He ran to where I was and literally picked me up off the ground in a huge hug. It made my heart happy. He has always been special to me since he was my very first nephew. The day of his graduation arrived and it was bittersweet. I was so proud of how far he had come."
