        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last month was very interesting to say the least.  Aside from our day to day struggles and hurdles we were hit with 24 hours of shock.  Late one evening I got word that a good friend from childhood had passed away.  This came as a big surprise, he was doing so much better lately.  He had overdosed on Heroin a few years ago and it put him in a bad spot.  He died, but was revived.  When he came back he had brain damage and was stuck in a wheel chair.  He died of a heroin overdose.  Not even 12 hours later I awoke to find that another childhood friend had died.  Again, heroin was to blame.  He suffered with addiction to the drug for years and it finally took him away.  It was a rough few days following.  We just had the final service this last weekend.  The first friend who passed had family who was ashamed of the way he left the world and didn't want to have a formal service.  All of us as friends couldn't accept that.  We held a funeral service for him on Friday, better late than never.  Many friends showed up from around the state.  I thought it was so special, we ARE family and we were there until the bitter end.  Beautiful."
