        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 3 months ago, I started training with the US census Bureau. The whole entire things was honestly a mess. We had TWO supervisors for some odd reason, and neither seemed to know what was happening. They were both nice and helpful, but neither had been given enough information to adequately do their job. They were pretty much given a script, and told to stick to the script word for word. Each day lasted 8 hours, and we did get paid for it. But it was designed by a completely incompetent team. We didn't know how many months we would be working, how much we were getting paid, or even where we were working. Whenever we had a question that our supervisors didn't know, they would have call seattle, and wait for a half hour until they heard back from them. And the computer situation was also a mess. It took two entire days just to get our laptops that were given to us to use on the job, setup. It was entirely basic stuff like how to sign in, but we had to do it step by step, and could NOT skip ahead. Then when we had to do payroll, that took an additional two days just to teach us how to submit our time online. We were told repeatedly we could not go over 8 hours a day, 40 hours a week, and that it would never happen. Then it happened the very next week. It was all a mess, and entirely not worth it if I'm being completely honest."
