        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was a summer night, a beautiful night, not too hot (very rare for Wisconsin), clearest night in a long time. My boyfriend(let's call him R.) and I had the house to ourselves, so we just had some Asian food and enjoyed the silence. It was one of my favorite parts of that relationship; being able to just sit with a person and not say much and still be completely at peace. No obligation to say something funny, be smooth, or entertain. Just peaceful bliss. His family got home eventually and I got to enjoy that for a couple hours. At some point R. and I decided to go see a movie, and The Fault in Our Stars had just been released earlier that week, which we were very excited about. We had a nice long drive (he's a terrible navigator and we got lost), but still got to the movie in plenty of time. The movie itself was fantastic. We laughed, we cried, we held hands; it was beautiful. Also, it was the first movie I had seen on an 8k screen, which I tried to explain to his, but... that's not important. We loved it. Fast forward twenty minutes after the movie. We get back to his house, get out of the car, and he just lays down in the soft grass in his front yard to look at the stars. I think, \"Oh, this is cheesy as hell, but what the fuck, I can deal...\". We laid there for a good ten minutes, hand in hand, knees brushing, exchanging soft words among the silence of their quiet little village. After a time, I just felt the urge. I needed to kiss this boy. It was too perfect. The stars were clear in the sky, the moment was right. And then, for the first time, I leaned in and I got the kiss right. It was the most magical moment I have ever experienced. It literally could not have been more picturesque. I didn't think this date would go well because of what he was wearing, but I then saw his eyes, which made me think it was stupid to focus on what he was wearing."
