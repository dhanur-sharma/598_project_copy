        "Summarize the following story in first person: wow...i have been waiting YEARS to see The Stones in concert live.  Their tickets are so high or they are playing so far from where i live, and now, I actually am holding in my hand, 2 tickets ON THE FLOOR to see them that I WON!! I cannot believe it.  Problem is the tickets are for NYC and I am in Mass.  Im kinda afraid of NYC..never been to a city like that before. I mean i have been to Boston a time or two, but NY. i Don't know.  A friend is going with me, and we can take the train in so it wont be too much money, but still, neither of us have been there so we will need to figure out how to get to the stadium from where our train stops, and do this without getting mugged!  So many stories i hear about that city!  I already super nervous...but super excited at the same time!!We have maps and GPS on our phone.  We have extra money in case cabs or uber is needed.  We will pack snacks in back packs.  Hmm i wonder if they allow those in the arena? I better look that up!  This is going to be quite a trip!  I can hardly wait!"
