        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last week my wife's water broke while we were at home eating dinner. She went into labor and I was running around like a crazy man trying to find her bag.  I finally got her into the car and headed to the hospital.  The hospital is only like ten minutes from my house, but on the way there, we got stopped in a line of cars that was waiting to let a family of ducks cross the road. My wife was trying to do her breathing, but kind of freaking out because she kept saying the baby was going to come any minute.  We finally got moving after like 10 minutes. I rushed her into the hospital where they immediately checked her and took her to the delivery room because there was no time to wait. The baby came so fast after that. My wife lost more blood than the doctor was comfortable with so we spent two days in the hospital. They felt it was okay to let me take my wife and baby boy home again after that. The nurses were really friendly. The doctor made sure to check everything. The baby was bigger than we thought he would be. He was 9 pounds. Even though having to wait for a group of ducks was awful at the time, it is such a great story to remember the whole thing knowing that my wife and son are just fine."
