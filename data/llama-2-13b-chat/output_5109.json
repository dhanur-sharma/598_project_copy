        "Summarize the following story in first person: 4 months ago, my mother quit smoking. I know this can be hard. I've seen others who quit and don't succeed. I am here always to support her and know this far in how hard it is for her. She smoked for many many years. I saw her shaking out of no where. I asked her was she ok. She then says, \"yes, i'm ok, just promise me you won't smoke\". I assured her I wouldn't. I have in the past 4 months watch her be angry. I've watched her be hyper active. It is scary to think that smoking is this important. So far, my mother and I are getting through this one day at a time. I love my mother and will be there til the end. Mom, you can do it!"
