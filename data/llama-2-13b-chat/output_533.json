        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 3 weeks ago, I had to do a short introduction ceremony for my RCIA class during Sunday Mass. The ceremony was probably one of the best events last year at church. I met a lot of new people and they were all amazing. They all seemed very nice and friendly, and we even had brunch together afterwards. One of the people I met was Sharon. She recently graduated from college and was super cool. We both have a lot of similar interests and she even likes basket weaving. Definitely have to show her my collection of baskets one day. Another person I met was Byron. He was Jewish and recently converted. Apparently he's also a famous DJ and has the same music taste as me. I'm planning on going to one of his shows next week! I'm not really a fan of clubs but hopefully it will be a fun time. Anyways, brunch was pretty good. We went to a Greek restaurant that I've never been to and had the best gyros. It was so good I wanted to order more but I'm on a diet so I couldn't. However, I'm definitely planning on going there a lot more and trying out some more dishes."
