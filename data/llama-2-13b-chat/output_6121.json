        "Summarize the following story in first person: My mother recently passed away after a long battle with lung cancer. It was very hard to say goodbye but at least we had time to spend together the last few years as the cancer was not sudden and was caught early enough to treat and extend her life. My mom fought a hard fight and did not let cancer take her easily. In fact she was fighting to the very end and never let cancer define her life. I was able to be with her throughout this journey and am grateful that she was able to spend her last few years with me and my family. My daughter will always remember her grandma as a fighter and someone who never gave up.  Every time the doctors told us the end was near my mom fought through and bought herself another few months. It got to the point though that the pain was obviously wearing her down both mentally and physically and myself and my wife had to let her know it was ok to let go. That was probably the hardest part of the whole thing, telling my own mother that it was ok to stop fighting so she could be at peace. We knew that if she thought we were not ready to let go that she would keep fighting until she had nothing left. She came home from the hospital for her last few weeks and we will always cherish that time we spent as a family together. Now that she is gone I am still sad and miss her greatly but am glad that she is at peace and free of pain. She taught my daughter what it means to fight and to not give up regardless of the odds. She also taught us how to let go and say goodbye. Her funeral was not a sad affair as we gathered all of her family and friends and had a party to remember who she was as a person and what she truly meant to us all."
