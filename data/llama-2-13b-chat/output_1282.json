        "Summarize the following story in first person: Today I went to meet another newborn. With flowers for mom and gift for baby in hand, I made my way through the hospital hallways, recalling the memories of the birth of my own baby, my now two year old and husband walking alongside me. In the past few months, the baby fever has overwhelmed me, made me giddy with excitement, and brought me to tears. After a very difficult and traumatic labor and delivery two years back, I never thought I would want another one so soon. But here I was walking in the hallways, past the nursery, the faint echo of brand-new baby cries lingering into my heart. It seemed like everyone near and dear to me was either pregnant, or just had a brand new baby, something I long for so bad. But I know, realistically, right now would not be the ideal time for cradles and bibs. That time, I know, is so close, but seemingly so far away. There are things that must be done to prepare; the unchecked list runs through my head every single day. My body needs to be 20-30 pounds lighter. We need to figure out a few financial things. I need to get my dentist work done first. I need to read all the books and do all the research.  My husband, also with his own worries and fears, needs to be on the same page. Somehow my many \"needs\" have put my one major \"want\" on hold, and it's resulted in a sin called envy. I greet another tired mama, stare at another sweet sleeping babe, and hand in hand with my husband, walk out the door. We get into the car, and I let out a heavy, longing sigh. My husband, looks me straight in the eyes. \"What?\" I ask. He doesn't speak, just gives me a small smile. We speak to each other without speaking. I smile back as tears fall down my cheeks. I close my eyes and the list appears. Check. My heart is content."
