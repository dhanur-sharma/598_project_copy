        "Summarize the following story in first person: The only memorable event that occurred in the last six months was my first day volunteering at the local Humane Society. I have quite a bit of free time since I am disabled so I thought I'd put some of it to good use. I really enjoy being around animals and they needed volunteers at the Humane Society so I thought it was a perfect fit. I had never done this before, so I wasn't sure what I was getting into but I didn't know that that particular Humane Society treats animals very well and is a no-kill shelter. So I went down there and there were five or six other volunteers there and we had to go through a brief training class about how to handle dogs. After that was over some of us stuck around and took a tour of the whole place and check out some of the animals that were there. Not only did they have dogs but they had lot of cats and kittens as well as other small pets like rabbits, guinea pigs, and even a rat. Since I was already down there, I thought I would go ahead and take a dog out for a spin. I found a really cute pitbull by the name of Dolly. Most people think that pitbulls are mean but Dolly was and anything but. She was one of the friendliest dogs I ever met. If I was able to have a dog at my apartment, I would have adopted her for sure. We went on a walk in the adjacent park and stop a couple of times to look at flocks of birds or people having a picnic or we just sat by the pond. Every time we sat down Dolly would start jumping up and licking my face all over. It took me a little bit together to stop but eventually, she did. She was very animated and it looked like she was even smiling during this whole time. I've taken plenty of other dogs out for walks but so far, Dolly has been my favorite for sure. She wasn't at the shelter very long since everybody enjoyed her company. She got adopted pretty quickly. I was sad to see her go but there were plenty of other dogs that I could take for walks and play with in the shelter's backyard."
