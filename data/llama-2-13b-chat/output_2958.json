        "Summarize the following story in first person: In relation to the story written above, my car is still a piece of garbage. I had to call several different finance dealers just to find out that what the dealership did to me was completely illegal! They sold me a car when I was of age but did not let me sign for the car. They had my sister in law and my mother sign for it. Which is called a split sale. It is illegal to do that for someone who is of age. The only exception is a parent or guardian buying a car for their child. This means that I am driving a car I do not even own. This dealership has royally screwed with my finances. They are charging me 21% interest on this car. They finance was for right at sixteen thousand and I will end up paying over forty two thousand for this car. I am appalled that someone could do this and still sleep soundly at night. Now I have to refinance this car with either my sister in law or my mother with my name so that I can eventually just have my name on the car. Some companies have found sympathy with my situation and are willing to work on a better interest rate with me. I am at least thankful for the fact that I have a car at all."
