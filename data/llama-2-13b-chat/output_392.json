        "Summarize the following story in first person: The day was perfect.  Off to the Island, Mackinac that is. We both lived in the area for thirty years and had not ever visited the island even though it was less then and hour a way. My wife and I had talked for years of visiting the Island.  Now off we went. The fairy ride over was a little rough I was concerned because my wife did not like boats. The first thing I noticed about the Island was it smelled of horse crap.  The next I noticed was the people.  There were bicycles whipping between the horses and the people.  The first thing we did was get tickets to the butterfly house. Then we trekked to the top of a huge hill to see the Fort.  After the Fort the butterfly house. There were thousands of live Butterflies everywhere. After this we were both tired, only there for and hour and are legs felt like rubber. Fate was with us and we existed the house there was a horse taxi right there. So off to the Grand Hotel. A nice place but disappointing in the fact they charge people ten dollars just to walk on the grounds. Off to eat after that then shopping. My wife surprised me by not buying much of anything until we reached a shop that took Western Picture of you dressed in Western garb. This was something she always wanted. So I dressed up as a cowboy and she as a bar wench and we had our picture. This thrilled her which thrilled me as well. All in all the trip will be something we always remember. And we have a picture to prove it."
