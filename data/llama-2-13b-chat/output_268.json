        "Summarize the following story in first person: Another day of stress and work. I thought working at my uncle's job would be my dream job and fun, but man that was a mistake. I thought of the good idea to promote the work, but that turned into a terrible dream and nightmare. My uncle put all the blame on me for this and this didn't end well. I ended up quitting and don't go back to decision. I really wish I didn't work there. It sounded like a great idea at first, but man. My relationship may take time to turn up with my uncle, but until then I will have to do little here and there to make it better. I wish again I didn't get this job. I think about my uncle a lot now and hope we are cool again like before. This really hurts me, and my family. My dad and uncle are at war now because of this big mistake. I don't know how it could so wrong and not right at all. It wasn't that much money, but in reality it was the worst idea the more I think about it. Another day closer to being closer with my uncle. I hope this happens. Another day diary, another day."
