        "Summarize the following story in first person: March 5th 2019 my friend and I decided to go down to Miami to enjoy spring break. Little did I know that this spring break would change my life forever. So my friend and I decided hey let's try out the clubs to ight since we're here in Miami. So I said Alright, and we went. So were dancing doing our normal thing and a girl walked up to me and asked me to dance. I said yes ofcourse and danced the night away. After the club we exchange numbers and began our relationship from there. Calling and texting and eventually I asked her out on a date, it was awesome and the most amazing part about it was that we had alot of things in common, for example I loved animals and sports and so did she. So our 1 date turned into 4 dates and by the time I knew it we had gotten very close. She was even coming out with me and my friends like she was just part of the group, it was a really nice time. Everything was going absolutely great however there was one problem. She was from England and only here in Miami on vacation. So the day that she had to leave we said our goodbyes and it was very tough for the both of us. However we promised each other that we would always stay in touch. We even spoke above making arrangements to see each other over the holidays. So in the end I feel like I have something good to look forward to in my future."
