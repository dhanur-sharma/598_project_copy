        "Summarize the following story in first person: This story took place within the last week, however it was many years in the making and I have endured many trials and tribulations along the way to say the very least.  Many years ago a girl opened her heart to me, she told me things she said she had never told another soul, she felt that she could trust me more so than any other person in her life. She meant the world to me, my whole soul lit up the moment she entered the room.  I felt myself really falling for her personality, her smile, her laugh. I was very honored that we were able to share time together, it really meant something to me and I hope that it had meant a lot to her as well.  When she told me that she was moving cross country, I was heart-broken. I truly thought that she would be in my life forever and yet that was not the case at all.  She had been assigned to a job which would take her away from me and possibly to new countries and new adventures. I might never see her again and I felt that was almost too much for me to bear. We did keep in touch, and like I suspected, contact became less and less until it was almost gone completely. I went on with my life, found other people to spend my time with. Dated, and dated some wonderful people, but none really compared to her. I found she was on my mind, if only in the back of my mind as the gold standard to which anyone I met was compared against. It was definitely difficult to compare and my relationships always suffered as a consequence of it. Then one day, just last week my life changed forever. I heard it first, that magical laugh that always captivated me. I had to seek the source of the sound. Although many years had passed, I could remember it like it was yesterday and so many feelings came flooding back.  When I turned around I discovered it was her - it was really her! She was standing there a huge smile on her lips. It look me by surprise I never thought I would see her again and yet there was was standing before me. We talked for hours as though we had never been apart. To find out that she is moving back to our town, that she is single and still thinks of me as I had thought of her is almost a stroke of magic. I look forward to the years to come and hope they are just as magical as the very first day I laid eyes upon her."
