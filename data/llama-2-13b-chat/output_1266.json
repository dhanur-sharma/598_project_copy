        "Summarize the following story in first person: I finally was able to go on vacation with my husband and only my husband. We had not been on a vacation alone in quite a while due to choosing our children first. These days were so exiceting yet scary and I will never forget it. It happend two weeks ago. We decited to visit the truly beautiful island of Jamaca. This place is so amazing it is a real dream come true to be there. The water is perfectly blue. We stayed in a hut on the water and the nightime sounds are just so great. All you hear is the calm night and the water slowly moving by. What does this woman think of? Her child, I thought that if I got away I would be nothing but happy, but I missed my kids the whole time. All and all I think I will not do this again. I love my kids too much and things would be better with them. The next time I go on vacation I will take my children becuase they mean the world to me. I still had a good time in Jamaca wih my husband, I will never forget it. I hope to bring my kids here someday."
