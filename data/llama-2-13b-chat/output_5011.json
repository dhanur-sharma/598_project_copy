        "Summarize the following story in first person: My boyfriend and I have been together for several years now. I thought he was going to ask me to marry him. Instead, about two months ago he told me that he fell out of love with me and that he thought we should separate. I have been devastated. My emotional roller coaster has been mostly down. I have had thoughts of suicide. I know that killing myself over a guy is stupid, but they continue to come. I don't have any support in my life. My boyfriend was my entire support system. My parents have been out of my life for several years. I cannot turn to the since both of them are druggies on skid row. I am just so sad and alone right now. I'm thinking to try to go to a support group, but just cannot figure out where to turn. I'm glad that I do not own a gun because that would have made it too easy to do it. I do not want to die, but I cannot imagine a life without him."
