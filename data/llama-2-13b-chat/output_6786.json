        "Summarize the following story in first person: I got a phone call back in July of 2019 that my grandmother was sick and in the hospital. The news was grim as doctors told my extended family members that her organs were failing. I immediately got off the phone and started to look at flights with my husband. Money is tight in our house as my husband is the only one bringing income into our home but we bought a plane ticket to Phoenix so I could see her once last time and say my goodbyes. I reflected and remembered so many wonderful times with my grandmother while I was flying from Atlanta to Phoenix. I was expecting the worst when I got off the flight but in fact my grandmother held on while I was in the air. I met up at the hospital with my parents and my grandmothers organs were back to almost fully functioning. We were able to chat, laugh and remember so many wonderful memories with her as she was awake and coherent. I spent four amazing days with my grandmother in the hospital before having to head back home. I was so touched by how my father helped her in and out of her bed and how he held her hand the entire time we were with her. It was truly so sweet and genuine. With such a grim diagnosis in the middle of July, my grandmother held on for another week and a half before peacefully leaving this earth surrounded by family. I find great comfort knowing that I was able to see her and talk with her. I also feel so at peace that she wasn't in any pain when she passed away. I hope that I can live such a long and healthy life as she did."
