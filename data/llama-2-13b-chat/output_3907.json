        "Summarize the following story in first person: On this day in June, my husband and I, along with a couple that we are very close friends with, were in Colorado for a four day weekend. We wanted to see Garden of the Gods and decided the best way to do this was to take a Segway tour. Although my husband is in moderate stage Alzheimer's, we had done it a few years ago with this same couple in Chicago, and we thought he could probably handle it. We talked with the tour guide/instructor, and told him the situation. He worked patiently with my husband and concluded that he would be able to do ride the Segway safely. My friend's husband was super sweet with my husband, watching over him to make sure he was doing okay and guiding him throughout the day. The tour through the majestic rocks was absolutely breathtaking. The weather was a perfect 80 degrees and breezy. The views of the rock formations and the mountains were amazing. We took lots of pictures that turned out fantastic. Our companions were wonderful. We laughed a lot, along with a lot of oohs and aahs. We all said we would love to do it again. Of all the things we did while in Colorado, this was my favorite. Riding the Segways was so much fun, we made the perfect choice for seeing Garden of the Gods."
