        "Summarize the following story in first person: Six months ago I planted the most beautiful garden. Planting this garden was a very important event in my life because it marked the anniversary of my father's death. My father always wanted to plant a garden but never had the time and died a lot earlier than we planned. What my father had planned to do was plant a garden in his retirement, which he never made it to. In honor of my father's memory I planted the best garden I have ever seen! It had everything. I planted green beans in in the northeast corner, my fathers absolute favorite! I even planted some garlic so I could make his favorite dish, all with ingredients right from my garden! There was everything. More colors than you could imagine. The reddest of red tomatoes. The yellowest of yellow peppers. And the most purple purple you have ever seen could be found right on my eggplants! And oh boy was it green! Every shade of green from the darkest to the most pale found it's way onto the leaves of the plants growing in my garden! Now that the summer has died down I am enjoying the fruits of my labor. Not just the many vegetables I have grown, but there is something extra special. Something that is only ready when the harvest begins to come in. That's right; pumpkins! Big, bright, orange pumpkins, of all different sizes; I must have grown over a dozen of them! And let me tell you this; they faired much better than the watermelons I tried to grow this year! Some may say my garden might have been a little over ambitious for my first one; but you know what? My dad would be proud. It was his garden, whether he was here to enjoy it or not! I bet he looked down on me while I was working on it smiling, just glad he didn't have to do all the work!"
