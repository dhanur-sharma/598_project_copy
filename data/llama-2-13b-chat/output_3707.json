        "Summarize the following story in first person: It\u2019s been two months and I still can\u2019t get over the Fact that I\u2019m a homeowner!! It took sooo long to save up for our down payment. We spent what felt like forever saving up money and cutting expenses on other areas. I\u2019m really proud of what we accomplished. Last night, my parents threw us a surprise housewarming party!! We couldn\u2019t believe it. We got some great gifts, but more importantly it was so awesome to see our family and friends come together and support us. They are truly amazing. I can\u2019t wait to see all the surprises this home has in store for us. I can just picture turning the spare bedroom into a nursery, or Brandon installing a swing set in the yard. I look forward to cooking Christmas and thanksgiving dinners in the kitchen. I know we have so many exciting memories to come here. It just feels so good to finally be able to say that we accomplished our goal. We will set another financial goal soon but for now we are just basking in the newness I\u2019d this situation. We praise God for making this happen and blessing us beyond all measure! And we pray that he uses this home to bring our family closer to Him, foster fellowship, and build love and community. We are so lucky."
