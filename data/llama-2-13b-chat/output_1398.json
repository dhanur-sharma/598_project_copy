        "Summarize the following story in first person: My last living uncle, who was 84 years old passed away after a short hospital stay. He had gotten sick with pneumonia, and was admitted to our local hospital. Unfortunately, we live in a small town, and the doctors don't seem to be the smartest. They released him to go home after two days. He called me the next day after he came home, and he was spitting up blood and needed to go back to the hospital. This time, his breathing was so bad that he almost didn't make it to the adjoining town, which has a much larger hospital. He was sent by ambulance and it was immediately determined after arrival that both lungs were full of pneumonia. They also discovered two spots on one of his lungs. At first they did have him stabilized, but he continued to spit up blood and it got much worse over the next couple of days. The white hospital wash clothes were turned completely red. The doctors started testing him for a much worse type of pneumonia, called \"fungal pneumonia\". We never found out the results of that test because he passed away before the results came back. It was very sad for me to watch, because this incredibly active man that truly loved and enjoyed life, was brought to his death bed in less than a week. The thing that really awed everyone, was that my aunt passed away on the very same day one year before. They both died on the same day, one year and thirty minutes apart. They had been married for 40 years. Some say that he just died of a broken heart."
