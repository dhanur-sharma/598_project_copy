        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 3 months ago I reconnected with an elementary school classmate. He messaged me on Facebook because he thought I was going to live about an hour away from where he was moving. Unfortunately, I moved again and we will be much farther away when he moves. We haven't seen each other in over 30 years. We have been speaking to each other almost every day. I don't think we spoke more than a few words to each other as kids. It is funny how we have this connection.  Our values are very similar. I am not sure if he will be attracted to me. I am taking a leap of faith and I will meet him at the end of the month.  I want to say he is out of my league in some ways. I know he likes model type women which I am not and I told him that. I hope he can get past the physical looks and can enjoy what we have. I am taking a chance at having my heart broken, but if I don't, I will always wonder if we could have had something. I can't wait to finally meet him in person."
