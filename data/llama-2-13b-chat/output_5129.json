        "Summarize the following story in first person: In the past two months i have almost attend at least a ten job interviews,but all in vain no good results and i did not reap anything good after sowing good things. got frustrating  and thought to quit .But i understood that i had to flow with the current to find success rather than fighting the current, which turned out to be useless .So i started trying and getting adjusted to people who interviewed me and correct my mistakes ,and learn from wrongs and i started to get confidence and i worked more on faults , and started to improve and i soon got a good placement in a good company which i did not expect .I got very well with the companies environment, and it was very cool .I was doing well in my jobs and my senior were happy with that and everything was going very well .Recently I had a call from a pastor friend who wanted to get his church out of a portable situation and into a new facility. We had talked about the move several times, and on this particular day he was down the wire. His church had given at unbelievably sacrificial levels, but he was still at least 6 figures short of his goal. Yet they had a building deal in front of them that they could move on now before costs escalated beyond what they could afford. He asked me what I thought. I asked more questions. The answers really didn\u2019t help me get much clarity at all, despite my friend\u2019s best intentions. I asked him what other wise people he and I both knew were saying. He said everyone thought it was pushing the known limits. I said I tended to agree. We talked some more. So what advice did I end up giving him? I told him:I think this will be spectacular. It will either be spectacularly wonderful or a spectacular failure. And I don\u2019t know which."
