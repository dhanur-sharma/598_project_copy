        "Summarize the following story in first person: I had had a hot day and was about to leave for home. The day was good and the game was such a relieve since  we had beaten our rivals. We had awaited for this clash for more than a year and it was time to prove to them that we were unbeatable. My team was well prepared and with our Captain in good form, we were sure of victory.  Earlier that day i had a bad feeling of unwelnes. My head was throbbing like it was going to burst. I had a feeling like i was sick.  All the same the game started well and we were able to have a very early lead with one goal to nill in the first half. Our coach was enthusiastic and hopeful that we were to win.    On the second half, they equalized and that is when i new that football was like a game of cards and the tables can change at any given time We had to do something. Time was not on our side. We had to change the attack pattern and do it fast. We  needed one more goal to make the difference. Ten minutes to full time, Joe sent me a cross that changed the game. I was in a good position to score but chose to pass it to the Captain who was in a better position than me. It was a smooth pass but i was attacked from behind and fell to the ground. The Captain had netted it and we were on the lead again. My head was throbbing and i was substituted. The game ended well. We won. Back at home and i was feeling better. I go downstairs to grab a sugary drink thinking that is what I needed for a hot summer day when I was feeling massively dehydrated. I just throw it all up. I found it hard to stand and even walk and this progression alerted me it was time to go to a hospital."

I spent the next two days at the hospital recovering and was lucky enough to be discharged. I realized that I had been so caught up in the excitement of the game that I had ignored my own body's signals and almost paid the ultimate price. I vowed to always listen to my body and never prioritize a game over my health again."
