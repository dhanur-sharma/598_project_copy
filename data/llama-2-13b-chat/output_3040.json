        "Summarize the following story in first person: My memorable moment in the last few months has to be the day my ex-wife came back into my life. We had a rocky past and since we have split up, we both have moved onto other relationships. Recently, we were both single and she reached out to me and discussed all of our past to try to reconcile. I have so much love for her and by her simply coming back it lit a fire under me to do better for her. About 1 month ago she had sent me a message on instagram and asked if we could meet. This was a huge reaching out and it instantly made me happy and all the old feelings came rushing back in. I was delighted to hear from her and I missed her so much but, I was still suspicious. As the weeks went by we spent more and more time together until we decided to get back together. This made me so happy and I feel like this was a life changing event. I feel like I wont ever forget about this day because it was a second chance for me and that's so important. I was so happy to receive her back into my life and it's probably the most memorable moment in my life to this date. She opened up her heart and exposed all she was thinking for the past 3 years. I find out she is still the same witty person I fell in love with all those years ago. I was surprised she still remembered so many things about me and we had so many things in common. One night we stayed up all night and drove down the shore to watch the sunrise on the beach, we talked about our most intimate feelings and how we could be better for each other. This moment touched me so greatly that I wanted her to love me more. In all I love her so much and I'm so happy I had another chance at happiness"
