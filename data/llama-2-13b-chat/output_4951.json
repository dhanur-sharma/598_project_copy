        "Summarize the following story in first person: I am currently recovery from generalized anxiety disorder. I. had slightly anxiety before in high school where I developed a fear that I would be single forever and not find a husband. I had my ups and downs with it all the way when I entered grad school that was not debilitating. Then on October 2018 it hit me the hardest. I developed debilitating anxiety over the smallest things. My first thoughts were that I may be gay which scared me for some reason because I know I not. There it went on to where I could not watch romantic movies or high school romance (which I love to watch) because I did not want to have single anxiety. Even when I was happy it would not last long because I felt like it would be stripped away from me. For instance thoughts of my parent dying. Im 23 and my parents are only 50. They have a while and they are highly responsible. The odds are quite slim but sometimes the fear feels so real. I would have panic attacks in the middle of the night several days throughout the week over these dark thought I sought counseling immediately and that has helped me greatly where I had to slowly change my thought process into a positive . I am now in recovery where my body sometimes misses the anxiety because its been a part of my life for about a year and I have slight relapses every now and then. I used to have weekly sessions with my counselors, but I developed the tools and actions where I only go check-ups. Sort of like visiting a doctor."
