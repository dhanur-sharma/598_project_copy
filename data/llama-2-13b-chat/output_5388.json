        "Summarize the following story in first person: My sister died on May of 2018 (not 1018), and we get together every year for a memorial. This past year, (June of 2019) we all met at a Greek restaurant in Philadelphia. I live in Philly and people came from Pittsburgh and Allentown as well. There were maybe 15-17 of us. We actually met for lunch and then we all went to a church close by that some one was a member of for desert, coffee and to talk. My niece was there of course as well as my daughter and some close friends. I didn't care for the food at the restaurant, but, that wasn't the reason that we gathered, so it didn't matter. It was a hot day, and we walked from the restaurant to the church (hard for me because I recently had knee surgeries). I made sun catchers (because my sister loved the sun)  for everyone as well as a box in which we all wrote memories of my sister and placed them in the box. The sun catchers actually made a few people cry.  What surprised me is that it seemed like we didn't talk about my sister all that much. I mean the mood was somber, and we all knew why we were there, but, it became a little bit awkward. It was good to see everyone, and we are going to do it every year. She had a hard life and it was suicide. I wish I'd have been closer to  her at the end, and maybe I could have prevented what happened."
