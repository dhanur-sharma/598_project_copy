        "Summarize the following story in first person: One of the best experiences I have ever had was five months ago.   We were all miserable and had low moral after being laid off of our job the day before.  We decided to go on a girls trip to cheer ourselves up.   The last thing any of us expected was for to get stuck in the elevator at the hotel we were staying at    We were headed to the pool and the elevator stopped between floors.  All we had on was our bathing suits , t'shirt, shorts and flip flops.  My friend had brought her bag and had a bottle Fireball Schnapps hidden in the bottom.  She started to  have major anxiety due to the small space and pulled out the bottle and took a drink.  We all then took a drink and another and within in a few minutes we started feeling goofy and relaxed.  The elevator was on the outside of the building and had glass all around the backside.  You could see the pool area and the the elevators right next to us.  There were three  guys in the elevator to our right.  They were stuck also.  They couldn't hear us and we just tried to communicate with hand signals.  They were laughing and having as much fun as we were.  We couldn't wait to get out of the elevator and hang out with them at the pool.    Before we knew it we were engaged in a game of charades with the guys next to us.  It made it more fun because we could only communicate with body language and trying to read lips.  I don't think we ever laughed so hard.  Who knew you could have that much fun stuck in an elevator for a couple hours.  Needless to say the elevators started moving again and my friends and I continued hanging out with the guys down at the pool.  It was definitely a time we will never forget."
