        "Summarize the following story in first person: I roomed with a fellow caregiver friend of mine. We had not met before. It was a perfect time to get together under a different situation then we normally interacted in. We hung out during the day by the pools and we had so much fun. We drank and laughed and took photos. I introduced her to old friends of mine. My friend goes to bed early so i would spend my evenings with my old concert friends. We caught up and shared stories and laughs. I loved catching up with people as well as finally connecting with some I have known a long time but not met. People came from all over the world and it was so amazing. I ate lots of good food and drink. The music was amazing. The concerts were amazing. They did costume night each night and that was a lot of fun. Lots of glow paint and stuff. Band members walked around a bit and that was fun to have them interact with us in that way. The DJ at the pool at night was out of this world."
