        "Summarize the following story in first person: Dear diary,It has been a painful three months, so I hadn't had the opportunity to write in you as the events happened. I will recount what unfolded below.\"Dad is dying\". These words made me sick to my stomach as my brother called me. He had never been a part of my life, but I was always fond of the memories I had with him when I was a child up to the age of seven, when the divorce happened. This man who I missed, but barely knew. And now he wasn't long for the world. I made it to the hospice they kept him at. Coming into the room, I stared at the frail figure reclining on the bed before me. A well of sadness for the pitiable man came up through me, and I pulled up a seat beside him. We talked when he came to, and during the next two months we talked for the most we had ever had, even more than we had when we were a family. I didn't want to bring up his mortality as I imagined he would have wanted to talk about other things, so I did my best to get to know the man, his passions, his regrets, his proudest moments. I had gotten back to the hotel where I stayed when I got the call that he had passed away. I didn't feel much emotion at the time because I had expected it. Then came another call, a frantic one.\"Where's Dad?\" Did they lose the body? Before I could respond, \"Oh I was at the wrong room.\" My brother had been drinking. The funeral had been set for last week, open casket. But furiously, they had a problem with the embalming, so closed casket it was going to be. At the end of the funeral, as the other pallbearers and I went to pick up the coffin, it felt strangely light. Too light, as in empty light. Frantic, we opened up the casket, and Dad was missing. We're still looking for him."

No chance to ask him questions. No chance to let him know how much I forgave him. I'm still looking for him. I don't know if I'll find him. I hope I do. But it's like a part of me is gone, too.\n\n"
