        "Summarize the following story in first person: A memorable event that happened to me in the last six months is when I hosted an event for one of my high school band directors. The event was a dinner to honor him for his years of service as a teacher and mentor. The mayor and other delegates were in attendance. I was on the planning committee and performed the setup and coordination for the event. There were a lot of challenges with the event as our funding for the event was not met. Members of the planning committee stepped up and assisted with the music, entertainment, food, and guest speakers. I assisted with the decor and decorations. During the planning of this event, I was not notified that I had to speak on behalf of the planning committee. Towards to the end of the event, the entire planning committee was called to the stage. I was called out to speak. I was unprepared and nervous as I was not informed that I had to speak. I completely froze. I informed everyone that I would speak later. I was totally embarrassed. I was very upset as I was not notified that I had to speak. I felt defeated. To this day, I still get upset when thinking about this event. I have talked about it with friends and family and have tried to move forward."
