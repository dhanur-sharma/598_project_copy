        "Summarize the following story in first person: 3 weeks ago I was EXTREMELY stressed out--it was my wedding anniversary. Look, I'm not one for formal events. I forget my own birthday sometimes, that's just how it is sometimes. But my husband would never let me hear the end of it if I forgot or I didn't do anything, so I just had to. I didn't have any money--just paid mortgage, didn't want to dip into savings. Husband wouldn't like that at all. My son though, the best kid in the whole world, talked with my friend. And they figured things out for me--I didn't even ask. They gave me the money I needed to take my husband out. My son is only 2 years old and he's already doing things like this for me. When he's an adult, I can't see him not being the best son in the entire universe. Me and my husband went to a nice restaurant, and all went pretty well. He was happy, I was happy. I do owe my friend a treat sometime in the next few months. It's all good, though!"
