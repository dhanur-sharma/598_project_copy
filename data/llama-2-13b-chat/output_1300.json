        "Summarize the following story in first person: I lost my 5 years job for a mistake.  The company was very \u2018sales driven\u2019 and as long as I created good \u2018numbers\u2019 nothing could happen to me. But making sales meant that the people who already joined our clubs didn\u2019t get the attention they needed, and left. I preferred to embrace the existing members instead of the stress of gaining enough new members. To make a long story short, I wasn\u2019t useful for the company anymore (although my clubs gained profit month after month) so I got kicked out of the company in a very bad way. My coworker was not reporting the spendings of projects as she should have been doing. From that time on I promised myself never to give a huge part of my time to a company that doesn\u2019t give a shit about anyone, only themselves, to make lots of money. While sitting at home I decided to start a company so I would be able to do work I love, and to be in total control of what went right and wrong. In the beginning the company didn\u2019t earn much money, so I found a part-time job working 3 days a week, which gave me the opportunity to earn enough money to pay the bills and still have 4 days to work for my own business. But it didn\u2019t work that way. The evenings I was home from the part-time job I wasn\u2019t very productive, which meant that I had to fit all the other stuff (like working on building my company) into the other 4 days, while in the weekends I had lots of assignments. So the actual time I had left to build up my company was reduced to one day a week. In other words: I couldn\u2019t combine it anymore. For me it was clear my company is that one thing I love to do most, so if I want to make it work then I need 150% focus and time. Decision made. I was stupid to trust in her word and not make sure everything was ok."
