        "Summarize the following story in first person: Earlier in the summer, we went on a trip up north. We have a cabin by a lake. There is so much to do there. We like to sailing, jetskiing, etc., even just fishing. A lot of my family stops by to visit and it is really a comfy time. Sometimes, we'll go on a car trip somewhere nearby - maybe 1-2 hours away tops. We spend a lot of the summer away, so we have all the time in the world to do anything we want. One time, me and my brother went on jet skis and went on a trip around the entire lake. We stopped at islands, waded in the water and had a lot of fun. The most surprising thing was when I first got on the jet ski and pressed the gas, I started moving at what felt like 60 miles an hour. I had no idea the controls were so sensitive! All in all, my family is important to me and moments like these are very memorable. i care about making memories with our loved ones. If we don't cherish the time that we have, eventually we'll lose it. So we have to make due with what we have."
