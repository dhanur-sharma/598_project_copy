        "Summarize the following story in first person: One day before my 36th birthday of 2019, I woke up that morning in horrible abdominal pain. I didn't know then but this would be a changing day in my life. Not sure what it was, I spent a good portion of the day in the bathroom crying and throwing up.  My girlfriend convinced me to let her take me to the emergency room and when I got there the pain was so bad the doctor had to give me morphine. The doctor had me do a ton of tests that night and into the next day with the conclusion being that this was a flareup caused by Crones Disease. My jaw dropped. I was then told this is a chronic disease and that my lifestyle would dramatically have to be altered if I am to have any type of life whatsoever. This news hit me like a ton of bricks. No longer would I be able to devour a t-bone steak for dinner or wash it down with alcohol or any type of soda for that matter. I would have to eat healthy and be observant of my meals. I would have to read nutrition labels and stay away from red meats. All of this overwhelmed me as I sat in the hospital bed taking it all in. What I most remember about this day was thinking to myself, \" All of those years my mom told me to eat healthy and I ignored her!\" I have never had to deal with an actual disease I have! This whole event scares me even now. I know this is a chronic disease and its hard to manage now, let alone years down the road."
