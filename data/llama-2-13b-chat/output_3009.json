        "Summarize the following story in first person: I never expected this to turn out this way! When we learned that our friend needed a place to stay for a few days, I was happy to volunteer our home.  I mean I had known her for years so she was almost like family to me.  Who knew it would be a disaster!  You never really know someone unless you live with them is very true!  She kept the TV on all night (loudly), she ate what she wanted from the refridgerator and left quite a mess of chips on the couch and floor.  She did not even volunteer to clean it up.  She helped herself to the milk although she knew we did not have extra left for my children.  Furthermore, she was in the bathroom for quite a while showering in the morning, even thought I told her the time my children needed to be in there to get ready for school  Mind you, she had no where to be that day.  She could have showered at a later time but just did not care.  They were late for the bus and I had to drive them in because of her rudeness.  When I approached her about this, she just shrugged it off.  It is like she was a special guest we needed to cater to, rather than just being thankful she had a place to stay for a few days.  If she acts like this at home, no wonder her boyfriend asked her to move out!  I will NEVER let a \"friend stay in my home like this again?"
