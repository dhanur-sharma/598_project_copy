        "Summarize the following story in first person: I had to recently put down my best friend, my pug/chihuahua mix breed dog, Luke. I had him by my side for around 14 years. He ultimately passed away from a severe progressive case of colon cancer. While I raised him from a puppy, he was also my families dog, but I would say I was the most attached. We went on so many walks together whenever I had free time. He helped me to overcome my social anxiety and shyness by forcing me to go outside and talk to the people we met on our neighborhood walks. I met many current friends through this and became involved in my local school's community because of the connections I made. Luke was an energetic dog and loved his toys, always chewing on something, going through our garbages as a puppy, tearing up tissues, ravaging socks and shoes, anything he could chew up, he did. He developed an odd behavior as he got older, in which every time before he went to bed, he would run upstairs, and go into our linen closet. In this closet we kept all our childhood stuffed animals below the bottom shelf, and he would go up to this box of fluffy animals to kiss them good night. He particular was fond of a fluffy, white, blue eared rabbit. So on the day that the private care veterinarian arrived at our house, we gathered around the kitchen, where Luke was laying on his favorite comfortable red mat on the ground next to his favorite stuff animal bunny. Despite being quite ill, he still mustered up the strength to bark and run around the veterinarian, with his patented dark brown line of fur on his back standing up prominently. Eventually he settled down and became accustomed to the situation. Everyone said their goodbyes, and the veterinarian had me help her locate and stabilize a vein so she could administer the substance to have him pass away peacefully. She gave him the shot of the concoction and within 5 minutes, Luke had passed away silently, with his eyes still open, so we gently closed them. We had him cremated and he now sits in our family room in a small, wooden, decorated box urn next to a hand drawn picture from my sister."
