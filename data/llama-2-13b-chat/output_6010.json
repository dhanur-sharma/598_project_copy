        "Summarize the following story in first person: 6 months ago, I experienced one of the most terrifying yet exhilarating events of my life.  On a whim, my girlfriend and I had decided to take a day trip to the beach. We headed out right before sunrise and by 10 o'clock we were pulling into the parking lot at the beach. For as long as I can remember, I've loved the water. I grew up near the ocean and have always loved to surf and body board. My girlfriend, on the other hand, was much more of a sunbathing type, so usually I would be out in the water on my own. On this particular morning, it was early in the season, so the beach was relatively uncrowded. The waves weren't quite big enough to be worth surfing, so I decided that I would just enjoy the water and possibly catch a few waves body surfing. I dived out into the water, ducking under waves, until finally I got past the point where the waves were breaking. I love to swim beyond the waves because it is so peaceful out there. You can watch the waves break on to the shore and the people on the beach, all while relaxing in the water, surrounded by the peaceful ocean. I was floating on my back for awhile, deep in peaceful thought, when all of a sudden a felt something bump against the bottom of my leg. I was immediately startled, but I am very comfortable in the ocean, so I quickly dismissed it as a piece of debris or clump of seaweed and went back to floating on my back. Just as I started to relax again, I saw what appeared to be a fin surface for just a moment about 8 feet to my left. Once again, due to my experience, I tried to be rational and tell myself that it was most likely a dolphin. Still, I was uncomfortable and started to carefully make my way back to shore. Just as a I passed back over the wave line, I saw the fin again, but this time I could also see the outline of a nearly seven foot shark attached to it. I will never forget the feeling of being that close to a predator of that size and power. All of the Shark Week specials in the world combined wouldn't have been able to prepare me for the feeling of sheer helplessness I experienced as I realized that my life was in the hands of the literal dinosaur just a few feet away from me. My mind instantly froze and instincts fought to take over. Every part of my body was telling me to swim away as fast as I could, but I knew that would only make my situation worse. I calmly moved at a slow and steady pace away from the shark and towards the shore. I decided to train my vision on my girlfriend, and told myself I wouldn't look back. After what felt like hours, I finally got back to shore and ran up to our blanket. That was enough ocean for me for one day, and after telling my girlfriend what had happened, we decided we would spend the rest of the day safe on the sand."
