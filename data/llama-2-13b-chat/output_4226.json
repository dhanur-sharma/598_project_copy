        "Summarize the following story in first person: In august I was asked to be my nephew's godson and it was very touching for me. It was also a big honor because the two of us have been close since he was born. He is two years old and his father is not around to take care of him. He always enjoyed playing with me and loves to imitate anything that I do.  It was a big surprise to me because I did not expect his mother to pick me as she values people with money over character. However in the end I was picked to be the godfather. I want to be able to provide for him as best as possible but at the same time I am afraid to not live up to his mother's standards. I feel like it is a big responsibility to undertake but something that I am willing to give my best shot. I do not want him to grow up with no father figure or no male role model. He gravitated towards me from the start and I feel like he chose me for a reason as well. This is also a good opportunity to prepare myself to be a father one day myself. I can learn what it is like to raise a kid and what to teach them. Sometimes I am afraid that I am not up to the task but he often inspires me to do better. Since then I have been more motivated to overall do better and improve myself. I do plan for the future more and plan to help him out."
