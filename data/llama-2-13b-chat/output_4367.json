        "Summarize the following story in first person: A few months ago, I finally bought the car I have wanted my whole life.  It is a Jeep Wrangler.  A few friends had them when I was growing up, and I always loved riding around with them with the top down or off, and the ability to go riding in the mountains or across creeks, knowing we would make it through with no problems.  I had the opportunity to get one in my late teens, but I instead chose to go to school and then get married.  We worked hard as young newlyweds and had to be practical in our expenditures.  Finally, now at age forty, the right opportunity came for me to get my very own Jeep.  It is black, with a hardtop and is a four door, something that wasn't available when I was younger.   It's perfect for my husband and I, and our small daughter.  Since I bought it, I have been buying all kinds of accessories for it, to customize it and make it a little different from all of the others on the road and trails.  We have big tires, have lifted the suspension, have added red accessories, and some custom lights.  I totally love it.  We have also been able to join a Jeep club, filled with other Jeep owners and lovers in our area.  Every weekend, some members of the club meet together for a cookout or for a trail ride.  So, my car has brought me a brand new group of friends, who are wonderful people I may not have otherwise met.  I'm so happy that I was able to get my Jeep.  I hope to pass it on to my daughter one day."
