        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was invited to my granddaughter's wedding in the Florida. The wedding was going to take place on the beach. Myself and 2 other family members who reside in Michigan decided to drive to the wedding. Because I do not fly on planes due to a fear of flying. We decided to make some fun stops on the way to Florida.  We stopped at a small town store. I bought my granddaughter a very unique gift that was hand made by a woman who was 90 years old. When we arrived in Florida we stayed with a niece in a small quaint house. The wedding was beautiful. I was very surprised that my high school boyfriend from years ago was at the wedding. It was good to see him, and he was doing well. My granddaughter wore my daughter's wedding dress. My granddaughter had some changes made to the dress but it was just as beautiful. My granddaughter even had her pet at the wedding. The wedding was interesting because it was on the beach, and guests were dressed more casual than other wedding that I have been to."
