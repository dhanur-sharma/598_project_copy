        "Summarize the following story in first person: There was a great preparation for my girlfriend's mum birthday. A whole lot of family and friends will be travelling down to celebrate with her for her 60th birthday. I had taken permission from my office for the trip. My wife also cancelled all engagement close to the date. We planned our trip and made all necessary bookings. Her mum stays in a more colder region so we also got ourselves some sweatshirts and cardigan. We got her mum a birthday present also. It was a food processor. We had a smooth flight down and we were well received by those already there. The mum was particularly happy as its been a while we saw last. We settled in my girlfriend's room and the whole family had a great dinner together. I was able to bond well with the family as we shared our experiences with anxiety and depression. My girlfriend felt I talked too much but I made her understand it was because I felt at home. We argued before going to bed and when we woke on the next day. I was furious as it was her mum's day and I dont like the fact that she is ruining it already. She later calmed down and apologized. I let go and she fell asleep in my arms..i also had a small nap too."

My girlfriend's mum was very happy with the gift. She also appreciated my efforts in making her daughter happy. I felt happy that I made a difference. The party lasted for 4 hours and we had to leave for the airport. We had a smooth flight back and we arrived home late in the night.
