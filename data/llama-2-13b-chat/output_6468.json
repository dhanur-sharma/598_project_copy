        "Summarize the following story in first person: I live in Dayton Ohio, and we recently had a mass shooting. It occurred in an area that I frequent, I was there the night before and I had plans to be there that night, but I had been out too late the night before and was hungover and tired. People I know and am very close live and work there, so it was stressful to say the least. Spending that night reaching out to people that I knew down there, and getting phone calls from people I knew around the country reaching out to make sure I was OK was emotional in both a negative and a positive way. Worrying about people and knowing there are people all over the country caring about you was an unique experience. It was a night without much sleep. Afterwards my city came together in an amazing way. Everyone was out supporting local businesses much more than they usually do. The restaurants and bars were busy beyond their normal capacity. People were hugging on the streets. Everyone was wearing shirts to support the city. Celebrities from all over the country were showing support. Everywhere I went people were kinder than normal. Even random people on the street were more affectionate and caring. It was truly an unique experience."
