        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last week was a whirlwind. As soon as I closed the Jonestown deal, my boss paired me up with Frank Dingle to hammer out a new  corporate initiative addressing The Defamation of Hirsute and Burly Longshoremen. If there is one silver lining, it's that I get to work with the dreamiest, steamiest, CREAMIEST hunk in the office, Frank Dingle. I first became aware of Frank last February when he applied for a job as Junior Director of Roast Beef Juice Operations. He didn't get the job, but he got me all hot and bothered when he strutted through the office in a bedazzled business suit and golden wingtips. He was later called back to interview for a staff accountant position. Since that's my department, I was asked to sit in on the interview. (Just between me and you, diary? I wish they had asked me to sit on Frank's lap!) I recommended him for the position and he was hired. Frank and I will be working together until this new job is ready to submit. So it's exciting, but I dunno. Ever since my divorce, I've felt like a part of my is missing. Sometimes Frank says things that remind me of my ex. I can't tell if I'm being paranoid, or if I should regard them as warning signs, but he's such a stud-muffin I can barely contain it! I keep trying to make eyes at him. I can't tell if he's ignoring my signals or if he's just very dumb. Yesterday I saw him eat an entire tube of Crest toothpaste. Like, as a snack. Nevertheless, I hope to God he asks me out. I could really use a stiff drink and a hard... well... anyway. Talk to you later, diary! XOXOXO"
