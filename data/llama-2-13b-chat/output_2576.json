        "Summarize the following story in first person: What a day that I will never forget. Brian had been doing so well, and we were all so proud. so many of us around him had our own demons and addictions. We all knew how hard it was for him, but we tried supporting him the best we could. He had been in and out of rehab, and in some minor trouble legally. His family had begun to not trust him anymore. They never left him, but by the end it was his friends that had to help and support him, because his family just couldn't take anymore. We had lent him money to pay off fines. we would drive him to NA meetings. I even helped him get a job at the printshop I work at. He was on top of it all. Then after all his legal bills started clearing up, and he had payed off debts his personal money started adding up. It only took a couple weeks of him getting some nice paychecks to spend how he pleased. One day he came in saying he was just so tired. I think we all knew he wasn't just tired, but he had been doing good, and so we got through the day and hoped that we could talk to him more the next day when he was more sobered up. We never did. He never made it back to work the next day. His aunt called us to say they had found him that morning, he didn't make it."
