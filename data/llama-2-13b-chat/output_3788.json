        "Summarize the following story in first person: The last month has been pretty wild, but I'm finally starting to settle in. Moving away from my hometown was a crazy change, and it's hard to believe I actually went through with it. Most people don't. Ultimately though I was just too bored in my hometown. Seeing the same friends at the same places while drinking and eating the same things just grows so tiresome. At least for me anyway. It was my snoozefest of a desk job that forced me to pack up and head across the country for a new life, but the dull familiarity of the area was a big reason too. I needed a change in the worst way. I probably should give myself more credit for actually pulling such a change off too. Even if that change means starting at the bottom at a new job and living in a tiny apartment. But it's new and it's fresh, and that's the significant part. I have a whole new area to explore here out west, and the weather here makes back home feel like Russia. I know some of my friends are already thinking about coming to visit for a weekend or so. In a way I don't want them out here, but I would certainly like to see them eventually. This new life has the potential to really let me grow in ways that I never could back home, so I'm just pumped about getting to blaze my own trail at this point in my life."
