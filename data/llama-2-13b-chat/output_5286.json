        "Summarize the following story in first person: Recently I participated in a surprise engagement for my high school best friend.  Her now fiance had planned out the event and asked a couple of her closest friends to be a part of it to help plan and to be there for the special event.  Seeing the joy in both of their faces was something I'll never forget.  It was great to be a part of something so special in their lives. A group of us all got together to spend a weekend together, the reason unknown to my friend of course.  We spent a few days together catching up and sharing laughs.  The night of the question, we all went to dinner and continued our \"vacation\" as normal.  We took a stroll of the city to enjoy the nightlife and scenery until we happened upon the location set up for the scene.  We all watched as he dropped to his knee and popped the question as their favorite song played softly in the background.  She said yes and we all cheered and congratulated the happy couple.  From there we continued to venture the city, this time in celebration.  It was definitely a night to remember.  Not only for the newly engaged couple, but for all of the rest of us to be able to partake in such an important event in their lives/relationship.  It was great to be able to witness the pure happiness in both of their faces and to be able to share that with them.  We all can only hope the wedding will be just as magical."
