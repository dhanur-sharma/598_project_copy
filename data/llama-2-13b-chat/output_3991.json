        "Summarize the following story in first person: I as feeling pretty down and depressed. My boyfriend decided to surprise me with a night out at the pub with friends. It was nice to get out and away from being down and it was a nice surprise. I felt loved and appreciated which was something I needed for that day. That happened about 3 weeks ago and I am feeling much better now that I was able to pull myself out of that \"down\" feeling. I love my boyfriend for being so loving and caring about me so much to pull together a surprise like that. Life has been rough for the last few months and I really feel much better now that I surrounded myself with friends. I usually write in this diary more depressing entries which seem to be my pattern. I feel much happier now ever since this surprise party and my depression is less and less each day. I am being to love myself again. I feeling like life is good. All because of my boyfriend and his love for me. I didnt think he loved me as much as he really does. This makes me happy. It takes away from my sadness. Depression and feeling down really can haunt someone like me. I am so grateful. I feel love now. My friends are awesome."
