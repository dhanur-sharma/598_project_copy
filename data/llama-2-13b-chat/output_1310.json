        "Summarize the following story in first person: I am in a bit of a reflective mood today. Not much has happened so I want to tell you  Mr Diary about my first relationship. Specifically the end of it. Puppy love is always so crazy isnt it? I thought he was the one! At fourteen! Now i can look back at it and laugh, but at the time I felt like my life was ENDING! Boys will be boys though, and there attention spans are not long. Nor is their maturity. ha! I walked into school, and held out my hand to him for him to hold. He pushed it away and called me a CHEATER! Diary, like i said I was SO in LOVE, there was no way I would have cheated. I don't know why he chose that as a reason to break up with me because it wasn't the truth. I was so confused because I didn't talk to other boys, and I sure didn't cheat.  He also called me a slut, and let me tell you, that kind of stuff runs through a middle-school quick! It really hurt my feelings.  My good friends stood by me, but people that didn't know me leered at me in the halls. I just rushed to my classes as quick as possible. I was embarrassed to go to school for two whole weeks.  Luckily Middleschool minds run short term, so it was al forgotten about within weeks. It was still one of the worst experiences I had at 14 though!"

I am so grateful for that experience, because it made me the person I am today.  I know that may sound strange, but it did. It taught me how to stand up for myself and how to not let other people's words get to me. I am so glad that I had that experience at such a young age. It has helped me so much in my life.  I will always look back on it and remember it. \n\n"
