        "Summarize the following story in first person: My grandfather grew up working on the family farm. My grandmother grew up in the city. My great grandmother was a stay at home mother while my great grandfather worked as an accountant. My grandmother was taking a walk through the city one day and accidentally bumped into my grandfather. They hit it off instantly. They decided to meet the following night at a small diner on the corner. While my grandmother was afraid to inform her father of this date she went ahead and told her parents. They wanted to meet the \"young fellow\" that was going to be taking their daughter out. My grandpa showed up at their doorstep with a bouquet of flowers. While they expected a young man who came from money they agreed to give my grandpa a chance. My grandpa took my grandmother out to a diner called the Milkshake Diner. My grandmother knew she was falling in love with my grandpa the moment they sat down. They decided to go dancing afterwards. My grandpa took my grandma home at 10:00 and walked her to the door. My grandmother sat down with her parents the following day and expressed how she felt. She wanted her parents and his parents to all go to church the following day. They met up at church and had lunch afterwards. My grandfather asked for my grandmother's hand in marriage. My grandfather and grandmother were married the following month. My grandmother knew my grandfather didn't come from much wealth so she didn't expect a ring. My grandfather surprised my grandmother with his mother's engagement ring. She was unbelievably touched and cried through the whole ceremony. They have now been married 50 years and couldn't love each other more.  I love being able to tell this story. I will forever cherish the ring she gave me."
