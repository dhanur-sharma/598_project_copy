        "Summarize the following story in first person: On Monday night , my Mother in law clogged the toilet and left. My husband puts some unclogger stuff in it and calls MIL  to tell her that he did. Well he showers and MIL gets back home. She pours Drano on top of the other chemical already in the toilet;  causes toxic gas and fills the house up with  fumes. MIL decided to go smoke a cigarette and \"take care of it later\" . which by now the fumes are overwhelming. My husband walks back downstairs from showering is is overpowered by the  smell.  He yells for her to come help him. She has her and my husband scoop the toilet water out into the bathtub to get rid of it.  Scooping it out was the only way to get rid of the chemical. Now we need to have our septic system sucked out. I opened ever single door and put fans blowing the air outside. Needless to say they both ended up in the ER last night and MIL had to stay for observation, as she has COPD. MIL is also in the begging stages of Alzheimer's disease and this is not the first time she has done something dangerous by mistake. It makes me scared to thing of what she is going to do now that she is starting to lose her mind literally.  She has been losing her memory for a while and doesn't remember simple conversations sometimes and it makes me really sad. But the over all is she is sometimes dangerous because of her memory loss."
