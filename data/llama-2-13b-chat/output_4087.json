        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last month we gave birth to our first child.  After 48 hours in the hospital we our little girl made her first appearance.  We had waited four years for the moment and we're so excited for it.  The doctor held her up and announced that we had had a healthy baby girl.  We did not know the gender of our baby so this was a very big moment for us.  I then got to hold my daughter for the first time.  I held her for almost hour.  During this time I talked to her about many different things.  I was over the moon.  As we moved to the maternity floor, my parents came in to meet her.  They cried and took many pictures of her.  We stayed in the hospital for another two nights.  During that time, they ran several texts on my wife and daughter to ensure that both were healthy.  Thankfully, everyone got a clean bill of health.  We were then allowed to go home."
