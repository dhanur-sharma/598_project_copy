        "Summarize the following story in first person: Around two months ago me and my girlfriend decided we would move in together. I was a little worried how things were going to go because we hadn't been dating very long at the time and didn't know how we would get a long when we were in each other space all the time. We were excited to see how all this would go but first we had to get through the move. I lucky have access to a truck so we didn't  need to rent anything. My girlfriend had to work that day so i started the move solo. It wasn't to bad at first since i just did the boxes but that went by fast. Next I started with the heavier stuff with a dolly like the washer and dryer. Next was the chairs and desk but i was starting to run out of the stuff that i could move by myself. I picked my girlfriend up from work and we got a quick snack before we got back to our new place with a great view of Maine. We then started the move with the couch its not very heavy well at least for me but we had to lift it to angle it through the door. That part was very frustrating but we got through it. Next was the mattress. It was much lighter than then sofa but to angle through the halls was a mess and we started to snap at each other. I think we were both getting tired and started to take it out on one another. After we got the mattresses in though that was it and we both calmed down and turned from grumpy to relieved. Now that the move is over we have nothing but good times these last two months and i know we made the right choice to live together."
