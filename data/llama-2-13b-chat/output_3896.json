        "Summarize the following story in first person: Seven weeks ago, I was experiencing a manic episode and I made some risky decisions. I met with a stranger at a bar. I didn't know him at all but I still was willing to leave the bar with him. I knew it was risky, but I didn't care in the moment. He wasn't a man I would usually go home with either. He looked mean and rough and he wasn't very kind to me really but I still followed him when he asked me to leave the bar. When we got outside, he led me into the alley by the bar. There was an overflowing dumpster and a bad smell but I still let him push me against the wall and kiss me. I knew I shouldn't be doing this; I knew that this was a bad decision and frankly, I was scared. I pushed him off me as hard as I could and even that barely worked. Once he got off me, he was very angry. \"What's the problem?\" he asked. I slipped out of his grasp and started to retreat.\"I don't want this. I'm going back to the bar. I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.\" I tried to remain calm. He starts to follow me out of the alley and I break into a run. I get in before he gets to me. Once I'm inside, I tried to get to the bar and to the safety of the bar keep. The man from the alley entered the room, looked at me next to the bar, and walked out. He could still be outside and I'm fearful that he wants revenge."
