        "Summarize the following story in first person: Ever since my husband and I got married we have been living paycheck to paycheck. We can' t seem to find a way to get out this cycle. To our surprise, we learned 7 months after our wedding we were expecting. When she came in July I had to leave my job, because childcare was too expensive. Two years later we are still in the same financial situation. In the beginning of July I decided that I wanted to do something fun for my daughter's birthday. So, I began using MTurk to make a little extra money. I began working harder everyday to make the money to take my family to the Zoo. After I saved a little of the money I began making plans. Telling my husband and his family of what I wanted to do. Unfortunately my husband had to work on her birthday and the next week, so we pushed the date to the first Saturday in August. Over the next month I was determined to do this for my family. Four days before my planned event, my husband and I began to looked at our finances. We realized that July had been a hard month financially for us. We did not have enough to pay rent for our one bedroom apartment. With much disappointment I decided to cancel the Zoo trip and used the money I saved for rent. And through ever financial means we had, we made enough money to pay our rent. That Saturday I sat at home, enjoying the day with my family. To my surprise I got a call from my Mother-In-law. She told me to come to her house with our daughter and we were going to the zoo. I was both surprised and very touched by their kindness. I hadn't had someone show such kindness in a long time. It was a joy to my daughter enjoy the zoo for the first time."
