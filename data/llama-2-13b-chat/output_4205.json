        "Summarize the following story in first person: Isn't it strange how the smallest little thing can change our lives? I had regarded Phillipa with long-distance loathing since she had pulled off my bathing trunks as a joke 10 years ago. We had been joking about sex, and the sizes of certain people's equipment, and to prove a long-forgotten point her hand yanked down my trunks, and our friends had a hearty laugh at my expense.  I had not seen her since that day. I heard she had spent some time in Australia, working on a research vessel. About 4 months ago some ocean engineering student I know had built an Island in the middle of a lake they had created for a project. to inaugurate the island they were going to throw a party one afternoon. I was invited and I arrived at about 1 PM. the only way to get to that island was on a raft pulled along by a string above. while I was standing around nursing my beer, a darkly tanned blonde woman came up to me and asked me if I remembered her. I looked at her blankly for a moment.\"Ph-ph-Phillipa?,\" I stammered. To make a long story short it was. But this was not the Phillipa that I remembered. The Phillipa that I remembered was pudgy, whiny, fat-armed, stoop-shouldered and forgettable. This tall woman was commanding, lanky, graceful, gorgeous and apprised me confidently with the bluest eyes I think I had ever seen. One thing lead to another and we went for a walk along the ocean. The night ended long before the walk did."

She had been all over the globe. She had been in Antarctica, the arctic circle, the south China sea, the Indian ocean, the Mediterranean, the Red sea, the Atlantic and the Pacific. She had seen more of the world than most people would see in 5 lifetimes. We talked until the sun went down and we had to go back to the party. After that we went out on a few more dates. We talked about everything. She was smart, funny, sexy, beautiful and kind. I fell in love with her. She was the first woman that I had ever met that I felt that I could spend the rest of my life with. The smallest little thing, a chance encounter at a party, had changed my life forever.\"\n\n"
