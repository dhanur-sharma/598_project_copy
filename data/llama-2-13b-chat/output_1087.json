        "Summarize the following story in first person: On the 6th of June 2019, my elder sister and I had a fight. I had to leave the house early in the morning and at the time I left, she was not awake. Usually when I'm leaving the house the house, I tell her, since she needs the key to get into the main house. My sister lives in our outhouse, and she usually comes to the main house to do some things. I think, since I'm not certain, that was the first reason that annoyed her, which ultimately led to the fight. Another thing was that as I was leaving the house, I ate a bit of her food before I left, since I knew I had a long day ahead of me. When I got to work, my sister called me, but I didn't pick the call. Thus, this all accumulated to make my sister  angry. As I was coming home from work that day, I was also a bit agitated because I was not able to get home early due to traffic, but my sister did not go to work. When I came home she asked me a question about both the food and not telling her when I left the house  which I answered in a snobbish manner. She then asked another question which I didn't respond to this time. After that, she then took offence and started to get angry, but as I was also angry things escalated quickly. Careless words were said by both parties and it nearly turned into a dire situation . Thankfully the intervention of my other elder sister stopped things. I must say things were sour between the two of us for about 2 weeks due to the fight. All is well between us now though."
