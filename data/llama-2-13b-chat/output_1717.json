        "Summarize the following story in first person: 2 months ago my best friend Nina got married on a beach in Costa Rica. I was so happy for her but my memories of her wedding have been completely ruined. During her wedding reception my boyfriend Dave told me that we had to leave early because he had to tell me something. I was so nervous the entire car ride home because he looked really cold and serious. After we got back home and went into my apartment he told me to sit down. He then proceeded to tell me that he had gotten another girl pregnant. I could not believe my ears and I sat there in pure shock, I couldn't cry even if I wanted to. He continued to speak and he told me that he had attended the bachelor party for my best friends husband. There he had met a stripper and he ended up sleeping with her. She had then notified him about her pregnancy the morning of my best friends wedding. I noticed that he looked upset the entire wedding but I never thought it would be this serious. I yelled at him and I quickly kicked him out of my apartment. This was not something I could forgive. This all happened 2 months ago but I still see him around town. He is now dating that stripper and it seems like they will raise the baby together. I am now working on moving on with my life as happily as I possibly can."
