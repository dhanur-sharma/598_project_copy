        "Summarize the following story in first person: I had never been to Delhi before. I was warned by other travelers that it was the part of India and to be extra vigilant when traavelling the state. Being a carefree traveller, I did not heed the advice of my fellow travellers. I fell asleep on the train ride and at the station. I was very tired. Train rides in India are very slow and time consuming. When I woke up, I noticed my laptop was missing. It had been stolen. I started to panic. I needed it for work. Luckily, a stranger noticed my state of worry and asked me if I needed help. I explained the situation. He offered to help me and in hindsight it was a bad idea to trust a stranger in India, Luckily, he turned out to be a good person. He took me to the largest IT center in India and we looked at different laptop models. They were a bit pricey, but I had to have one for work. I ended up finding one in my price range and was able to buy a good brand for cheap. I was very lucky that day."
