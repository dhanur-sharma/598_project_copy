        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was during the first weekend of July when I was finally able to do something that I hadn't been able to do in over 25 years. I was able to drag race for the first time since I was in my lower 20's.  While that was a big deal, the fact that I was able to race in a national event was huge. It had always been a lifelong dream for it to happen as I never figure that I would be able to buy a race car so I never thought that it was a possibility. But about two weeks before the race was going to take place, a really good friend surprised me and told be that he had always known that I wanted to race and that he wanted to make it happen. He had ran in several national events and I had been able to watch him do it on a couple of those occasions While he had never made it past the 2nd round in any of his attempts, he knew that I would love to give it a shot. My birthday was coming up and he said \"that it was time for me to get my chance.\" At first, I thought that he was kidding but he was being honest. He told me that he had been working on the race car and that it was ready for me to run it. The weekend of the races, we headed to the track and did some qualifying passes. The car ran great although it took me a few runs to get used to the shift set-up that he had on the car. My reaction times were decent but they definitely weren't where I needed them to be for race day. We had a small engine issue pop up but nothing major and it was fixed in a short amount of time. My family enjoyed being able to see some of the racing greats that were there and my kid's really like getting autographs from them and getting to take pictures with them. It was expensive to do anything there but it was all about the memories that weekend. I wound up losing in the 1st round due to my poor reaction time. But either way, I was an experience that I will never forget."
