I knew it would be hard.  I decided to be studious.  I studied everyday.  I didn't watch tv at all.  I didn't hang out with friends.  I grabbed my text book and studied for 4 hours a day.  It was very intense.  On the day of the exam, I was prepared.  I answered every question as best as I could.  I ended up passing with flying colors.   I actually got a perfect score. I was the only person to ever do that.  This was the highest achievement of my life thus far.  I was proud of myself."
