        "Summarize the following story in first person: About a month ago I had my first child. I was absolutely terrified but I was also shocked at how easy it was. I had a C section and the surgery went on without a hitch. When the doctor told me I was going to need a C section, I cried. The thought of getting cut open was so scary for me. I had never had any kind of surgery in my life. I thought about my baby and what if they cut him. They assured me everything would be fine. They drugged me up and they performed the surgery. I couldn't even feel anything. Afterwards, my baby was totally fine and completely healthy. I have a lot of trust in our doctor's and our medical system now. Without them, I would have lost my greatest treasure in life. My baby is laying down safe and sound right now and it's all because of them. I really can't believe how easy it all was."
