        "Summarize the following story in first person: We continued to surf for the next hour.  The waves were perfect.  Small 1-2 foot waves with a nice offshore wind.  The conditions were perfect for the kids.  The kids were having so much fun!  After our surf session, we took a break for lunch.  We had a nice small cook out at the park by the Atlantic Ocean.  We cooked burgers and hot dogs.  It was very refreshing to come in from a very fun activity and eat.  We were so hungry , no one said a word as kids and wife were eating.  We had our burgers and hot dogs with the usual condiments , chips, fruits, water, and soda.  We simply relaxed and enjoyed the ocean breeze come through the gazebo.  It was a nice Florida summer day.  No work, no school, no worries.  Afterwards , we road our bike in the park.  We biked along the dirt roads that led inland to another part of the park,  In one of the ponds, we spotted turtles and alligators basking in the sun,  When we got back, we took a little nap under the gazebo before heading home for the afternoon.  Another typical endless summer day spend with the people I love."
