        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was diagnosed this spring with thyroid cancer. This was a blow to me since I had already gone through breast cancer six years ago. I am turned 50 this year, so being diagnosed with two kinds of cancer in six years was very emotional for me. I did not expect to have thyroid cancer as well. I imagined that the breast cancer was a fluke and that I would never get diagnosed with cancer again. I was a healthy person, this is what everyone told me. I went to the endocrinologist to follow up on some thyroid nodes and he saw something that looked \"weird\".  After he took the biopsy and they got the results, I was told I had to have a thyroidectomy. I had already had a mastectomy, a hysterectomy and now a thyroidectomy.. I was losing body parts quickly. In addition to this, on the morning of the surgery, I was walking to the car with my boyfriend and I tripped on the sidewalk outside of my home and fell and broke my wrist! I had to arrive at the hospital in horrible pain. It was not a very good experience. I was more worried about my arm than my thyroid surgery. I had the surgery and they ended up doing an x-ray in the recovery room as I was coming out of anesthesia! I was in pain the entire time I was in the hospital and I had to wait all day the next day for a doctor to tell me what to do about my wrist. After watching Jaws and Jaws II in my hospital bed, an orthopedic surgeon ran in and gave me my diagnosis. I finally got to go home, however, I now had another complication. I had a huge seroma on my neck from my surgery. It looked and felt terrible. It was a very large accumulation of fluid that would not go away for weeks. I felt like an injured bird. I was just so tired of medical testing and being cut up and stuck with needles. I was exhausted from being in so much pain. It was one memorable experience that I want to forget. I just want to be and stay healthy, and that is all I want from now on."
