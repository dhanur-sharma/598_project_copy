        "Summarize the following story in first person: So I went to Ghana in April with my two brothers. We both went on a separate date. We all wanted to meet there this year to have a celebration for my mom's birthday. My father and mother are no longer together but my father happens to be in Ghana also. We had a party for my mother and it was a successful event. After the event I went out with my two brothers to enjoy the rest of the evening. While we were out there having fun I saw this beautiful young lady. I really liked her so I try to talk to her but she wouldn't pay me no mind. I kept trying but she wouldn't give me her attention. I think it was because she was with her mother. Soon her mom left her alone to get something, so I tried again and I was able to get her number. I called her and we went out to get to know each other. In my culture marriage is not something that takes a long time to get into. I told my father about the girl and he wanted to speak to her. I brought the girl to my father and he asked her a few questions about her family. In my culture it is easy to marry a woman if both of our cultural are the same. So my father agreed with me getting to know her and possible marrying her. We arrange an event for her parent to come meet with my parent for us to discuss if I can marry her. We had the meeting and everything went well and now I am preparing to marry her in 2021. For now we are taking it slowly. The only problem is it's a long distant relationship but I think we can make it work. she lives in Ghana and I live in the U.S. We talk to each other every day. It is not easy waking up and not having her next to me. I plan to visit her soon again this year."
