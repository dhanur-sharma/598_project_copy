        "Summarize the following story in first person: About three months ago I had the opportunity to visit an animal shelter to look at some dogs. I had been really bummed since my dog of 15 years past away due to old age. I had been very depressed about my dog's passing and I thought it may be a good idea to adopt a new puppy. My family, especially my youngest son has been wanting another dog. Although it would be tough for me to take on the \"emotional\" responsibility of  having another pet, I feel that my son deserves to have a loyal pet, the same chance I had. Plus having a new puppy around is always super interesting, challenging, and FUN. This will allow me the chance to delegate and teach responsibility to my son. He is 11 now and I feel its time for him to take up some chores. This will also allow him to grow closer to the dog.. as I did with my previous pet. Seeing the new puppy brought joy to my family and my son was ecstatic. Truth be told I really got a little sad and I thought about Nova, my previous dog. Nova was great dog and we were really close. The new Puppy will soon take over as the family pet, but I will never forget Nova. She definitely made my life more interesting and enjoyable. I am very much looking forward to this new challenge and I believe that the spirit of my old friend will be part of this new dog."
