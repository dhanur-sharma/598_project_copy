Then, he gave me the news that I had developed type 2 diabetes! I was really shocked. I felt so sad and ashamed. I am really afraid. I'll have to change so much in my life now. I don't know what types of pains I will suffer in the future because of this. I am especially terrified and heartbroken because of what happened with my sister. She passed away a few years ago. I never expected to be diagnosed with the same disease she died from. I guess it would be something that runs in my family. I am so upset and afraid. I  need to talk to my mom. I hope it all works out okay."
