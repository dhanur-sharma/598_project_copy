        "Summarize the following story in first person: There is this girl I fell in love with when we both were kids. She was my first real love. I hadn't been in love before I met her but we instantly connected. She was very sweet, generous, compassionate and always helpful. I remember back when we met, she would bring me sweets from her house and we would share chocolate and ice cream. I fell in love with her since I was 7 years old and although we were kids and didn't understand much about love, there was this feeling that we belonged together. When we were applying for high school, we chose the same schools and we got accepted at the same high school. We started officially dating during our second year of high school. We had clearly been in love ever since we met but didn't know what love means until then. Our dating life was very gratifying. We were best friends and always inseparable. We kept each other's secret and always had each other's back. Unfortunately, when we left for college, we couldn't continue our relationship long distance and ended up breaking up. She married someone else after college and I married another woman as well. Four months, I got informed that she had been diagnosed with cancer and a few weeks after i learned that, I received the worst news I have ever received that she had passed away. I still haven't gotten used to this world not having her in it. She was the most beautiful soul and I haven't experienced any happiness since her passing."
