We fought for hours I feel like because II\u2019m more emotionally unstable then a lot of people realize. I hide it well, I try not to let what has happen to me take over my life. But there are days it gets to much for me to take on, and I feel over taken by the story no one knows. He have let be feeling like I am not worth anyones times. We have been together more then I have been with anyone, and this is how you treat out love? Or was there any love at all. Now I question everything and everyone around me. I would have give up so much to give you everything, and it seems you were willing to throw away everything we built for a time or lust and lies. I sit alone with my thoughts so many nights. In the still quietness of the reality that consumes my present, and all but assured future, I fall in the pit of its emptiness. The nothingness takes over far more often then I\u2019d like to admit.  YOu have caused me to question myself. This I will stay with me for a long time and I will find it hard to get past for a better future. I thought we were meant to send out life together. Not I know you were a block in my growth and will be hold be back. I dont want to see you every again. I wish I never met you."
