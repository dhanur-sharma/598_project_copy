        "Summarize the following story in first person: My children were up early on the first day of school.  My son jumped out of bed as soon as the alarm on Alexa rang out and immediately started to get dressed.  My daughter was excited but it takes a lot more than excitement to make her jump out of sleep.  Her brother turned on her light causing her to stir a little.  SHe usually waits for me to come and pull the covers off.  She begrudgingly got up and got dressed and followed her brother and I down the stairs.  Daddy was in the kitchen making breakfast--my son's favorite--egg in a hole.  They both mowed down the food.  My son and daughter walked outside for the obligatory picture that I needed to take and then we waited for the first time the kids would not be on the same bus.  It was bittersweet seeing son refuse me walking him to the bus stop because gosh mom you are my mom.  We had another 25 minutes before my daughters bus was expected so we sat and watched cartoons together.  I kept looking at her brushing her hair realizing these times are fleeting.  As the bus approached our driveway, she gave me a huge hug and a kiss.  She ran to the end of the driveway and turned around and blew me a kiss and hugged herself like she was hugging me.  Even though she was a bit afraid, she was excited to start the new year, alone.  At least my daughter still clings to me as we say goodbye."
