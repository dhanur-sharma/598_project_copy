        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was putting up string lights at my place. I went to borrow a ladder. I had bought the tools needed in advance. I had these coaxial clips that allowed me to easily hang the light string. I also had a extension cable to bring power to the string light. When I finally started to hang the string lights, I realized that the ladder was not tall enough. I had to make up a tool to increase my reach when putting up the coaxial clip so that it would reach the ceiling. It was also scary because I was reaching while on the ladder. But I was able to finally finish putting it up after a long time. I dropped a lot of the clips while attempting to put up the string lights. I was also sweating a lot. I made sure to put on goggles before doing this work so I can protect my eyes in case something fell on my face. I also put on shoes while using the ladder. I wished the hammer was a bit longer as well. Overall, it was a lot of work but it was worth it. The string lights are beautiful."
