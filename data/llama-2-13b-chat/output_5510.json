        "Summarize the following story in first person: Just recently, I had to clean up some major water spills in my house, due to the window air conditioning units leaking water.  It began with just one unit, which was the downstairs unit, then the bedroom unit began to leak a few days later, which made the most damage of the leaks.  Initially, I thought it was just filters that were giving the units trouble, as previously I had decided to clean the filter in my bedroom unit.  I felt the unit was not blowing the air consistently as before, so I decided to clean it and then it began to blow like normal.  The water leaking, however was not going to be an easy fix. I didn't want to buy new units or pay for service. I just assumed the leaking was from overrunning, heat moisture, etc and allowed it for about a week.  Almost two weeks and a half had went by and I came home one day and the unit in my bedroom had been leaking water all over the room.  I have a suitcase and some important boxes next to the unit that were damaged but certainly able to be replaced. When the cleaning of the filters didn't work, I had to think of another plan. I researched some common causes for the leaking, as many of those who had experienced the same trials, all mentioned that the units have to be cleaned at intervals.  The units began to hold alot of matter that clogs the drain up, that don't allow for adequate flow of any moisture that forms.  Believing I researched enough, I decided to break the units down and clean them myself, as well as the filters.  The units have been working properly the last few days and no more leaking. With both now leaking, the units had been leaking for a couple of weeks and of course over time, it began to damage items in the house."
