        "Summarize the following story in first person: I took my 14 year old son on a 5 day vacation to New York City. It was our first trip together, just the two of us.  Coming from our small town in Idaho it was an amazing experience for him. Spending time one on one with him was an amazing experience for me. We started our trip with a 4 hour flight into JFK Airport. We experienced our first subway ride together (and didn't even get lost!) on the way to the airport. Over the next few days, we spent our time waking up late and staying out late, experiencing everything New York City has to offer. We went to the Statue of Liberty, the 9/11 Memorial, Top of the Rock, Chelsea Markets, China Town, Little Italy and so many more it's hard to list them all.  My son was amazed at all of it.  He told me that it was exactly like it is shown on television, from all the people and the buildings, to the steam coming from the sewer grates at night. We went on a top of the bus tour into Brooklyn, saw Tom Hiddelston on Broadway, and spent the day in Central Park. I think you could live in New York City for years and still not see all of it.  My son says every moment of it was his favorite part.   My favorite part was when my son said, \"Mom, I really had fun. We should have more trips like this, just me and you.\"  I can't wait to go on another adventure with him!"
