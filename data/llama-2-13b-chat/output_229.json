One day I was out in the yard watching her play. She was jumping rope and having a good time. She didn't have a care in the world. It was just a normal day. The next thing I knew I heard a loud bang down the street. A little girl had just been hit by a vehicle. I was terrified. I ran down the street as fast as I could. I ran over to her to check on her. She was bleeding. I called emergency services on my phone. I told them what was happening and they needed to hurry about as fast as they could. They got their and took the girl off to the hospital."
