        "Summarize the following story in first person: I spent the day visiting with my nieces. Watching them with my sister it really hit home. My dream of having my own family will never come true. That day I promised myself that I would do everything I could to be a great uncle to them.  Since I will never be a father. I also came to the realization that I can no longer keep up with my nieces. My health no longer being what it was. When I was younger I was an active person able to do so much. Now I am trying to come to terms with not being able to do the things that I used to. When I realized how much I have physically lost. I came very close to ending my life. Today I am finding new purpose in life. But I am also searching for a new dream to keep me going during the long nights. On a final note while I did contemplate ending my life. My family has helped me to move on and search for meaning in life."
