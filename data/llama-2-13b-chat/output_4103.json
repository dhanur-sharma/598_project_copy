        "Summarize the following story in first person: Dear Diary,It's been a while since I've written in here but I guess it's time to start again. The craziest thing that happened recently was about a month ago. I went to visit my sister and her husband in at their house and help them watch their kids for the day. My sister was 7 months pregnant, not time to have her baby yet so we didn't think anything of it. We were playing some video games on their old school NES system when my sister thought she had to use the bathroom. When she came out of the bathroom she said there was a little blood. She didn't need to poop - she was in labor!! We timed her contractions and within an hour it was time to go to the hospital. It was really scary and fast. Both of her previous pregnancies were induced so we were shocked. I downloaded an app on my phone and it told me when to go to the hospital. Since my car was blocking my brother in law's we hopped in my jeep and I drove everyone to the hospital. We went to the labor and delivery area where she was immediately checked in and admitted. I got to be in the room when the baby was delivered. It was an amazing experience. I had never seen a baby being born before and the fact that I got to see my niece be born made me so happy and emotional. It's an experience I will never ever forget. The baby ended up staying in the NICU for a while since she was technically a preemie, but she's doing fine and is perfectly healthy."
