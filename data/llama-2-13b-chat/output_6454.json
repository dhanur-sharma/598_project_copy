        "Summarize the following story in first person: My wife and I went to a wedding a few months ago. It was for a few friends and my wife was in the wedding. I wasn\u2019t in the wedding, but I might as well have been. I basically made sure that everything went smoothly. First, I made sure that the groom made it to the ceremony. He had some alcohol beforehand and started to get emotional. I made sure that he stayed under control. Then, after the ceremony, I made sure to get everyone drinks and snacks while they got their pictures taken. The bridal dance was a mess initially because nobody knew what they were doing. I made sure that it went well and that everyone kept dancing. At the end of the night, I helped load the cars. Basically, I made sure that the wedding went off without a hitch. These originally were my wife\u2019s friends so she was very appreciative. As a result, she definitely was looking to reward me. So, we ended up having some amazing sex at the end of the night. It definitely was an experience to remember."
