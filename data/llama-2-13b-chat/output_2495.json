        "Summarize the following story in first person: I've been sort of a recluse the last several years. Not much in the way of close relationships and not a whole lot of random acts of kindness have come my way.  That's whatever.  It doesn't bother me and I don't expect stuff like that to happen so I typically don't feel the lack.  About six months ago I started a friendship with someone in an internet forum where groups on people that primarily work online sort of gather to discuss things during the day.  We've talked frequently and even though we don't work together so to speak it has many of the qualities of a work friendship.  Anyone that knows me knows how I feel about my dog.  I'm quick with the pictures and he get's a fair amount of mentions in my day to day conversation.  My boy is terribly allergic to fleas and they've been very bad this year.  I've been fighting to get them under control and for the most part it hasn't gone well so my dog has been miserable. It bothers me. A lot.  Point being that I've discussed the flea problem and solicited possible solutions that I may not have tried yet within this group of people.  I haven't gotten much in the way of feedback because I've tried everything there is to try.  You're probably wondering where I'm going with this and I'm getting to it I promise.  A few Saturdays ago I took the dog for a nice long walk around the neighborhood relatively early in the day. It was gorgeous out. Bright and sunny.  That was nice but it really highlighted how bad off my poor pup was doing and I was feeling pretty crappy about the whole thing when we came back around to our street and headed down the driveway.  When I got to the door to go into the house I saw an Amazon box sitting in front of the door.  It had my name on it so I brought it inside and opened it.  Inside was one Xtra Large Seresto Flea Control Collar and 1 container of freeze dried liver treats.  She took it upon herself to order a flea control solution and a container of treats so my boy would feel better.  It was the nicest thing anyone had done for me in quite some time. I was touched."
