        "Summarize the following story in first person: I am optimistic by nature but here lately I have been so grateful that our founding fathers fought for our freedoms. I was watching the news and something about Syria came up. I was shocked that we live in the 21st century and people are still living in fear everyday because of war. We are a very lucky nation because other people are still living in severe poverty. I turned off the television and drove to work. During the drive I was listening to the news and I just can't believe that people still live in some places without necessities. Sometimes, I will get in a bad mood and start feeling sorry for myself. I try to snap out of it because I have such a good life compared to some others. We have a government who cares more than most but they don't even have governments. They are just worried about living and surviving. I will never know the fear these people face everyday. I am just so thankful for the life I have been given because it could have been a lot worse. I need to look into ways I can volunteer and try to help these folks. I can surely do something of value even if it's not monetary. Time to get on the computer and do some research."
