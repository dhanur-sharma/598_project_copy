        "Summarize the following story in first person: My Cousin's WeddingWe went to my cousin\u2019s wedding. It was a lovely wedding\u2013 very unlike any wedding I\u2019ve yet been to, but a lot like the weddings in the movies (you know, like The Wedding Crashers\u2026 never understood why someone would *want* to go to a wedding they weren\u2019t invited to).  The ceremony was short and simple, though there were a lot of attendants, complete with flower girl and ring-bearer.  The bride had both her father and step-father give her away, one on each arm.  The Lutheran minister was kind of a jolly middle-aged woman.  The gentlemen were almost all in army dress uniforms.  From my cousin\u2019s face, you could not tell he was hit by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan just a few months ago.  He\u2019s still not walking correctly and never may, but the damage seems to mainly be concentrated in one leg. The wedding was in a part of the country where folks are not as stiff as Midwesterners or as unstructured as Northern Californians.  I\u2019ve been to Midwestern wedding receptions that tried to be like this reception, but the soul wasn\u2019t there so they always ended up being kind of lame with folks congregated in the parking lot to talk away from the DJ.  People at this wedding line-danced (and not just to country music) and they enjoyed it.  My usually introverted uncle is apparently a dancing fiend and led the bride in some traditional dances.  This essay is plagiarized.  The food was great and full of local specialties (including something we heard about on the Splendid table from their road trip foodies).  And, important in my book for any wedding, they served appetizers between the wedding and reception. You may recall that the groom\u2019s parents had said they refused to attend because he was not getting married by a priest.  Not only did they not show up, despite his being hit by a roadside bomb in service to our country, they did not allow any siblings to come.  The daughter whose college my parents and aunts are paying was threatened with being disowned when her mother found out she was planning to attend.  So she didn\u2019t go.  Guests kept asking if I was a sister.  No, not a sister."

I was a bit surprised that there were not more veterans in attendance.  I\u2019m not sure if the groom\u2019s family is very anti-military or if they just did not want to make a big deal about his injury.  They are very private people, so maybe they just did not want to make a big deal about anything.  The reception was held in a large barn that had been converted into a party space.  It was very rustic and charming, with hay bales for seating and potted plants on the tables.  There was a photo booth set up with props and a large, flat-screen TV for slideshows.  The cake was a three-tiered masterpiece with intricate details and delicious-looking frosting.  The bride and groom did a traditional first dance, followed by a few other couples.  Then, the dance floor was opened up to everyone and the party really got started.  It was a night to remember, full of joy, love, and celebration"
