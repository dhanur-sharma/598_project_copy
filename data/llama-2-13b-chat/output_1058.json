        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was out taking a jog one day and I came across a scary situation. I saw a very small dog being chased by a larger dog. The larger dog was really fast and off leash so by the time the owner of the large dog realized what was happening, it was too late. The small dog was also off leash as well and I think it might have been a run away. I don't think the small dog realized what was happening and that it was in danger. I was very close to the small dog when I was watching this situation unfold. I was a little afraid that if I intervene that, I might get bit by the large dog. I chose to take the chance of getting bitten by the large dog to help save the smaller dog. I turned my back to the large dog to kind of create a blockade between it and the small dog. I scooped up the small dog and held it close to me. By this time, the large dog had reached me and it's owner was right behind it. The large dog barked loudly at the smaller dog in my arms. The owner of the large dog finally grabbed him and pulled him away from me and the small dog. I was pretty angry at the owner of the large dog for being careless. I raised my voice slightly as I told the owner of the large dog that his dog could have killed the small dog in one bite. The owner apologized profusely and finally snapped a leash onto the large dog's collar. After a few minutes, the large dog and it's owner were gone and I was left holding the small dog not knowing what to do with it. It had no tags on it and there was no one in site that it could possibly belong to. I took the little dog to a place where they checked for microchips, and I got lucky. Much to my happiness, the small dog had a microchip and I was able to reunite it with it's owner."
