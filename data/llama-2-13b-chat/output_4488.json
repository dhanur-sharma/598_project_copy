        "Summarize the following story in first person: A little over a month ago, my father experienced a medical emergency and had to be admitted to the emergency room. I was contacted and told by my mother when I was in the middle of work. The family had known about his situation for the past decade, or even longer. My father had been diagnosed with Hepatitis B and he had carried the condition since childhood. It apparently reared its head when he reached his sixties, and it took a heavy toll on his liver. He developed cirrhosis, and as a result, he went on disability and was forced to give up his job as an automotive mechanic. The years that followed, his condition seemed to stabilize, and having time off and not having to undergo strenuous activity while taking medication meant that we didn't have to worry about him 24/7. Unfortunately, his body seemed to get worse in the past two years, and it all came to a head the past year. He has since undergone multiple procedures to remove malignant growths on his liver, and the family was told that it's unlikely he'll live past the age of 75 without a liver transplant. In any case, the past month, his condition just seemed to become more aggressive. He had issues with his bowels, he had difficulty keeping down food, and he was lethargic. I'm not entirely sure what happened to him at the hospital, but his stay there was approximately two weeks. For those two weeks, my life was in disarray since I had to ferry my mother back and forth between the hospital and home at odd hours of the day, in addition to dealing with my work responsibilities. I also had to held my mother with tasks around the house since my father was not there to help her. We had to discuss how his life would be moving forward, especially since it's clear that he cannot handle his usual responsibilities. My siblings have been as supportive as possible, but they have families of their own. Being the only one without a family of my own, the responsibility of taking care of my elderly parents have fallen on my shoulders, and it's a burden I'm not confident I can handle."
