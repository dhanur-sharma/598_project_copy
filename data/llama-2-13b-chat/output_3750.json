        "Summarize the following story in first person: A couple months ago, I moved back to my favorite neighborhood. I lived in this neighborhood while attending college. After graduating college, I started working at a company, and also moved to another neighborhood for cheaper rent. That neighborhood was very far from my workplace and I had to spend 40 minutes on the subway each morning to get to work. My new neighborhood is technically closer to my workplace but unfortunately I have to spend an entire hour commuting now, because the closest subway station is 30 minutes away by foot! Now I walk 30 minutes and spend 30 minutes on the subway, for a total of one hour. Previously, I walked 4 minutes to the subway and spent around 35 minutes on the subway, for a total of about 40 minutes. So I lost out on the commute factor. I didn't realize this would happen. However, I love this neighborhood still. I am still glad I moved back. Even though I have to get up earlier, I enjoy the walk to the subway, because it is my favorite neighborhood after all. This long walk puts me in a good mood for the day. It's also good exercise. I like to eat, but I don't like to gain weight. I worked hard to make money over the past year to be able to afford my new (old) neighborhood)."
