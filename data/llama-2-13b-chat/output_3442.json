        "Summarize the following story in first person: I took my daughter to her first day of preschool. I remember being a knee clinger when I was a kid and I never enjoyed school. I was surprised that my daughter was gung-ho about the idea. She ran to school and I had to actually keep up with her. When we got there, she was all smiles and talked to everyone. I'm a bit of an introvert myself so it was unexpected to see her so extroverted with everyone. It was a soft-start to school, so I got to stay with her. She ran from station to station and was showing the other kids how everything was done. I barely had to do anything as she had it handled herself. She was especially fond of the play dough section. She spent most of her time there. After the \"free-reign\" time was up, she sat in the circle with the other children and sang a song about a greedy squirrel or something like that. She had a lot of fun and I was quite surprised at how well a toddler could do. The only downside was when I told her school was over and she cried. She thought that school was over FOREVER and she didn't like that at all. Fortunately, I explained that it was just the first day that was over and she had months of fun to look forward to. All in all, she did way better than I had hoped and taking her to school is actually quite enjoyable for me."
