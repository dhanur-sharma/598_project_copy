        "Summarize the following story in first person: My sister Jenn recently got herself a new laptop. I'm really not sure why she has chosen to do so since she already has a laptop and is constantly short on money towards the end of the month. I know she was able to get a payment plan for this one. But knowing her she is going to be late on those payments, resulting in late fees. Not to mention it is only a 12 month plan. Sometimes I think that Jenn just wants to have the newest and shiniest things to make herself feel better.  A kind of shopping therapy if you would. But I personally don't agree with this mindset. She should focus on long-term goals to feel better. The laptop is really nice though. And if I hadn't recently built myself a PC I would have considered getting one as well. The touchscreen function on it would be great for my digital art. It also has a decent graphics card so would be able to handle some of the games I enjoy playing. I also like the idea of being able to bring your computer anywhere. If I am laying in bed and get an urge to do something that requires a computer I have to get up and go into my office. I don't know. I guess I see why she would buy this. But I still very much stick to my she should be working on the long-term NOT the short-term...she also really needs to set herself a budget and stick to it."
