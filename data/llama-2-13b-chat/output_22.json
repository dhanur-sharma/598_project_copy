        "Summarize the following story in first person: A memorable event that I have recently had happen was when my four year old son had foot surgery this past Thursday. He was born with a condition called polydactylism, which means having extra fingers or toes. In my son's case, he was born with an extra pinky toe on his left foot. As a baby it was easier to manage, since babies obviously don't need shoes, but now as a preschooler his extra little toe would often hurt him while wearing tennis shoes. My husband and I always knew that he would need this surgery, but we were still worried when the day actually arrived. Neither he nor I, nor our older son, had ever needed surgery before. This was uncharted waters for us. When we arrived at the hospital Thursday morning, the nurses took his vitals to make sure he was healthy enough for surgery that day. Other than that, a lot of the time was just spent waiting. It made my husband and I feel sad because our son was hungry but he was not allowed to eat prior to the surgery. Thankfully the hospital did have a good amount of toys that helped keep him distracted. Finally around 12:30 in the afternoon he was taken back for his surgery. My husband and I were not allowed to go back with him, but the nurses and doctors made it fun for him by taking him back in a big push car. Once they got to the room, they put a small mask on his face with the strawberry scented gas he had picked out earlier. After he was asleep with the gas, they put the needle in his hand for the other anesthesia. Surgery only lasted about one hour. The nurse came to get my husband and I to take us to where our son was recovering. He's normally a really happy little guy, but unfortunately he was in a lot of pain and very confused coming out of his surgery. He ended up needing three shots of morphine in his IV to manage the discomfort. Thankfully it seemed to work quickly and soon we were on our way home. He seems to be recovering well and we're thankful his surgery was an over-all uneventful, yet memorable, experience."
