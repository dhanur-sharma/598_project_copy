        "Summarize the following story in first person: Sadness is a natural part of life as happiness is. As human I will have to taste every flavor of life whether I like it or not. And if anyone tries to escape from any flavor, he will not be rewarded with his favorite one happiness. If sadness would not be good, then why I go to watch emotional movies. These movies don\u2019t give me any smile or laughter rather they make my eyes wet. I like it because I enjoy being the part of character\u2019s sadness. It means I like being sad and wanna feel this emotion too. And so do you all. I listen to songs which make me cry and I love to indulge into the emotions of the song. Does that mean I love crying? Absolutely I do. Because sometimes I need tears more than the flattering lips. The smile is being so overrated and people have become obsessed for getting this ingredient on their plate. The energy put in suppressing the emotions bounce back with the equal reaction. The sorrow I try to escape from will come back and hurt me more. I believe in God, if God has given me tears and sadness there may be a reason behind that. There are so many variations in our feelings then why to get stuck in only one. However if I wanna fulfill my crave of happiness there are so many articles making my ways through it. There are so many people chasing it but, they aren\u2019t as happy as they show. They do feel dejected at times and if they pretend as if they are always happy don\u2019t believe them. They are as humans as you and I am. blessed to know this fact at this little age. Otherwise, I would have been naive like others and spend my whole life chasing something while missing others."
