        "Summarize the following story in first person: In May, my best friend graduated from medical school. We had gone to different colleges and different graduate programs so we rarely saw each other in person, maybe once or twice a year. We were from the same hometown but neither of us had lived there for over half a decade. I wanted to attend her graduation but it coincided with my younger brother's high school graduation so I couldn't go. She did invite me to her graduation party though. The party was a pretty big deal. My friend is African and when they party, they really party. Her relatives had flown in from Cameroon just for this party. There must have been at least one hundred people there. I got to catch up with some other classmates from high school who I hadn't seen in a while too. After we had eaten, my friend and her family made speeches to the room. My friend, as the guest of honor, had the spotlight speech. Unexpectedly, she talked about me in her speech and my own accomplishments. She told a room full of people about proud she was of me. I had no idea beforehand she was going to say this. I wasn't really sure what to do in the moment. But I did feel extremely grateful that I was important enough to her to be singled out among all the other guests. It really reinforced the bond we've had for over ten years. I hope that ten years from now, we will still support and uplift each other like this."
