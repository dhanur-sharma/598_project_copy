        "Summarize the following story in first person: My little boy started kindergarten about three weeks ago. G, as I like to call him (for Little G), loves it. But three weeks ago as I dropped him off, was absolutely terrifed. He could tell too. He kept tell me, \"It's ok daddy, I will be fine.\" I dropped him off in the kindergarten class at 9:00. The teacher let all of us worry wort parents linger for a time. G kept waving to me and smiling. He was having a such a great time. I finally left after about an hour. After I picked him up that day, he told me all about how much fun he had and what a wonderful time he had. The last three weeks have been such a great experience. G loves his class. His teacher and his classmates are wonderful. He always talks of all the things he's learned. He even comes home singing the songs he's learned."
