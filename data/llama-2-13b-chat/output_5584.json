        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was a beautiful spring day. The sun was shining so I thought I'd take the long way back from class - the way that winds through the field. After all it was dry so I shouldn't have any problem. In fact, I should really enjoy myself. I had my Airpods out with me while I was walking. I thought that I'd enjoy listening to some of my favorite music. However, before I could put them on my phone rang. It was my mom so I knew I had to talk to her. In my rush to grab my phone everything became a blur and somehow I managed to loose my Airpods. I didn't realize that I'd lost my Airpods until I reached the dorm. Once inside I saw one of my classmates and we struck up a conversation. We sat down on the couch and I started putting things away. This is when I realized that I didn't know where my Airpods were - that I'd lost them somewhere in the field I was walking through while on the phone with my Mom. My classmate and I headed out to look for them. Thank God we found them."
