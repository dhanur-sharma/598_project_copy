        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was quite a long drive but I was finally glad to pull into my uncle's massive driveway on a brisk Friday night. I instantly saw dozens of cars, some of which I recognized and others that I could not place. Regardless, it was clear that our big reunion was already underway. If the lines of cars didn't give it away, then it was the smell of burgers, brats, and hot dogs coming from a nearby grill, where my uncle held court. After setting up my tent and then making small talk with numerous groups of relatives that I had not seen in a while, I walked over to the food tables and grabbed myself something to eat. Before I could even grab the bun for my burger, my closest cousin tapped me on the shoulder and handed me an ice cold beer. Obviously he knew I love IPAs, and this was a local brew from near his house which I had never tried before. After quickly scarfing down the burger and talking with my cousin for a few minutes, we both walked over the to massive bonfire on the front lawn. There must have been 20 relatives already sitting around it, with maybe six or seven different conversations all flowing simultaneously. In many ways it was nostalgic, and I instantly felt at ease around so many of my family and friends. Throughout the night I made a handful more trips to the food table for random snacks and probably more than a handful of trips to the beer coolers. Eventually some of the chairs that housed relatives became empty as we sat by the fire telling stories and remembering great times from the past, and before I knew it I was one of just four cousins left awake when the fire started to finally die out. We knew that our grandma's homemade donuts would be ready for us bright and early in the morning, so we agreed to call it a night and retreat to our tents. The next morning, as expected, we were treated to a glorious spread of fresh donuts decorated in just about every variety possible. Though I was unable to stay a second night due to work obligations, I was thrilled with my short time with my family for our yearly get-together. It's rare to have a group of people so care-free and fun to be around, and I will always cherish the time we have been able to spend together each year for this special event."
