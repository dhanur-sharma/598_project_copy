        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was a sunny Alaskan day in the brooks range.  I saddled up 12 dogs and headed out on a training run.  My training runs with the dogs were between 5-10 miles because that\u2019s what I typically took the guests on.  The sun was so bright the snow was a perfect texture for the dogs to get some speed.  We took off fast and ran Ahead of pace majority of the run.  I decided to take A break at one of my favorite spots where the trail meets the river.  As I looked out to my amazement I saw a baby moose struggling through the snow.  A minute later I spotted the mom moose not far behind.  I sat very calm and still so the dogs didn\u2019t get alarmed. Next, I heard a strange sound I hadn\u2019t heard before.  As I looked out I saw something trotting through the woods, not far from the moose.  To my surprise it was a lynx.  Lynx are a pretty rare sight as they are very sneaky.  I noticed another lynx not far behind the first one, it was an amazing sight.  Before the dogs noticed I gave the call and we took off.  We continued the rest of the trail fast with a smile."
