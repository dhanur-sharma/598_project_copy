        "Summarize the following story in first person: My wedding day was at the beggining of the year and though it wasnt all that i ecpected it was still a nice day and one that i will always remember. We got married in the court house that my husband worked on while he was roofing. My grandparents where the only ones able to come. They waited in the lobby with our youngest son who was just 2 months at the time while we took our 5 year old upstairs with us for the ceremony. It was short and simple. I wish that more family could have come to share the day with us but it was special and will be something t beat when we get our vows renewed in the future. When I was younger I did imagine me to at least have a nice white dress and a bridesmaid in a church. The fact that it wasnt in a church did bother me a little, and i wore a regular but nice red dress i got on sale for $40. I would have loved to have flowers because my husband always brings me red roses. Being that it was in between our birthdays will be nice for a anniversary. I am thankful that my kids where there. I am thankful that my grandparents where present. I am thankful to be able to legally marry my husband. And I am thankful that it was a nice day. In the future I will be thankful."
