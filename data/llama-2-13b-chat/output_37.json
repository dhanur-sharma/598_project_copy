        "Summarize the following story in first person: It happened about a week and a half ago, I never knew I could be so open and that I could actually enjoy such a company. So my friends birthdays was definitely a highlight of the last month, I still have some good memories about it and I smile every time I do. This even showed me different sides of of and what I could be and in this sense it is significant and I would even say life changing.  Some of the other things that I remember is playing darts with people I never met before, we had fun and I felt connected just playing this simple game. I also remember meeting a cute girl, she a blond hair and her name was Anabel, I felt like I known her for ages for some reason, maybe it was the music that made me feel nostalgic but probably it was just a dejavu. The birthdays itself lasted for two days, since it stated on the weekend and my friend could afford an even longer holiday. There were a lot of fun thing to do and the food was amazing, my favorite dish was pizza of course, it was a real Italian pizza from some high end catering service. Also the fresh sashimi was great and tasty. The music was great and the DJ did a great job adjusting to our mood and taking guest requests into consideration. So this birthday was more of a concert than a typical home birthday I am used to and expected to experience.  There were some people whom I've know since I was a kid and it was a very pleasant meeting since we haven't seen each other for ages.  At midnight there was a fireworks show and not like a small fireworks that you can buy anywhere on Halloween but an actual commercial grade fireworks which were huge and loud like it was a major holiday or something, so I really enjoyed that part since you don't see that too often in a common weekend. Since it was a two day celebration and since my friend has a big house, most guests could just stay overnight in one of the bedrooms, it made us all feel even closer and the next morning I felt even more connected to the new people I have met the previous day as well as to my old childhood friends.  Overall it was one of the best birthday celebrations in my life and I really enjoyed it and will probably remember it for a long time if not till the rest of my life.  It was his 30th birthday and I guess that's why he decided to do on such a large scale and many of us felt grateful for that, especially since we knew what a good and kind person he was and this wasn't even necessary for us to start thinking of him even better."
