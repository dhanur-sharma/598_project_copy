        "Summarize the following story in first person: 22 weeks ago, I was diagnosed with a rare immune disease, prior to that I wondered why I had been feeling funny. Your body is usually trying to tell you something when things aren't working right or when the body is being attacked. I finally felt like it was time to go see a doctor because this wasn't normal for my body to be feeling like this. I went into the doctors office and sat down; I was very nervous about this day. The waiting room was filled with other sick people. However I did not look sick as the other patients, but I felt very exhausted. I finally went back to speak with the doctor and told him all of my symptoms, as I was telling him I felt like a weight was lifted off of my shoulders only to be exchanged for this other burden to be placed upon them. I took some labs and a few blood test and waited in the room as the test were examined. The doctor came back and said \"You have a rare disease\", I was floored. Everything seemed to be going in slow motion as the doctor was talking about what the disease was, I did not even hear him tell me what it was. I was thinking if it was a fatal disease, or if it would change my quality of life. I just shook my head and the doctor tried to calm me by saying \"don,t worry we will do our best to help!\" I left and went and picked up my prescriptions. I sat at home by myself staring into the nothingness of my emotions thinking about what will become of me and my newly discovered disease. I turned on a gospel sermon to listen to and coincidentally it the sermon had to do with unforeseen circumstance and how to deal with them. The pastor said that \"these circumstances aren't here to hold you back; but here to propel you forward to your purpose.\" I felt a lot better and started thinking of my new purpose and why I was chosen to have this rare disease. I knew that I would have to change a lot of my habits and make better decisions for my health. I sat down and made a list of things I would need to change and a list of things I have always wanted to achieve. I finally figured out that in exchange for this disease my dream of becoming a public speaker was coming in to fruition. I decided then and there that I wanted to be a public speaker for my rare disease. And from there things started to change for the better."
