        "Summarize the following story in first person: On Saturday I had the absolute most perfect day at the fair with my friends. The weather was a little overcast so we were worried about rain, but it was fantastic all day. At the beginning it wasn't even very crowded, so my partner and my friend and I were able to get our first few fair foods quickly and without much fuss. We had some amazing nitro ice cream - it was smooth as butter! Right afterward we went straight for the pronto pups - a bit of a line, but worth it. I wanted to check out the skateboarding exhibitions and we saw some really amazing riding from 12 and 13 year old kids. We browsed about some of the stalls before we met up with a couple more friends, and then all of us roamed around eating everything in sight and taking it all in. We saw the beautiful butter sculptures and some really cool knitted horses. We visited all the animal barns to see the fun creatures city kids normally don't get to interact with. I absolutely love cows, sheep, and even those big porkers! We even got to see a bit of a cow judging show! My friend took some amazing pictures. The best part was getting a big bucket of multi-flavor cheese curds and eating all of them between four people. We could barely finish them and at the end, with one curd of each flavor left, we took out the separators and played Curd Roulette. I got the jalepeno one. It was delicious and so are all my memories of the fair with my friends."
