        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 2 1/2 months ago, I got married to the love of my life and my best friend. After dating for over 4 years, almost strictly long distance, it was the most amazing experience to finally get to marry her. We got married at a Temple in Utah, and it was an absolutely beautiful venue. Most of our immediate family was there, along with some of our very good friends and extended family members. One of my best friends was able to come to the ceremony, and both my wife and I were surprised a how excited and happy he was throughout the entire ceremony and reception. We took some photos after the ceremony, and our photographer was intent on getting the perfect photos. We had a large and very well-decorated venue for the reception. We had the perfect cake (that tasted as good as it looked) and a wonderful luncheon for all of the adults in attendance. Both my and my wife's parents got up and said a few words about us and our relationship over the years. We met when we were just teenagers, but we knew we wanted to be together all those years until we finally made it happen. She stayed with me even during a two year stint I spent in New York City, during which I was never able to visit and barely even got to talk with her. Our parents recounted several memories about us personally and together. My now brother-in-law, who was my best friend through high school and how I met my wife in the first place, was my best man. He also stood and said a few words, and it was very surprising how emotional he got as he spoke. He almost cried! I had never seen him get emotional about, well, anything! As we drove away from the reception, we just smiled on our way to our hotel. It was the greatest experience of my life to date, and will always be a fond memory for me."
