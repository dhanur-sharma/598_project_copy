I have no problems with MRI's though.  It was honestly kind of relaxing.  I am lucky that I am not claustrophobic.  Getting an MRI done can be very helpful.  It can help your doctors determine what is causing symptoms.  MRI stands for Magnetic Resonance Imaging. It uses a magnetic field and radio waves to make images. I have not heard the results yet.  I am not too worried because my symptoms have not been getting worse.  I trust my doctors and MRIs.  I am not sure how expensive a MRI would be without insurance.  Luckily I had insurance to cover it."
