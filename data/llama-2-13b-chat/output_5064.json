        "Summarize the following story in first person: So I have always been one of the most active people I know.  I don't really like to have to sit down for long I just like to stay active. Doing things just helps my mind stay clear of doubt and worry. Those things when thought about could become very hard from some to deal with. Unfortunatly about 6 months ago I ended up getting into a bad accident. It was terrible because it was totally unexpected no one was looking forward to this issue. I ended up breaking my ankle in that accident which caused me a lot of issues. I basically had to learn how to walk again. after spending almost all of my time being alive walking and running that had came to a halt. I couldn't do those things anymore it was hard for me to do. Learning how to walk again after a personal tragedy is no small feat. It's crazy to think maybe one day this could happen. It changes your mindset and makes you see things in a whole new way. I know now to be carefull and stay safe at all times. I couldn't imagine having to go through this again."
