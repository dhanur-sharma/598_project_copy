        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was St. Patrick's Day and my friend and I had nothing better to do for the night.  We decided to have a little fun and go to the casino.  My friend had never been to one before so I thought it would be fun to show her the ropes.  I had been there all the time, ever since I was a teen.  My parents love to go to the casinos so I would tag along with them back then.  We both thought we'd have some fun gambling our money away instead of getting drunk at a bar.  So, we get to the casino and find some slot machines to put some money in.  We spent a few hours just letting the machines eat our coins up.  We weren't winning anything at all.  After that, we got some food at the restaurant inside the casino and decided we would continue with the slots.  There has to be a winner sometime soon, right?  No sooner than I put my first coin in, I realized I had won!  And not just a small chunk of change, either.  I won $10,000!  As you can imagine, I did get a lot of jokes about the luck of the Irish being with me all night long, even though I'm not Irish.  I did end up giving my friend some of the money because she was a good sport about coming to the casino with me.  It turned out to be a fun night after all!"
