        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was fired from my last job due to no fault of my own. They thought I started that fight, but I was only defending myself. Desperate for money, I took a gig at a construction company installing roofs. This time I felt like I needed to get out of this situation. I've been in debt longer than I can imagine. I worked hard. I took many 12 hour shifts trying to just make ends meet. I finally got an apartment in the better part in town and was able to pay off some medical bills. I decided to attend university via online classes. For many years it was painful. I just grinded every day and it seemed like the last. Eventually though, a few years later, I got a degree in management. I was finally able to move up in my company. I am thankful that I pushed myself so hard. The 12 hour shifts with night classes finally was over. I was able to relax and make more money as well."
