        "Summarize the following story in first person: [12:02 PM, 8/26/2019] Debman: back a year prior, to the march or 2019. My cousin, the son of my mother\u2019s oldest sister, has gotten engaged. It\u2019s the first engagement of all the cousins on my mom\u2019s side \u2014 granted, there are only two cousins outside of myself, my brother and my sister. Still, it\u2019s enough to be hot, hot family news and send us into a collective, year-long planning mode: How do we get to the wedding, what do we wear to the wedding, where do we stay for the wedding, what do we do before and after the wedding? The wedding becomes what we plan our lives around.[12:04 PM, 8/26/2019] Debman: It\u2019s not that we\u2019re crazy, wedding-obsessed people. It\u2019s that my cousin\u2019s wedding is in Shanghai, China. Both of my parents are from Shanghai. Most of my mom\u2019s family is still in Shanghai, and my cousin who is getting married lives with my aunt and my uncle and my grandmother in the same house that my mother grew up in as a child. My family also lived in Shanghai for nearly two years when I was around 8 and 9 years old, and visited again a year later. But I had not been back since. And not only had I not been back, but in that 13-year separation, I had forgotten the bulk of Chinese I had ever known how to speak. Instead of focusing on re-learning the language in the year I had, I shoved it to the bottom of my mental to-do list. By the time December 2012 rolled aroun[12:11 PM, 8/26/2019] Debman: I was no better at remembering how to say \u201cWhere is the bathroom?\u201d than 12 months earlier. When we finally arrived in Shanghai, the reality of being in China\u2019s largest city began to settle in. On the streets, taxis weaved in and out of lanes, miraculously avoiding crashes by near inches. People crowded the sidewalks, pushing others to get by and rushing across busy streets, also miraculously avoiding getting hit by cars. Buses honked. Street vendors hollered. We spent a day getting over the jet lag before the wedding. We saw my cousin and the rest of the family. We ate a lot of food in a short amount of time. And to be honest, by the morning of the wedding day, I wasn\u2019t too worried about not being able to speak Chinese. My family had been assigned a big table[12:18 PM, 8/26/2019] Debman: together, and we could enjoy the wedding with each other."
