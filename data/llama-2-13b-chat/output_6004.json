        "Summarize the following story in first person: About twelve weeks ago, my husband and I decided to head down to Miami. I wanted to see my sister and surprise her on her birthday. Seeing the rest of the family was also a big plus. Because the family is kind of spread out around the country, we don't get to see each other as often as we would like. We decided to drive down instead of flying so we could make it into more of a road trip. I found that part of it to be very relaxing. Seeing all of the sites along the way was a great experience. When we finally arrived in Miami we immediately set out to get the surprise party worked out. It really paid off. I don't think I've ever seen my sister so surprised or happy when we all yelled Surprise and turned on the lights when she opened the door. There were three different cakes and each one was more delicious than the last. The chocolate cake was my personal favorite. The entire night, you couldn't pry the smile off of my sister's face. She was talking a mile a minute and was just beaming the whole time. Overall, it was a great trip for us and the family as well."
