        "Summarize the following story in first person: I came home from work a bit early since it wasn't busy, and I found my wife sitting at the dining room table.  This was a little strange, since I would usually find her on the couch watching television. She asked me to sit, which I figured could either mean good or bad news.  I obliged, and she set a pregnancy test on top of a paper towel that had been placed on the table in front of me.  It indicated that she was pregnant.  I wasn't sure how to feel.  I was excited, but nervous. This certainly was not a planned event. But regardless of how I felt, I needed to deal with it as best I could.  My take home pay was just enough to cover our existing lifestyle, and now I would have to purchase diapers, baby food, clothing, and all of the other baby-related items.  Our medical bills would increase.  It was stressful. However, I knew we could handle it, as we had before.  My job was quite flexible, and I could work more hours and bring home more pay.  My wife could work online - she was a medical transcriptionist before she quit to take care of our first child, and her company offered to keep her employed on a part-time basis if she ever needed the work.  It was a big life change, but I knew everything was going to be alright."
