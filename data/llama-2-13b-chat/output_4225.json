        "Summarize the following story in first person: Three months ago I was asked if I had time to be a Big Brother for a co-worker's son. There is nothing about the job I do for my employer that would qualify me for such a responsibility. But I was told by the parent they see something in me that assures them I could play a valuable role as a friend and mentor to the boy, whose father abandoned him and his mother two years prior and hasn't been heard from since. I wasn't quite sure I could fulfill a commitment to her son. But was flattered she would ask me and I found it difficult to tell her no. I agreed to meet her son the following weekend and we would allow him to make the choice of whether he wanted to spend time with me. The mother was being careful not to decide for her son that he should consider me a mentor. The following weekend I arrived at my co-worker's home to meet her son. He was only 12 years old but he expressed a fondness for my car I would ordinarily expect from a teenager. My car is a 2019 Ford Mustang. My car is as close I've come to something precious to me, for I have never had children of my own. The boy was eager to go for a ride in my car. And with his mother's urging, we took a short drive. He was very curious about the specifications of the engine and features. He operated the satellite radio while he fired off questions he had about the vehicle. He touched the interior surfaces and commented on how nice and new the car was. He liked the seats, the controls and even marveled at the dashboard sensor gauges. I was pleased the ride was a pleasant experience for him and admired his well-behaved demeanor. I took him back home and thanked him and his mother for the introduction. I agreed to come back the next weekend and continue this role as a Big Brother. It had turned out to be an experience I had no expectation of personal satisfaction, yet that is exactly how I felt when the visit was over."
