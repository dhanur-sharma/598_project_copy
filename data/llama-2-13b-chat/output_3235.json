        "Summarize the following story in first person: Two weeks ago, I lost a huge amount of money in the money market. For the past year, I'd been thinking about buying a house with the intention of flipping it. I liked the idea of taking something, applying hard work to it, and then selling it for a profit. The only problem was that I had difficulty getting a loan. My credit isn't the best. I had a decent chunk of money I'd saved monthly from my paycheck, but it wasn't enough for the down payment. Then my friend, Thomas, told me about the money market. He said he'd been playing the market for about a year now and had made over $100K. It sounded good to me, and I never do anything without researching it carefully first, so I spent the next four months learning the ins and outs of the market. About 2 months ago, I was feeling pretty confident and invested all of the money I had saved from my paycheck (about $15K) in the market. It wasn't long before it started paying off. I guess I got lucky, because I had doubled my money! Then it tripled! It was like a dream come true. I had enough to make the down payment on the house, but then I got thinking. If I keep this going I won't have to flip the house at all. I can just sit here and let the money keep growing! I hadn't lost yet, so, 2 weeks ago, I took all of the money I'd made so far and invested it back in the market. I had a pleasant weekend and then Money morning I checked the market performance. It was gone. My money was all gone! I seriously hadn't expected it at all and the outcome hit me like a ton of bricks. I'd lost so much money, and now I don't have anything for a down payment for the house. I don't know what I'm going to do now."
