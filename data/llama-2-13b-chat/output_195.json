        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 2 months ago I got a call from aunt jane. \"Lucinda joined a cult\". Those were the first things I heard out of her mouth.  I didnt quite understand, but Jane told me that Lucy's boyfriend garret got her involved with his \"church\". The church promotes well being through their lord of opportunity which only the worthy are saved. In order to prove worthiness you are to let your body deteriorate. You only eat when you are allotted food, which is about twice a week in meager portions. Bathing, cleaning, grooming are all strictly prohibited. Any contact with family or attempts to break free are temptations that the lord does not look kindly on. Jane went over to lucys house and said she had lost significant weight, looked unkempt, and the house was a mess. She was informed by garret that Lucy couldnt speak to family on grounds of initiation. She called the police bu they informed her that they cannot do anything as she is doing this of her own free will. I never knew such cults existed and don't know what to do now. Lucy was always so normal and has become something else because of garret. I can only hope that she will come to her senses and take care of herself. She has lost her way and hopefully finds it again before it kills her."
