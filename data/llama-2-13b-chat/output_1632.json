        "Summarize the following story in first person: A moment that will stay with me forever was the day I finally met my long lost sister. We were separated at a very young age and I never really knew much about them. I used to ask my parents what was she like and if they knew how and what she was doing. Hearing them talk about what her just made me so eager and excited to one day hopefully actually meet her. So one day I decided to go ahead and do some digging to try and find her and see if we could speak. Sadly I came up with no results and that was kind of heartbreaking at the time because I just felt that if I couldn't find her then, I would never actually meet up with her. So I felt gutted for that but in a turn of events, I was sent a message from someone she knew. I instantly replied and we got something set up. My sister and I had a conversation and it was so amazing for me because I always had so many questions. She answered every question I had and she definitely had questions for me. I was more than happy to answer any and everything she wanted to know about me, because that's my sister. So for me this was a great time over-time though we ended up planning a face to face meeting and we met the airport. We embraced and had a big long hug and we both cried actually. I was literally shaking because I thought I would never actually see my sister ever and make memories with her while we were older. This was a moment for me that I plan on never forgetting until the day I'm no longer around."
