        "Summarize the following story in first person: After being diagnosed with shingles and low sodium, I was told to eat more salt and put on pain killers and a medication for nerve pain.  The combination of the two medications made it impossible for me to drive myself anywhere, for the entire time I was on these medications, my roommate drove me everywhere I needed to go.  Even after I no longer was taking the narcotic based pain pills, the medication for nerve pain was still strong enough that I could not drive.  Although it doesn't affect everyone the same way, it made me always feel like I had had a little too much to drink, or was slightly high.  At one point during this time period, my daughter asked me to come to a nearby city and stay with her and my two granddaughters at a hotel while they did some shopping.  To do this, I had to not take the nerve pain medication before making the 2 1/2 hour drive.  I did this, and as the medication left my system, the pain in my arm and shoulder from the healing shingles became overwhelming.  I ended up having to make the drive home again, and doubled up on the medication after I got here to make the intense pain manageable.  For two solid months, I was on either the combination of medications, or just the nerve pain medication.  For two solid months I was unable to drive myself to the doctor, grocery shopping, or anywhere else.  For two solid months, I spent every single day feeling slightly high or drunk!  The nerve pain medication sure made me sleep well though! If I learned anything from this incident, it's how much I can depend on my wonderful roommate!  We have been friends for probably 7 or 8 years now, and have been roommates for almost three.  He is my best friend, my partner on my homestead, and will probably be my roommate for the rest of my life, or as long as I can continue to take care of myself.  He is truly a blessing in my life!"
