We were on tue fast track up and tyen in a blink of an eye it was taken from us. Having tyree kids to support right and school time it is very hard to figure out what to do next. It affected our whole famoly. We feel like it was planned and done on purpose. Now we are leftto figure out how to pay bills and provide for our children with no money. We live in a place where jobs are rare. He worked so hard to keep this job. Stress keeps building up with no outlet. We ask ourselves what we are going to do. Money is not suppose to be everything but it makes the world go round. And tye will not even release a statement saying he was terminated so our family can get help. Its like a cycle of distruction that wont stop. Whays next?"
