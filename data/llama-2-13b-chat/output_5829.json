        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last June I was scheduled to have surgery at a place I use to work. it had has a spot where you can park a motor home or trailer while you are receiving treatment at the hospital. Security handles registration of vehicles and it is a free service. There was another vehicle in the parking lot. It was an older motorhome. It had 5 to 7 barking dogs in it and a pile of garbage behind it that was 6 feet high. There were two adults in it that seemed to argue with each other all the time. Behind the pile of garbage was a trail that led to a creek and garbage was scattered all along the trail. There were many large bear tracks, these people had a bear baiting station right in the parking lot. We went to register our trailer and get settled in. Once we find the security office they yell at us because we did not have the registration to our trailer with us. We had called them twice earlier in the month and they had never mentioned that we would need anything. They just said just find a place to park and come talk to us. Since I had a pre-op doctor appointment I had to leave and let my husband take care of the registration. While I was at the doctor's office, my husband text me that they had called the police and they were going to have him arrested for trying to park a stolen trailer.  Twenty minutes later he text me that he and the police had it all straightened out and he was able to prove it was our trailer and not stolen. My husband was headed to the trailer with the appropriate placards for the trailer and was going to finally get settled in. Then we needed to report the garbage and bear baiting area. So my husband went back to talk to security and they said they would take care of it. But no one came.  So after no one showed up for two days the police happened to be talking to an upset person in the area. So once they were done dealing with her my husband went over to talk to the police and had them look at the pile of garbage. They called the hospital security people and had them come look at it. That came and went and nothing happened. So after I was discharged from the hospital I contacted two of my former nursing friends who were now supervisors and the mess was cleaned up that day."
