        "Summarize the following story in first person: Approximately 6 months ago we made the decision to sell our home and build another one with all of the things we wanted. I had recently gotten a significant promotion at work and we knew that with the economy being the way it was, it was as good a time as ever to make this move. Whenever we talked about our wishes for our future home, we always knew we wanted a view. There was some land being prepared for some new houses to be built on in our current neighborhood. The way it was set up, we knew that there would never be the ability to have new construction block the view of the lot we wanted to purchase, meaning we would always have the view we wanted. With the market being the way it is, our house sold quickly and we needed to move into temporary residence until the new home construction was completed. We chose to rent a duplex in our current neighborhood so that the kids school would not be affected. This was going to be an exciting adventure for them! We had secured all the loans and funding in addition to the money from the sale of our house to purchase the new home and were all set to get going on the build. There ended up being a very bad weather pattern that settled in our area for weeks. The land we wanted was on a pretty steep hill and as it turns out the water run off washed away a good part of the hill during this unusual weather pattern. We backed out of the deal and decided to keep looking for a different location to build. I had gone to work the next week and as it turns out my new position at work was offering me an opportunity to relocate with better pay! The new job was located in California, just 20 minutes away from Disneyland! We talked it over as a family and ultimately made the decision to start this new adventure over in a whole new place! We were all so excited!"
