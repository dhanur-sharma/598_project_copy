        "Summarize the following story in first person: Two weeks ago I finally took my first international vacation! First, I went to Auckland New Zealand, because I love Lord of the Rings more than life itself. My friend Eric was with me, he's almost as big of a fan as I am. I hadn't seen him in a few years, not since we graduated from Community College together, because he moved back to Sydney, Australia. First, we visited the shire, they wouldn't let us into the hobbit houses, but that's okay. Just getting to be there, surrounded by the mountains and scenery and sets from the movies was probably the best thing i'll ever experience. I can't believe how well they've maintained the sets in the almost two decades since the movie came out. Everything was so green and vibrant, we had so much fun. After going to the LoTR park, we got to see Flight of the Conchords! I can't believe they were in town, and the tickets ate up a bunch of my budget, but I don't care. Hearing Business Time and The Most Beautiful Girl live was so funny, Brett and Jemaine will always be two of my favorite musicians. We spent about a week seeing the other sites, it's such a beautiful country! Australia is on fire right now, it was so unbearably hot and smokey that we mostly sat around and played video games while getting stoned. We spent a lot of time catching up, talking about all the things that aren't so easy to talk about over Facebook Messenger. I got to meet his friends and his parents, and I think they liked me. We did get to go to a zoo, all the animals seemed tired and worn out from the heat. I finally got to see a koala and they're just as cute as in the pictures. Kangroos are the assholes everyone always says they are. All in all, it was almost as cool as NZ. I hope I can go and visit NZ and Australia again in the future, this was probably he best vacation i'll ever take."
