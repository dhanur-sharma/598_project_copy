        "Summarize the following story in first person: In May of 2019 I decided it was the right time to take a trip via airplane to visit my mom and sister that share a home in Las Vegas Nevada. The last time I went to visit was in November of 2017 a few months after my mom suffered from a stroke. After that visit I was very depressed and was and still am suffering from PTSD. Before the trip in 2017 we were still recovering from dealing withthe after effects from hurricane Irma. So I felt the time was right to go and see how my mom is doing as far as progressing for myself as I had heard other stories from my siblings. I figured the end of May was great as my children were done with school and my husband had time in his schedule to take vacation. We flew an airling that we have never flown because it was less costly and it was actually the only airline that had enough seats left for our family to sit together. We also flew out of an airport that we never ever fly out of. These two things alone were like an adventure for us because they were new experiences. I won't mention the shuttle driver that kept swerving in the other lane getting us to the airport as that was extremely scary and angering for me and I let the shuttle driver know that as well.  Back to the trip, we arrived in Las Vegas at my families home and it was around 3 in the morning (late flight). I was exhausted as we are on a time difference and gave my sister a hug and looked towards her piull out sofa to see my mom and her tiny frail body laying done. I went over and gave my mom a hug and kiss and told my kids and husband to say hello and give her a hug. They were not use to seeing her in that condition and were taken aback or nervous. I spent six days, four of which were full time hands on with my mom, getting her up, dressed, back and forth to the bathroom, cooking breakfast, lunch dinner as well as snacks. My plan was to do some work on my laptop but that did not happen. My mom is healthy, she just has issues with mobility since her stroke. When it was time to leave I did not feel sad as I did in 2017. I felt okay as I knew my mom was healthy she just needs more therapy and a part time nurse to relieve my sister of duties. My sister does alot and I left with a new found respect for her and a bit of a relief that I was going back to my normal life and that my mom overall is healthy and will be okay."
