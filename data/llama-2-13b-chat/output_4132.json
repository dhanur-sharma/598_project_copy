        "Summarize the following story in first person: A few months ago I went with my girlfriend to Vermont for the weekend. It was the dreaded \"meet the parents\" trip. We had been putting it off for a few weeks, so we had to finally bite the bullet and get it over with. I was definitely nervous heading into it, since I'm not usually too great at these things. But my girlfriend put me at ease fairly well on our drive there, so I was calm. Staying at her parent's house seemed like it would be quite uncomfortable since we have never met, but they were extremely friendly and and made me feel at home right away. Her mom made spaghetti and meatballs for dinner on Friday, and we ended up going out to a fancy restaurant on Saturday. For the record those meatballs were probably the best I've ever had too. Later on Saturday we went to a hip comedy club and had a blast watching a number of under-the-radar comics perform. I didn't expect her parents to be the type for comedy clubs, so it was a pleasant surprise. Before we left on Sunday we had a big breakfast that we all contributed to making. I made the eggs but screwed up and burnt them slightly. I felt like an idiot but was glad nobody mentioned anything. All in all our trip was worth having, and I'm glad I could meet her parents over a few days. We will be seeing them again for Thanksgiving coming up this year, so it will be nice to spend some more time with them."
