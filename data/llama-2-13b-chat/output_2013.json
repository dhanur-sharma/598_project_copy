        "Summarize the following story in first person: A friend of mine asked me to volunteer at a race she was involved. She asked me to help hand out water, direct people and pretty much just be a a Jill of all trades during the race. I agreed, mainly because she is a good friend and I wanted to keep her, and helped out during the running of the marathon race. I watched the runners when they passed by during the race and thought that I could do that if I trained. I decided, for no real reason other than it was a challenge, to train for and complete a marathon. After my decision I looked up online what the best ways of training for a long distance race were and started to implement them. I trained for a little less than a year. I ran in rain, heat, snow and, worst of all, ice. I hate the winter and detest being cold but I went out and did the work anyway. I had always been athletic, playing sports in college and staying in shape at the gym over the years, but training by myself for a marathon was an entirely different level of fitness. There were days that I literally had to talk myself into training. I would hype myself up, out loud, to make myself go run in the cold. I am sure my husband thought I was crazy as he would come into a room and I would be talking, loudly, to myself to force myself into going out and running 15 miles. There were moments that were sublime, moments that were horrendous but overall, when I ran the race I thought all the training was worth it. I was proud that I had set a goal and completed it all while making my 4 year old daughter a part of the process. I made sure my daughter knew my goal and was there to watch me cross the finish line so she would know that she could set a goal herself, work hard and accomplish that goal. The race itself was more a part of the process as opposed to being the goal."
