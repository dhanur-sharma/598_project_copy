        "Summarize the following story in first person: My wife went to Germany this past spring for a study abroad program through her school. We live with another roommate who was here with my while my wife was away. One night I got a phone call from my landlord asking me if she can come over in the morning and perform some long needed maintenance on the bathroom. I'm usually a night person but I was set my alarm for 8 AM, excited for our shower to finally be repaired. I always keep my phone on silent and when my alarm goes off at 8 AM I notice I received a text message in the middle of the night from my roommate. The text read: \"lol who's the drunk snoring guy?\" I thought nothing of the message, seeing as we live close to downtown in a city that has a huge homeless crisis. Many nights I'm awakened by people screaming crazy shit as they walk past my house. I assumed a drunk guy fell asleep outside the house and she could hear him snoring from her room. Before the landlord arrives, I need to move my cat's kitty litter from the bathroom and bring it upstairs. I walk down the stairs and notice around the corner there's a dirty shoes hanging off the couch like somebody is laying there. I peak around the corner and what do you know it's the snoring drunk guy. Panic flushes over me as I realize that's not somebody my roommate invited in. I look at the doors, both are locked. No windows are broken. I go through all these different scenarios in my mind about who the person could be. Maybe it's an old tenant who knows my wife and still has a key. Maybe it was the maintenance guy that'd be helping my landlord that morning and he got here too early and decided to take a nap. I walk back up the stairs and wake up my roommate telling her I have no idea who the drunk snoring guy is. She's just as startled as me, assuming the guy was a friend of mine, but also much braver as she grabs an empty wine bottle next to her in case she needs to bludgeon anybody. She gets up in the sleeping guy's face and wakes him up with questions about who he is and why he's here. He looks just as startled as the both of us. Apparently, he came in through the kitchen window in the middle of the night, drunk as hell, thinking it was his friend's(our back neighbor's) house. He apologizes profusely and is super sweet and tells us he did this before at another neighbor's(\"the lady with all the cats and shit everywhere's) house."
