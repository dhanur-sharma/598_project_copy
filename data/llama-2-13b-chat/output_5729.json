My parents wanted to raise me to be super religious, but I wasn't feeling it. They insisted they wanted me to follow my own path. That was a commendable thing for them to do. But it certainly didn't stay that way. I thought they were going to be supportive of me, but then they do a complete reversal. They deliberately shut me out of their life. They went back on their word. The two people I thought I could trust, I couldn't trust anymore. I was disowned for not wanting to be manipulated into something I didn't believe in. I am in awe at the stance they took. They took belief in someone that wasn't their own child. Imagine not wanting to support your child."
