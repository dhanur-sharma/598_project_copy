        "Summarize the following story in first person: There were many events happening in my life. The most memorable event in my life is the trip I took to Japan and stayed there for one month in last summer vacation.  I went to Tokyo that was located in the middle of Japan. It is a big city in Japan with a large population and a convenient public transportation system.  I had learned Japanese for two years before,  therefore, decided to go to Japan to experience a true Japanese life there.  My school helps me find a wonderful home stay. The family members are not a big one, including only mother, father, and three young boys. On the weekend, my home father took us to the department store for shopping. I love the time that we got together.   We all learned Japanese together every day. It was really interesting because I had never seen people with brown hair and green eyes speak Japanese. The teacher would take us to travel around Tokyo, introduce Japanese culture for us, and sometimes hung out with us together to have a dinner date. I felt so lucky that I could meet those amazing classmates in Japan. There are many differences between Taiwan and Japan, such as the directions, eating habits, time of business, and manners. I had been told that Japanese the most polite people in the world. I think it is totally correct. Besides, Japanese are very careful about being on time. They almost do with everything on time, and seldom have it delayed without apology. I think the manners are so brilliant a habit that we should learn more from them.   I realized that I would have changed a lot when I came back from Japan. I felt like getting more mature and independent than before. I started to cook for my family and took care of them. My parents were both so glad to see my change.  And what is the most important is that I became a much hard-working student than I went to Japan before. I want to visit Japan again."
