        "Summarize the following story in first person: I'm feeling so disappointed in myself this last week. I had been putting it off for awhile, but I finally decided to bite the bullet and just drop out of college. For the last year I've felt bogged down with anxiety and it's getting worse and worse. I didn't want to let anyone down or waste my efforts so far and so I tried really hard to push through it. Unfortunately, it's just been too hard lately and I couldn't take it anymore. I actually literally left in the middle of a class because I was feeling so overwhelmed. At that point I was just done. I made an appointment with my counselor later that afternoon, and I let them know I wanted to drop out. I feel so stupid, though, because I have all of this debt now and it's for no reason! It doesn't seem fair that I didn't finish but still have to pay in full. I will try to look into it and see if I have any options, but I feel totally hopeless. It's a joke, to me, that our system works like this. Right now I just feel like such a failure, I want to curl up and do nothing. I hope I can start to feel better soon. This is really making me think that it's time to get in to see a doctor about this anxiety, because it is ruining my life."
