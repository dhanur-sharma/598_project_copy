        "Summarize the following story in first person: This all started about 3 months ago on the dot from this date. My wife and I were finally moving out of the apartment we shared for over 7 years and were ready to make a change. We had an extremely small place we were going to move into on some families lot just to hold us over. We planned on living there for a bit, saving a bunch of money, and doing other things like travel and a search for long term housing options in the meantime. Well, the option on the families lot fell through with less than a month to move out from our apartment. The next day, a young woman who had recently moved into our complex was having a party outside. 1 of her male friends came to visit and partake in the party. He offered my wife and I a place to park a travel trailer on his lot, for incredibly cheap and also have access to a house. This is where everything started to go downhill. My wife started to disappear, sometimes for 2 days at a time during the move out process, leaving me feeling responsible for it all. So, it's the end of April, our lease is up April 31st, and we're finally moving out after purchasing a travel trailer. We end up on the lot, it's in a very seedy neighborhood, but it's nice enough. We have full access to a home, our trailer, and now a yard. I slowly but surely start to see my wife starting to form an emotional affair right before my eyes with the male roommate. We were in a bit of a rough patch, but nothing unworkable in my eyes. She's still disappearing with him in his car, sleeping away from me, becoming extremely distant, indifferent, and all around completely out of her character. To cut the story short as it honestly is deeply upsetting me, June 2nd rolls around and as she's getting out of the shower after avoiding me like a plague, she tells me she no longer wants to try in our relationship. 8.5 years treated like a tissue that can just be thrown away. The betrayal I have felt since then has been unimaginable. Our court date is set for dissolution and my heart hurts every second of every day."
