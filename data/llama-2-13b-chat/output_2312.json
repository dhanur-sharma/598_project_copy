        "Summarize the following story in first person: My journey to get my cpa license is quite a bit different than many other active license cpa.  After I got my degree in accounting which is my second university degree as I also have a economic degree before that.  I decide it was time to get a full time job, which I did. I got the first job I apply for at the university where I got my college education. However, during this time, I find out more what a cpa license is and decide to study for it to get the gold standard and most sought after license for the profession.  I pass 3 out of four exams during my work there. At this point I found out there is no super visor or anyone above me at that job in that department that has a CPA license that can sign off on my experience verification which is required in the state of Hawaii to obtain the license, which is why most people looking to get this license usually go to accounting firm, especially audit, work their way up for a few years.  Once they get such license, they usually would get promoted and eventually on the fast track to make director and partner after putting in the times of a decade or two.  In my case, I did not get this experience verification.   I passed all four cpa exams in 2012, which are considered one of the hardest professional exams.  Some said it is much harder than the bar exam but who knows, I do know it was pretty hard even for someone who barely had to do any studies in my college year to get good grades on exams.  There is a lot to cover and the exam difficulty is hard as it require almost complete mastery of the material with good understanding to do well.  Luckily for me, a few years after I found out there is an experience verification service by nasba for those who did accounting works but did not have a license cpa above them to sign off on their experiences verification process. During this time, I went over sea for two years as well so the process take a long time, finally when I returned in 2019.  I was able to finish the process and obtain my license."
