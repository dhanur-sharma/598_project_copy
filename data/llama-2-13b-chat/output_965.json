        "Summarize the following story in first person: We have new neighbors, right next door. I've lived here 16 years, not the longest by far in this little area, but established. I own my home. I have planted many flowers, repainted it myself and reroofed a formerly run-down rental. The new neighbors put up a religious sign, from the local hate church. You know, the kind of church that goes to gay pride with signs that say, 'god hates fags,' or picket planned parenthood with fetus photos and angry shouting. The new neighbors' son also practice with weapons on the lawn with his buddies, some kind of asian battle sticks, numchucks, that kind of thing. It's a bunch of white men in their early 20's dressed in black almost every evening, using weapons. I am lesbian and not the only gay on the street. I felt more than a little threatened. Some neighbors stopped by to check in with me and let me know I could come by if I felt unsafe.  Two houses left phone numbers. After the new folks put up their sign from the hate church, new signs started popping up all over the neighborhood. It is a sign based on a US flag with lines of colored print. One line says, 'all are welcome here.' Another line says, \"diversity makes us strong. ' Another says, 'black lives matter.' Basically liberal, loving and inclusive statements and rally cries as befits most residents in this liberal university town. I felt very supported,  as an individual,  as a member of the neighborhood and as a member of a group often targeted for the way we were born.  When the church sign went up, I wasn't sure my neighbors would know the type of church it is- a divisive church, a judgemental church. But they did know, and responded. Now the new neighbors have taken down their sign. But the diversity signs have remained and multiplied. It reminds me of why I have felt so comfortable and welcome here."
