        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last summer I joined a softball team because I like to play, I would like to be in better shape, and I always had fun playing team sports as a kid. Generally it's a good release on the weekends, but this weekend was awful. We were rained out on Saturday, so our double header got pushed to Sunday. Because we then won our double header, we progressed to the finals - which were the same day. We had to play 4 softball games in one day. None of us could believe it. Usually I'd be grateful for good weather, but the heat made all of us lightheaded and grouchy. None of us were as happy as would've or should've been to make it so far in the tournament because we were all so damn hot. We didn't end up winning and we should have all felt really proud of how far we made it, but we were just grateful it was over. I was so exhausted that when I remembered it was Sunday and I had work the next day I was so angry and upset. I wanted to burst into tears. I took up softball as a kind of relaxation or tension relief, and I felt more stressed out than before the weekend started. My body was exhausted and my job is very physical, so the thought of having to expend more energy just made me miserable. I quit playing softball on weekends not long afterwards. It didn't relieve any stress and I was anxious the same kind of thing would happen again. It just wasn't worth the anxiety and effort anymore."
