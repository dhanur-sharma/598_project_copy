        "Summarize the following story in first person: Recently, about a month ago, I went to a comic convention with various members of my family. I had been reading comics since I was a little girl, with my passion being promoted y my family. I had built an impressive collection of comic books, and I loved the environment. I just felt that I belonged, you know? These are my people! I wont ever forget that day, I was excellent. I went to many booths and talked to many creators. I got merchandise signed, I went down artist's alley. I remember just talking to a bunch of different artists about their favorite fandoms. I even got to talk to a few professional comic artists! We didn't go to a particularly large convention, we went a regional one that was more local. However, I felt this increased the closeness of everyone there, and I was happy to see that well known creators came despite it. I enjoyed that day, and I hope to be able to do it again some day! I want to be able to bring my family there again. Anyway, it was very, very, very, very fun!"
