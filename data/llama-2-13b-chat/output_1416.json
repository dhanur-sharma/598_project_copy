        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was tired of living in Southern Illinois. Tired of the cornfields, and the same people, everyday. It was time for a change- a drastic change. The move of a lifetime. I packed my things, took my 2 dogs, and booked it to Florida. The Sunshine State. What a huge difference it was! I knew no one, not a single soul. I had never been there before. Talk about adapting! I got settled in my little 1 bedroom apartment downtown, and took myself for a celebratory drink. Met some people at the bar who I ended up becoming very close with after a few months. Although it got extremely lonely at times, I think I needed this move to help me grow into the woman I am today. It has taught me strength, independence, resilience, and so many other things. I am very thankful for the opportunity to experience something so life-changing and freeing. If I could do it all over again I definitely would. Next stop... California!"
