        "Summarize the following story in first person: During my time as an adolescent I was always getting into trouble. I would get into trouble for things like vandalism and other minor incidents. My parent were tired of me getting in trouble so they decided to do something. They decided to get a mentor for me. They told me he was a middle aged man who was also a troubled teen so he would be able to relate to me. I didn't think I needed help so at first I objected to seeing him. However, I realized all the trouble I was getting into so I decided to give it a shot. When I met him I first didn't think I would like him. However, he knew about all of my interests such as sports and video games so by the end of the day I decided he was cool. The more we met he showed me how to channel how I was feeling that caused me to get into trouble into productive activities like playing sports or drawing. I followed his instructions and I started getting into less trouble. It even got to the point where I completely stopped getting into trouble. He had additional effects on me because he gave me more confidence in myself so I did better at school too. Also, my friends felt safer around me because I wasn't as reckless as before. I would like to keep on meeting with him even forever if he continues to have this effect on me."
