        "Summarize the following story in first person: At the beginning of spring this year, my husband and I made a decision to sell our house. It was the house we closed on the week before we got married -- it's the house we brought our son home from the hospital. We had so many mixed emotions about putting the house on the market. We wanted to move to a different neighborhood, back to the neighborhood we both lived in when we met, so it wasn't a sad occasion but I did not anticipate the bittersweet emotions. I did not realize how strong my emotional ties were to this house. Within the first few days of the house being on the market we got a full-price offer from a fellow, who by all accounts, walked into the house and absolutely fell in love with the place. I was so relieved that we'd found someone who appreciated the house for what it was (modest, no frills, mid-century ranch with a decent finished basement). After we'd gone under contract, we had to scramble to try to find a new place before closing. We knew the general area where we wanted to live but nothing was on the market that checked all the boxes and was within our price range. Then, on Friday afternoon while I was out of town, my realtor called and said she had a house that she thought we'd want to see. I couldn't go but my husband and my son went with her to check it out. It was perfect. They loved it -- they FaceTime'd me while they were walking through it and I loved it. We knew it would move quickly (given the nature of the market and the quality of the house) but I was out of town for the whole weekend and we hadn't taken any steps to secure financing. So that Monday, as soon as the mortgage office opened, we had a call into a mortgage lender who was able to approve us for the loan. Our agent worked out the contract details and submitted our offer only to find out that another full-price offer had been submitted hours earlier. We were crestfallen because we felt certain that, with two identical offers, the owners would choose the one that came in first. But, just our luck, our real estate agent happened to have a mutual friend in common with the owners and, because of this fact alone, the owners decided to accept our offer and we got the house of our dreams!"
