The party definitely went amazing. Plenty of games for the other kids, lots of gifts for the son and lots of fun was had. I took a ton of photos of the party. toward the end of the party my best friend brought out a smash cake. it was so funny watching him tear it up. it looked like he was having lots of fun with it. He was smiling as well as he scooped up pieces of cake to eat. my best friend was also helping him eat the cake. He messed that cake up really good. But when we got to the point where we unwrapped gifts for the son. he acted like he wasn't paying attention to what was going on it was really funny. He kept staring off into the distance. I dont even know what the little guy was staring ."
