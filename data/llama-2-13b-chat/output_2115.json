        "Summarize the following story in first person: Race day was approaching and I had worked so hard over the past 6 months making sure everything was just right.  I changed my diet, was following a strict training schedule that consisted of cardio and strength, and made sure my equipment was in good working order.  I read books on the course and on the transitions through the course.  This was going to be my first adventure race but I felt prepared.  The morning of the race I arrived at the starting line and stationed my equipment at all the aid stops.  I knew exactly where I should be and was ready to time each move.  I knew when to eat, when and how much to drink and what areas to slow down or avoid.  I felt like I was nervous but on top of the world.  The gun shots rang out and the racers started to move.  I followed the crowd into the woods and watched everyone spread out in different directions.  I grabbed my compass and head for the river crossing.  Everything was going great until I reached the climb I had been so worried about.  It took me almost 2 hours to navigate to the top but it was within my sights.  I rested for a moment and dug in the stake as I went to take another step.  Suddenly the rocks shifted and I could feel my hands let go.  Everything went black as I laid motionless on the ground.  When I came to, I was surrounded by people trying to position me on a gurney.  I cried out as the gurney was jolted but my tears were from the pain of not being able to accomplish the goal I worked so hard to reach.  I had devoted so much time and effort and one small mistake was going to take all that away from me.  The doctor looked at the images and said I will heal in time but my dream of finishing that race may not ever become a reality."
