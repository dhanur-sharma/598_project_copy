        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last week I went to get some lunch with my husband and we ran into an old friend at the restaurant we went to. It turned out to be my best friend from college who I haven't seen in 40 years. She told us that she was engaged to my bothers best friend. I screamed because I was so excited and my husband said \"Congrats!\"  So she asked me to be a bridesmaid and I of course said yes! So she showed us the ring and ended up giving us our food for free! Not only was the engagement a surprise but apparently she's the owner of the restaurant too! I couldn't stop, laughing so much good news at once. So my husband and I sat down and got our sandwiches and sides and enjoyed a meal together. Then out of no where he surprised me with plane tickets to Paris next month! What a day! So I cried, again from joy and hugged him. I asked him how he got those tickets because when I looked online it was outrageous-the price that is. He said that our friends were going to go but couldn't because of their job, so he bought them from them for a 60% discount! So needless to say that day was amazing. It was filled with events that I never expected."
