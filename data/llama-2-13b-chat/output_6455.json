        "Summarize the following story in first person: We recently were at a wedding involving two close friends. I was not in the wedding, but my wife was in it. It turns out that I probably should have been in the wedding because I did a lot to make sure that it went well. The groom was a bit nervous beforehand and I took it upon myself to make sure that he kept it together. I made sure that the bridal party had food and drinks while they were getting their pictures taken. I made sure that the bridal dance went well. Nobody knew how it worked, so it was up to me to make sure that people had fun doing it. I also helped a clean up afterwards. It was a little frustrating at times because I basically had to babysit people throughout the night. However, it felt good to be a part of things even though I wasn't in the wedding. People were very appreciative of the things that I did to help. It definitely made for a fun and memorable experience. These were my wife's friends originally, so she was very appreciative of my help as well. This appreciation, coupled with the emotions of the wedding, definitely brought us closer. Add in a little alcohol and we ended up having amazing sex that evening. Suffice it to say that this was a great day that I won't forget anytime soon."
