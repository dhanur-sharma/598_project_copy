I was supposed to be promoted in September of 2019, but instead, I was promoted starting in July of 2019. I was so proud when I heard about my promotion. I have never been promoted in any job before, let alone earlier than normal. It was a normal day when it first happened. I was doing cases, when my supervisor called me into her office. Honestly, I was kind of scared as I didn't know what to expect. I think I thought that maybe I didn't do a case right or my numbers weren't as good as they could have been. Instead, I was greeted by her telling me what a great job I've been doing. She told me that she put in for early promotion for me, and it was approved instantly. I love my job. I also love that I was able to get promoted so early, and I also heard that nobody in a long time has been promoted early like I have. Everyone was proud of me. Even people I don't really talk to that much."
