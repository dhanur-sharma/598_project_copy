        "Summarize the following story in first person: Working with Mike has always been great, and it was unfortunate that he had to move. It was obviously a great opportunity for him. I only wish he had told me how she felt about me before he was already out the door. I had just gotten into work and was walking towards Mike when he blocked my path. He confessed to me that he always had feelings for me, but felt he was unable to act on it since we worked together. He went on about how he thought we could have something. The thing is, I also like Mike, and withheld this for the same reason. I think due to the timing of this all, we both knew nothing could come of it. He was moving all the way to Washington to co-lead the new branch. Maybe one day he'll move back. Maybe I'll move there. Who knows. For the time being we're gonna stay in touch. I don't think anything will come of this though. It is simply too much distance. Oh well. Next time I'll be sure to say something."
