        "Summarize the following story in first person: I remember this one day back in high school. I had just finished my last year of school, in a brand new area since my father had us move for work. I was really sad about a friend I had, because she said she was moving away the day that school ended. I was so distraught I couldn't bring myself to say anything to her, since it was too painful for me to remember how I would never see her again. I ended up bolting out of my last class and heading to the local market, where I bought a maple bar and coffee. Maple bars and coffee ended up being a ritual of sorts for me after that day. I bought a 20 dollar store card at that same market and redeemed it for a video game, which I played for an hour before breaking down in tears. I wished at the time things were different, that I didn't have her leave my life. I was certain, at least at the time, that I had met someone very special to me. Fast forward a couple of years, and I no longer speak to her. Part of me wishes that I kept in touch, but I realize now that people have to move one. No matter how painful or uncomfortable it may be. I still drink coffee and eat donuts from time to time, but I've stopped for the most part. I try to be healthier, even if it seems like it is an effort that goes unnoticed. I wish her the best."
