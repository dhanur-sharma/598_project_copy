        "Summarize the following story in first person: It's been a really tough past few years, specifically with the pain I've had from these headaches. Every doctor gave me a different story. Well, I say 'every' but I know I've only been to two others, I guess I just started to feel like I wasn't getting anywhere. you go see a doctor and then get a prescription, take medications, give it a try and hope things work out. There's no guarantees. And honestly, it just started to feel like it was about being boxed into any kind of box that allowed them prescribed medication they were enticed to sell. Anyway, meeting her was awesome, immediately we got down to the facts, I have these headaches. They come and are debilitating, but migraine medication doesn't work. It starts out in my neck, goes into my head and just sits there for days on end. She asked about how I spent my days, how I spend a lot of time working at the computer. She asked about my eyes, wearing glasses, all of that. She just seemed to know exactly how to get where she was going. And I even admitted to her how I just didn't believe anything would work out. She pulled up some information on the computer and explained how my headaches were probably related to my eyes. And that back pain was causing neck pain and so on. I couldn't believe what she knew about this given she was a general practitioner not a specialist. Just like that, she said it wasn't migraines and previous treatments were all wrong, and missteps for my treatment. So fast forward a couple weeks, a visit to the optometrist and now I haven't had a headache or stuffy head or pain in my neck since these visits. I am so thrilled and happy. I called her office to say thanks and they took time to talk to me and see how I was doing. Just a great experience all in all. So yeah, I am thrilled."
