        "Summarize the following story in first person: On July 4, 2019, we had a picnic at our new church property.  The property is located in a wooded area and encompasses about 15 acres.  It was a wonderful day full of food, games, and fun. The barbecue chicken was delicious.  The children played, and laughed.  Everyone, children and adults alike, participated in a water balloon fight. It really was a nearly perfect day.       Near the end of the day, the adults were  relaxing in lawn chairs while the children were playing kickball.  Suddenly, one of the others started screaming and calling everyone's attention to a wooded corner of the open field.  An enormous black bear had emerged from the tree line, and seemed to be watching the children play their game.  It was the biggest black bear I had ever seen.  I ran out to the field to gather the children.     After a few moments, the bear continued on its way through the corner of the field and into the woods  next to our property.  Everyone was excited to have seen such a sight.  However, the experience was a bit startling as well.  It made all of us consider the reality that we share our land with a vast array of wildlife."
