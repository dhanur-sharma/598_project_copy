I looked at it and read all of the information ans was very excited to apply. i went ahead and applied. I had a good feeling and was sure that they would call me. i waited a few days and nothing happened. then as soon as i was thinking that they wouldn't call, they did. the call went very well and i was asked to come in for an interview. I went in for the interview and everything went very well. the person interviewing was nice, i felt right at home. we exchanged thought and I answered questions. we shook hands and I left. I was sure i would get the job. they never called me to offer a job. It made me sad. i feel like i messed up somehow, but i do not know what i did."
