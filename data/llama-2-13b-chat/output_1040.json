        "Summarize the following story in first person: My brother's wife found out she was pregnant last summer.  We were all very excited to get to have a new member of the family.  We all doted on her and would buy the baby things every time we were out shopping.  When she found out she was having a girl, we got even more excited.  A month ago, her water broke so we all knew the time had come.  She was going to have this baby and we were all going to get to meet her!  We all went to the hospital and waited and waited and waited.  Thankfully, my sister in law didn't have any complications.  Since it was her first baby, though, things progressed really slowly.  The day turned into night and then in the early morning hours, she gave birth!  We couldn't wait to get a chance to see the baby.  We got to see her after she got all checked out.  The nurse wheeled her out to us.  She was so precious!  Then, later on the next day, I finally got to hold her.  She smelled really good and even held my finger in her little hand.  It was a moment I will never forget.  Every chance I can get, I visit them and see how great of parents they are.  The baby is still just as amazing as she was the first day I saw her."
