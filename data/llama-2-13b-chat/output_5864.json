        "Summarize the following story in first person: I went to the movies to see Detective Pikachu.  I went to the theater just up the street. I went with my boyfriend. It had been about 7 years since I had been to see any movie in a theater because I'm not a huge movie fan in general and I don't like the theater experience.  This was an important event for me because my boyfriend suggested it on his own and it was something special we could share. I have been a fan of Pokemon since the beginning, but for many years I had no one to share it with.  I thought about how when the first Pokemon movie came out almost 20 years ago I had no one to go see it with, and finally having someone to share Pokemon with made me feel so happy and special. The best, most memorable part was when Pikachu got sad and serious in the movie and my boyfriend leaned over to hug and kiss me.  It was a special moment. Also, I hadn't been in a theater in so long I hadn't realized how much they have improved, with the recliners and the assigned seating.  It was so much more comfortable and less cramped.  It was also awesome going to a weekday matinee when almost no one else was there.  It completely changed my view of movie watching.  This reminds me of another top moment.  When we were selecting our assigned seats I found out my boyfriend also likes the front row just like I do.  Most people don't like the front roe in movies.  Having that in common was really cool."
