        "Summarize the following story in first person: I recently went to Denver with my boyfriend. This was the third time in three years that we've made this trip. We go there to watch hockey games, to hang out with our friends that have moved there, and to drink craft beer, as this is a hobby of ours. I am the planner, and am comfortable planning things for us because my boyfriend doesn't care about what we do one way or another. This year I let him know I was planning for us to visit a total 19 different breweries and worked out when could do each thing I wanted. One of the things we had to figure out when we would be hitting up all the breweries I wanted to visit in Boulder. We had to plan this carefully because some days were just out of the question - there were two days we needed to be in Denver for because we would be attending hockey games, and we wanted to be in Denver on the last day we were leaving instead of going to the airport from Boulder. In the end, everything worked out. We went to Boulder the day we got into town. We got to see his friend that moved up there. I got to spend some one-on-one time at brunch with my friend while my boyfriend slept in at the hotel. We got to see hockey games. We visited a cat cafe on our final day in town and brought them some toys that I had ordered and shipped to an Amazon Locker. My boyfriend got some advice from brewers, as he was seeking to brew his own beer. We even got to visit some places that weren't on the list because I didn't schedule any restaurants for us to visit while we were there. Every day was rewarding because we had an itinerary, a purpose for visiting each brewery, and because I focused on location and hours of operation of each of those places and planned accordingly. The only thing we didn't get to do - again - was visit the Denver Mint. He had been wanting to go since the first year we went. Maybe next year."
