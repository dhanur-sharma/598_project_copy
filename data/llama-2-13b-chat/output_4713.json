        "Summarize the following story in first person: So, I went to Las Vegas this March. I go down to Vegas a lot, since I make the majority of my income from playing poker. Unfortunately, my Vegas trips typically turn into more of vacations than work trips like they should be (other than when I actually go specifically to play a tournament). Anyways, like I said, I go a few times a year, at least, but this trip was really quite special. I was down there for two weeks of March Madness, and my Uncle and a few of his work buddies were there for a weekend. I think I've been there at the same time as family members before, but have only really done Vegas with friends, so this was quite cool. It was the first weekend of the tournament, so the place was a zoo. Some of the most memorable moments were watching basketball at the bar by the sports book at Venetian. Another was hanging out at the Wynn's pool during some basketball games and having some beers. We also had a couple of great meals at a steak house at Cosmo and then some Italian place. It was really a lot of fun. I guess what made it so special was seeing my Uncle, who is also my Godfather, with his friends. They are all businessmen or in real estate, and it was cool to see them unwind. I think they go every year. I did get a little too drunk at times, so I kind of regretted that, but overall, I think we had a good time. I can be a bit of a shit show, but I think, if you're going to let loose, Vegas is definitely a place where that is allowed. One of my Uncle's buddies even asked to hit my joint while we were walking down the strip, which I got a kick out of."
