        "Summarize the following story in first person: I am in the habit of buying lottery tickets every time I go to the supermarket. I might win a dollar here and a few dollars there, but as the gamblers like to say, the house always wins. Anyway, about two weeks ago I realized that it had been awhile since I had last checked to see of I had won. There is an app on my iPhone that Can check the tickets quickly with the camera on my phone. When I had some free time I took the tickets off the bulletin board and put them on the table. The first tickets, I scanned where as usual, not winners. Then I scanned the ticket and it said I was a winner of several $1000. I couldn\u2019t believe it. I took it to the place I bought it and check on their machine. Sure enough, it was a winner. I took the train into the city and took it to the lottery office. The man there made sure I signed the ticket first. Then I had to fill out some papers. Several days later, I got money in my bank account. It was the money I won. They took out some money to cover the taxes. Still, it was a nice piece of change. I will use it to catch up on some bills. I will also save some of it. Since I believe each time you have a game of chance the odds reset. I am still going to play the lottery. Maybe I will win again. After all, some people get struck by lightning more than once."
