        "Summarize the following story in first person: I have two good friends that I spent a considerable amount of time with over the last decade or so, Brian and Ashley.  Ashley moved about a year and half ago to Denver, and Brian and I decided to fly out to see him.  It took us a long time to plan the trip and find dates because we all three have families.  As the date for the trip approached, my old roommate's (Pat) mother declined in health.  I remember thinking as she went into hospice that she'd die before I went on the trip.  Well she did pass away about a week before I was scheduled to leave.  I thought maybe just maybe the service would happen before I left.  But it didn't.  I was able to make the visitation.  But I couldn't go to the service.  I anguished over this, but everyone said I should go on the trip.  I was a bit of a wreck.  I really did love Pat's mom.  She'd taken care of us a lot during college.  I probably should've stayed in town."
