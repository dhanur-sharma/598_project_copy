We didn't want to know the sex beforehand. We had been trying for a long time, even too long to remember. It had been blurred in with the times of not knowing and anxiety and wondering what as wrong. I had tried to be positive and I had must of gone through the five stages of grief more times than I care to mention. It wasn't easy imagining such a big change or realizing that the big change might never come. One night however, I remember reading the stick over and over again. My eyes were not lying to me. I was pregnant. I couldn't believe it. All the hard work and emotions had paid off. Best part about it was when she was born. We simply had no idea how much we would love this bundle of joy."
