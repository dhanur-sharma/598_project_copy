        "Summarize the following story in first person: On my morning walk one day a couple of month ago, I tripped and over corrected and snapped my ankle to the point that my foot was facing the wrong way. I honestly thought just from looking at my foot, that I was going to lose it since it was not looking too good at all. I had never broken a bone before, and I was a little shocked that this was happening. I remember as I was falling grabbing my ankle and saying I had broken it. It was surreal, I just couldn't believe this was happening to me.  I had to have surgery to fix my ankle since it couldn't really be snapped back into place because of how badly it was broken. I had to have two soft casts, then a hard cast and that is when the hard part started. Once I got the hard cast in place, I was given a walking boot so I can start learning how to walk again. It was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do. I never really thought about walking, it was just something I did. But relearning how to walk was brutal. I really did not think I had it in me to do it. I was in pain since I was still healing, terrified that I was going to break my other ankle and fall and just angry that this happened to me. I had to deal with all of those emotions on top of learning to do something that babies do and make look so easy. I hated, but I knew it was something that needed to be done. It took months, and I still walk with a limp sometimes, but I did it and I faced one of the worst things that has happened to me."
