        "Summarize the following story in first person: My family and I work with a charity to deliver food to the homeless one weekend a month. One Saturday a few months ago, our truck run was scheduled for the day before Easter. I wanted to do something special for the homeless. I made a few suggestions to my family. My moody teenager daughter soundly rejected each idea and then went upstairs. She didn't return downstairs. I assumed she just didn't want to do anything. A little while later though, she came downstairs with an idea. She suggested we fill plastic eggs with chocolates and deliver them with food to the homeless. So I went out and bought the supplies. My family and I all filled the eggs with candy. On Saturday, my daughter watched as the homeless individual's opened their plastic eggs. I remember that she became teary eyed as she saw the delight on the homeless people's faces as they found the chocolates. She didn't want us to see, but we did. I was very proud of her."
