        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was 4 months ago, i had my second house get together. It was a game night and i invited friends and family that were my age and a little older. I didn't know what to expect or how they would react, however. The night came and it was a blast. we had so much laughs and fun being together everyone wanted to know when would be the next one.  I felt so happy to have shared that time with my family and friends, when they left i genuinely missed them and could not wait to see them again. it had everything you you would love in a party, food, family, friends and fun. Now that its been so long I'm definitely getting ready to do another with hopes of it turning out even better. For this to turn out the way it did, it did take quiet a bit of planning. I had sent out invitations a month in advance, and the same time i chose the games i wanted to play as well as what we would eat at the party. I decided on us playing a card game with a twist and for food I had pizza, patties, an array of drinks as well as cake. The first person that arrived got a prize. And as we waited for everyone to get there, we sat talked and watch a movie. Everyone showed up somewhat on time and that is when the games began. We ended up playing and laughing it up for a good 3 hours."
