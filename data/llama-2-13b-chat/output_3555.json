        "Summarize the following story in first person: This is the predicament I find myself into today. I'm 50 years old I have health issues and a house and a mortgage that I can't afford any more.  This was a job that I've held since I was 18 years old in a career that spanned over 30 years.  I wish I could say I saw it coming. To me personally, yes, but not for the entire staff- no!  We helped build this company for decades and to lose it over one contract is just unbelievable but that's the way the business was heading.  We did not diversify our portfolio enough and dependent on one contract basically to keep this place afloat.  It was not a lucrative contract by any means because the competition is very fierce and we could not perform and offer the things that were making other offers attractive.  It was a lot of discussion about cuts and how we could continue to move forward as a company without making some pretty severe adjustments.  However I don't believe I could really see our doors closing forever.  For me personally, it is going to be a very difficult time in my life.  I do not have the means or resources and I haven't saved enough money. I have gone through my 401k another for other reasons mostly.  Health issues and what not have put me in a rather precarious position.  But I'm not like any other people are going to feel this severe impact of losing their incomes.  Hopefully, my friends and the people that I get along with are going to be okay it's but it's going to be painful. For many others I suspect it will be devastating and they will need to figure out a way to recover maybe in an unconventional ways."
