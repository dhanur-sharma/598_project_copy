        "Summarize the following story in first person: The event was at a Carolina N/T race in Piedmont,NC. I was there shooting the event for the series and for my media page for the weekend. I happened to be in the right place at the right time and was able to record 2 passes that involved a huge save. One being a car that got completely sideways, while the other video was 2 cars that almost hit each other. Both drivers are ok. After both incidents happened I knew I had gold. Once the event was over, I drove back home and uploaded the videos on Facebook as fast as I could to beat the rush of videographers that might have also got it too. These 2 videos after editing and uploading them the next day had a combine total of 12k views on facebook in 2 days. It blow my mind how fast they they gained traction and grabbed views like that. This was my first pair of videos that have reached over 3k views so  I was ecstatic.  This rose my confidence up big time. I also felt that my hard work was beginning to pay off. From the result of that video i went from 400 to 503 followers in a week. It has also gotten me noticed by other promoters. Since then i've been able to go to more races based of that notoriety. yup."
