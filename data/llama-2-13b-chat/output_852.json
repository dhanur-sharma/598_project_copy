        "Summarize the following story in first person: Recently my wife and I got roped into going to the Oregon state fair y a few friends. usually when we run into these people all they ever want to do is go get trashed. however, we had been trying to distance ourselves from that kind of influence these days. then when we went to meet up with those friends they instead told us that they had been planning to go to the fair for sometime and would love us to join. we all went together and had an amazing time. it was the first time any of us had ridden a roller coaster in years and I doubt you have ever seen a group of full grown well paid adults scream louder. we later ended up going to the beach boys show there at the fair grounds which was absolutely horrid, like so bad, so to recover the mood of the night we spent the rest of the daylight playing carnival games. which also lead to the classic scene in every carnival or fair scene where i got to shoot darts well enough to win my love a large stuffed unicorn. while this was the definition of carnival cheesy, I could tell we both genuinely enjoyed it. after we all gathered again with our friends we returned home and decided to go sing karaoke at a favorite bar of our friends. while I said that we usually do not like to drink this is a bar we go to often near our home and this was also the first time we actually sat and talked with any of the bar staff. you know the way service staff will only talk to you after you have been around for a while and tipped even better. later one of the bar tenders pulled me aside to tell me that my wife and I are some of their favorite customers and told me that we brought an amazing atmosphere with us when we came to sing and encouraged others to have fun and do the same. this was especially touching since we always sorta of felt like this staff preferred out friends over us. they knew them much better and our friends are amazing but they are also much more outspoken so to be pulled aside and told this was honestly really heart warming."
