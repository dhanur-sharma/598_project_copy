        "Summarize the following story in first person: A click in my mind and all goes spiraling again. I never forget the important things to me, but to let go means let in more negative things. I think that I'm stalled out in life, and not stuck and most likely why i had a crazy situation growing up. I keep pressing through life and hope something will change and most of us go through this at some point or over and over again. I hope to grow old quicker just to give god the finger, begging for truth. Lonely but not miserable, you don't see my simple needs, you don't see my raising. Could be due to my negative background but you still pop up in my mind, and no, i don't wanna chase you. I begged for change and i got it, but what all triggered these events? Lost love and confusion and cock blocked. I hate saying oh well, but all i can do is hope for the better. Changing what i do, pray that i die, hope to grow old and forget, keep what i remember and hope things move on. You hope at death, you'll forget, but you ask for a life that you know will have hardships. I do come to my own understanding that I'm not in my rightful place or surroundings, i belong traveling or around high energy people but i also have things holding me back from doing other things that i might enjoy. I take god into account and i also take life and something around it, but I'm ready to continue on but who knows. I get masked cause the body doesn't want to be in a draining depression all the time that i can't really help. Just free writing and experiencing anxieties,"
