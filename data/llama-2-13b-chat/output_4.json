I had a lot of fun and met some friends. But now after it is done I'm having financial problems. My bills keep coming and I owe people. Including my new friends. Everyday bills come and new bills come in the mail. I always look at the caller ID now on my phone, just in case. if I owe them money I don't want to answer. Everyday it feels like I made a mistake by letting myself spend all my money. I have to work extra hours but they won't give me any. So the bills just keep piling up and I need to search around for a second job. I barely have enough time for the first one. I really should have thought about what would have happened in advance."
