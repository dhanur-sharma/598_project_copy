        "Summarize the following story in first person: This was an anniversary trip to the Bahamas with my wife.  We were celebrating 15 years of marriage.  We actually ended up going with another couple who are very good friends of ours and it really made the trip great.  We spend several days there and the weather was outstanding, and allowed for snorkeling, and lounging by the pool and beach.  We really enjoyed the private island that the resort offered.  The food was decent and the drinks flowed and it allowed us to relax.  My wife and I had some much needed time by ourselves without having to worry about the kids.  One of the funniest things that happened was the morning we were leaving, my wife had some allergic reaction to something, and her lips swelled up like she got Botox!  It was funny. The swelling went away fairly quickly, so it was easy to laugh about it.  Another funny thing was the dance party that took place at the main pool.  There were some very intoxicated people up there shaking what they had and having fun.  We laughed and laughed as we LOVE people watching.  The most important thing was that my wife and I got to focus on each other and we both felt like it strengthened our marriage even more than it already was.  I really encourage all married couples (especially parents) to get away here and there, even if it is for a night or a weekend.  We realized that adulting is difficult and you need to take time for yourselves and your relationship to cherish all the things you love about it and remember why you got together in the first place.  We are already planning our next get away together to continue to keep our relationship fresh and exciting."
