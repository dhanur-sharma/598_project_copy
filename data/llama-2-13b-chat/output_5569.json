        "Summarize the following story in first person: I recently gave birth to a baby daughter. This was a personal miracle for me because my daughter had presented problems during my pregnancy. In fact, my pregnancy was quite difficult. I wished, throughout my pregnancy, that my grandmother were here. I wanted to talk to her and get advice and comfort from her. Unfortunately, she had already passed away. I loved her very much - she was like a mother to me. Throughout my pregnancy, I continued to speak with her in my mind, convinced she could hear me. Afterward, I would feel much better. When it was time for my baby to be born, I was so excited but scared. In the end, I delivered and looked at my baby girl: I was surprised to see that she had my grandmother's eyes. I knew then, without a shadow of a doubt, that my grandmother was with me. She was a part of my daughter. This was significant to me because I knew that I would always have her with me, her watching over me and me watching over her. It was a very special moment for me."
