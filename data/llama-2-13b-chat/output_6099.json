        "Summarize the following story in first person: About a month ago my husband I traveled to Washington D.C. We had my best friend with me and were dropping him off at the airport near D.C. We left early so we could walk around D.C and enjoy the sights. Little did we know how long the metro ride was from where we were going to which was near the Airport to all the sights of D.C. It was a half hour away. We had been driving all day and were ready to park. The first parking garage we pulled into wanted to charge us $20 to park. We had only planned to be in the city for a few hours and not all day. So we ended up leaving that parking garage and found another one. The funny thing about this parking garage is that is was so huge we literally got lost in the parking garage for about 20 minutes. At first it was frustrating, then it became maddening, and then it was just hilarious. You think of all things to lost in, the last would be a parking garage. Eventually, we found a parking spot. Way at the bottom of the parking garage. I can easily say it will be a long time before we venture back out to D.C."
