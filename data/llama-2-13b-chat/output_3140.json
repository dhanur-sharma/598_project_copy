        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was diagnosed with Thyroid cancer 4 months ago. Prior to that, I noticed a lump in my neck that was getting  bigger. My neck was in constant pain, I was having trouble swallowing, and was just in constant discomfort. I didn't even think about thyroid cancer, because I didn't even know about it at the time. When you hear about cancer, thyroid cancer isn't really hear about often. So, I went to the doctor to see what was going on, and a week later, I get told that I need to have a thyroidectomy. I was in shock. Luckily, the doctor said it was caught early and hadn't spread anywhere else int he body. 2 days later, I was in getting ready to go to the hospital, when I tripped on the curb and fractured my wrist. Good thing I was going to the hospital! They said this wouldn't complicate things, luckily. I just had to have it wrapped up. Afterwards, about 2 weeks later, I had a complication of a seroma on my neck. I didn't know what this meant would happen next. I had to go in once again, and they took care of it. It wasn't as scary as I thought it would be. That month was just hectic, but luckily I am in good health now."
