        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was grocery shopping by myself, which is pretty rare. I normally take my child everywhere with me, but this particular day, he stayed home with my husband. I was going down the aisles and I heard a child crying. I thought for a second that it was mine before I remembered I was alone. The cries were getting closer as I was going down the aisles. I finally came across them and saw a young mother desperately trying to calm her crying baby and pushing a cart with the other hand. She looked frazzled and had tears in her eyes. I've been there plenty of times. I went over and explained that I'm a mother too and I know how this feels, and if she was okay with it, I can hold her baby while she finishes shopping. I could tell she was hesitant, I mean, who wouldn't be? But she agreed, and allowed me to hold her baby while she finished up shopping. It's something that would have meant a lot to me back when my kid was that young. By the time she was done, her baby was asleep, and she was relieved and happy. I was happy I could help another mom. Even though I was shopping alone, I still ended up with a baby in my arms."
