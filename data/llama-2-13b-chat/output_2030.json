        "Summarize the following story in first person: This event was a new patient doctor's appointment.  I was expecting the worst but was pleasantly surprised by my experience!  I walked into the office, already shaking. I was scared and armed with my folder of medical information. I have two rare conditions, EDS and Dysautonomia. I didn't think she would take me seriously. When she walked in, I was immediately put to ease. It felt like I had known her for a while. She had already gone through my medical information and told me that she believed me. She told me I had likely been mistreated and misdiagnosed before. She told me she wanted to help me and that we would make a plan together. My biggest surprise was that she believed me. I was ready to give up on the medical stuff. She doesn't know it but she saved me in a way.  This meant the world to me. Since then I have been set up with multiple specialists who are actually interested in helping me, too. They believe me, too."
