        "Summarize the following story in first person: This past Spring, my Grandma took a turn for the worse in the nursing home she was in.  I had been visiting her throughout the year, in various nursing homes and witness her mental state decline, which was a result from the multiple strokes and dementia she had.  It was very hard to see her like this because she had always been a pretty level headed woman and she was not talking nonsense most of the time, she did know who I was, however, and usually had a big smile on her face when she saw me. This past Spring, I had received a call from my cousin that I might want to go visit her that day because she seemed to be declining quickly. It was a Sunday afternoon, my baby was napping and we were all being a bit lazy, but I got ready and drove down to the nursing home about 25 minutes away. When I got there, she seemed alert and awake and she knew who I was. She was so skinny because she hadn't eaten in a long time. I noticed she was having problems swallowing whatever was in her mouth and she was very thirsty. I would give her some water and she would try to spit out whatever was getting stuck in her throat because she really couldn't swallow anymore. She kept asking for more water which I helped her with and I kept wiping her mouth to try and get her throat and mouth clear of the gunk. I stayed for almost 2 hours and had to leave. One thing that will always stick out in my mind about that visit was, even though she was going through all this, she had enough energy to lift up my hand and give it a kiss, I know that moment will always stick in my mind. Later that night, I received another call from my cousin saying I really should go down there again because her oxygen wasn't good and she could go at anytime. I drove back down to the nursing home and when I walked in the room, my family was there, their eyes all wet and red from crying. I looked over at my Grandma and she was no longer aware, she wasn't in a coma but she was looking up, with an oxygen mask on, taking deep breaths. My family and I stayed for a long time, talking, telling stories and laughing because my family likes to laugh in times like these but we were all a mess seeing her like this. Finally, my cousin and I noticed that her pulse was no longer reading on the machine and we called in a nurse right away. Luckily, there was a Priest who came about that same time and gave her, her last rites and she was pronounced dead. There is one image of my Grandma that will always be in my mind, and that is when the nurse, finally took off her oxygen mask after she passed. I hadn't realized how she looked until he took off that mask, she looked so malnourished and skeletal like that it was kind of shocking and surprising when they took it off her."
