        "Summarize the following story in first person: The most recent memorable experience I had is when I got a promotion. Before I got my promotion I was an assistant manager. Now I have been promoted to store manager of my own store. When I first had gotten called into the office to speak with my boss I was wary if I was in trouble or not. But then a relief set in as I realized that I was being praised for my work and not reprimanded. This was such a great feeling to be praised about my work and about my work ethic and to be recognized for excelling at my work. I was so excited. I am only 28 years old and to be promoted to manager of my own store was so exciting for me. I am the first one in my family to be making above 45k a year. I feel so accomplished. This has definitely been the most exciting time in my life for me for as far as I can remember. This promotion will encourage me to further my career within this company and to see how much more growth is possible within it. I am so glad for this opportunity. I look forward to even more growth. I have never been so happy."
