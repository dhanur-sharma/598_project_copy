This is something i've been wanting to do for the past several years but I never had the guts to do it.  I finally realized that I need to go ahead and follow my dreams and achieve this goal.  I did tons of research.  I listen to to ther podcasts every day.  I study the great football podcasters.  When it was time to do my own podcast, I knew exactly what to do.  I knew my first post had to be exciting.  I made it about one of my favorite quarterbacks.  The podcast ended up getting a lot of views.  Many people commented on it.  Even professionals commented on it.  I did a great job.  I will keep doing my podcast.  I'll keep getting better."
