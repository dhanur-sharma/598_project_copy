        "Summarize the following story in first person: My mom, daughter, and I were visiting my sister, her husband, and my nephew in Colorado. I don't remember where my sister and her husband went, but the rest of us were watching my nephew. He has a nap time routine that my sister always does with him. It was nap time, and I was out on the front porch talking to my husband on the phone, and my mom was carrying my nephew up the stairs, which are right across from the front door. He told my mom that he doesn't want her to put him down for a nap, and that he wants me to do it. She came and told me, and I quickly got off the phone to do it. I was so happy that he chose me. We don't get to see him super often like we would if he lived in the same city as us, and my mom is a baby hog, so the fact that he chose me really meant a lot to me. I took him up to his room and we sat in his rocking chair. I gave him his milk. I read him a few books, then we just cuddled for a few minutes. I laid him down in his crib and covered him with his blanket. I turned on his sound machine and his night light thing. He's a really good napper, so he didn't fight me at all. He isn't super cuddly or lovey, so this meant a lot to me."
