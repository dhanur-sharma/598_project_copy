        "Summarize the following story in first person: Around six months ago, on my birthday, my friends surprised me by taking me on a trip to Philadelphia. This on its own is already a sweet thing for friends to do, but for me it was especially great. I've never liked celebrating my birthday, as on the years I have celebrated my birthday, bad things have happened that day. As a result, I've built up a kind of superstition around my birthday, and usually avoid going out. I'd told my friends that this year, as per usual, I planned on having a nice quiet day, go to the gym, treat myself to some nice food, maybe take the time to make a fun cocktail for myself or buy some expensive beer. They said it was fine, but they wanted to take my out to brunch, so I acquiesced, because I knew that they saw my simple birthdays as a sad thing, despite that not being my attitude towards them. I mostly agreed for their sake, so they wouldn't be worried about me. When I left the apartment that day, I thought we'd just be getting lunch and I'd have my quiet day. Instead, one of my friends was waiting outside with a rental car. They gave me a card and told me to go back in and pack a weekend's worth of clothes. I was floored, and obviously I went back inside to pack. I felt bad they were spending so much money on me when I knew I'd never be able to do the same for them, but since everything had already been paid for, I couldn't let it go to waste. To be entirely honest, there was a small part of me that wishes they hadn't done it, because it was the exact opposite of what I asked them to do: every year I ask to not receive gifts, partly because I myself am bad at giving gifts, and partly because I know I can't afford to give the kinds of gifts they can, and would feel bad about it. This, of course, was larger than any git I'd ever received, and larger than I could ever give, and to a certain degree, inside, it bothered me. But, I knew my friends weren't looking for repayment, and they were doing it out of kindness and a genuine care for me, so I shelved my pride and let myself have fun. We went to Philly and stayed at a hotel, swam in the pool, ate awesome food, and generally lazed around for the weekend, exploring the city and seeing the sights. I got to climb the stairs of the Philly Art Museum (like in one of my favorite movies, Rocky), I got to visit Reading Terminal, and we had amazing cheesecake. All in all, it was the best birthday I'd ever had, and I'm glad I got to spend it with my friends."
