        "Summarize the following story in first person: Back on July 2, 2019, I took both of my dogs outside to go for their nightly \"potty\". I noticed Buddy was acting a little slow but as she was almost 16 I expected this. I could see both of them outside chasing each other.  All of a sudden Buddy sat down and kept looking around. A few minutes later she got up, turned and looked at my mom before running off into the dark.  I could hear her breathing and Sparky was barking. We kept waiting for them but we they never came back. We ended up going outside and shining a flashlight. That is when we saw her laying on her side with Sparky standing by her crying. I could see that one of her ears was up like she had been listening to us. It was so strange how she went and laid in her favorite spot and died. This is a place she always seemed to love. There was a rare cool breeze that night and I could see her ear moving. I couldn't believe it. I picked her up and carried her over to the patio. I'll never forget how limp her body was and how sad I felt. I never have been able to fully get past it. I miss her so much. I often find that I relive that night when I go outside. Recently I went out there and stood for a minute. I have really had to fight depression. Our other little dog was sad for a long time but he seems to be finally getting better. We are still in the process of getting another dog and we keep putting it off. I guess because we can't replace her and it is still hard to imagine bringing in a new dog. I do know that my other dog would love to have a companion."
