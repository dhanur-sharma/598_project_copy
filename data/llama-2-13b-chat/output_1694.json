        "Summarize the following story in first person: Three months ago was the annual family vacation. This year we decided to be a little more adventurous and spend a week in Yellowstone National Park. My wife and I had started to be more physically active in an attempt to be have a healthier lifestyle. We had always wanted to go camping together, but haven't had the time. Our wedding registry actually consisted of mostly camping and outdoor gear, and now we have a chance to use it. After arriving at the park, we scouted out a nice area to setup camp near Lamar Valley. This area was chosen primarily because of reviews about the hiking trail. After two nights of eating hot dogs cooked on a campfire, we decided we would go hiking in the morning. We packed our backpacks with some trail mix, beef jerky and some extra water. After a big breakfast we began our journey of the hike. The scenery was incredible! We took a lot of pictures of the view with my wife and I posing for selfies and silly poses. While I was taking a picture of my wife up against a tree, I saw a figure move behind the tree. I put up a finger to shush my wife and motioned for her to creep towards me. She turns around and sees a bear 15 feet from her and screams! I began to roar at the bear and make very loud noises trying to scare it away. Amazingly enough, the bear ran away back into the woods and we raced back to our camp. We escaped with no physical harm done, although it was mentally jarring and nerve wrecking. The rest of the camping trick was spent at our campsite as we were too scared to continue hiking. The trip was overall enjoyable and we had a good time."
