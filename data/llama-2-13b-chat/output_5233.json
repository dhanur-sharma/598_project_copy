        "Summarize the following story in first person: Recently I started DM'ing for a group of friends  for Dungeons and Dragons. They are a group mostly put together by my roommate, but I am friends with them also, and love playing games enough to make it work with anyone! We drew their character sheets up, and started our adventure a few months back. The first 'episode' involved all of the characters meeting in a pub. I was worried about how to make this flow naturally, but luckily my close friend quickly caused a disturbance with one of the local patrons, and a fight broke out as he tried to swindle money from this dude. The whole group got involved in a bar fight/chase sequence, ending in a mystery involving some cultist that they solved.  I was surprised how creatively people both created and solved the problems that this group storytelling made occur. We played a few more sessions over the next few weeks, but have been unable to find a time to meet in a couple months. This is a bummer, because I plan out sessions a little in advance, but all of my efforts feel wasted when plans fall through. What more, a couple was playing as two of the characters, and the one I was more friends with both moved away from my city and broke up with the other one. Now when we play, we'll be without one of the most creative members as well as one of my better friends. I'm worried about the future for the campaign, and would almost rather start from scratch with a new group. I now have even better friends that I enjoy spending time with, and I feel like it would be easier to meet up with them more regularly. That said, I made a sort of commitment  to my first group. While I'm confused now, I know once I start playing again with either group, I'll enjoy myself again. It just stinks that an outlet that I quickly came to enjoy so much ended up being so difficult to make work for so many people."
