        "Summarize the following story in first person: This is a story about us winning the local baseball tournament for adults of a recreational league. The morning before the championship game I remember I had woken up with blisters on each of my big toes. I couldn't even walk and as a catcher we have to put support and all our body weight on our toes the whole game so this was not going to go well. I rushed to the store to see if they had anything and they ended up having a sort of blister remover. This blister remove worked wonders but I could still feel pain when putting weight on the toes affected. A friend and teammate of mine recommended that I spray the stuff soccer players spray on their ankles to fight through pain. One of the umpires for the game had some cans in his car because his son played soccer and would complain of pain after every game. I sprayed some of the stuff on my toes and was able to fight through the pain for the game. It was like some anesthetic type spray but spray version of it. I liked it overall and it made the most sense. It was practical and really helped me in the long run. We ended up winning the game because of me being able to play. I feel like I am good at giving signs to the pitcher when I am the catcher. We had won the title and I was real proud of that. We had finally made turned failure into success."
