        "Summarize the following story in first person: A few weeks ago I went to visit my elderly father. He's a terrific man, but has a way about him that is a little intimidating. He's always been in control of everything around him. As I was growing up, I saw him as Superman. The years have taken their toll and he is now in his late 80s and having problems with his health and his memory. It's hard to see Superman become human. During my visit, I stayed with him at the retirement home and we had wonderful conversations about life, family, what we think happens to us after this life, etc. I felt so honored that he was confiding in me some of his most personal thoughts and fears. I felt closer to him than I ever had before. We talked about how much he missed my mother who passed away a few years ago. We talked about how he hopes to be remembered. We just talked about life in general. Towards the end of the visit, he told me that he had his lawyer draw up papers making me his power of attorney and his healthcare power of attorney. He said I was the only one he trusted to always keep his best interest at heart. I'm the youngest of two children, so I assumed my older brother would be the one he would pick for this. I had gone to visit my elderly father, but when I left for home, I was leaving what felt like my best friend and confidant."
