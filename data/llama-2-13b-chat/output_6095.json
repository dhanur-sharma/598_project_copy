        "Summarize the following story in first person: Just a little bit shy of three months ago, I had to put my little dog Ginny down. This was incredibly hard for me because dogs to me are not just dogs, they are treasured family members, it was losing a family member to me. I also just could not believe that this was happening. I took her to the Veterinarian three weeks ago for what I was assuming would be allergies, only for them to tell me that she had lumps that had to be tested. We did a blood test and a biopsy and the results came back as Lymphoma, as rather aggressive form. I took her to a specialized Canine Oncologist, which I did not even know existed, to find out what Ginny's options were. It was disappointing for me to learn that at  best, she had about nine months to live, but if I put her through Chemotherapy, they had a large chance of being good months. I put a lot of thought into it, and ultimately decided that it was worth it to try Chemo, if there was a chance I could give her some more good time, I would. I took her to her first treatment and everything seemed to go well, she was in treatment for the afternoon, I was able to pick her up after work. When I picked her up it was like I had the old Ginny back, she was lively and engaging and so excited about her meal, which she had not been for a while. These feelings of normalcy lasted for two days, by the time she was due for her next treatment, she was just as tired and worn out as she had been. I was told that this was normal, but I was not sure, it seemed like Ginny was not having the responses that she should have. When I picked her up from the second treatment, she was off, she was not lively like the first time, she just seemed exhausted. Later that night I had to call the animal ER to answer questions about Ginny's condition, she was refusing food and water and just seemed so sick. By the next day her symptoms only intensified, she became incontinent. I decided that this was an indignity that she should not have to suffer, she was having a terrible quality of life and I needed to do right by her. That day, surrounded by loving family members, we let her go, it was the right move, but so hard."
