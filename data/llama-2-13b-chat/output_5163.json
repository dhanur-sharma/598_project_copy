        "Summarize the following story in first person: 10/21/19  (Monday)Dear diary,Today was a great day. This morning I took my dad to his doctors appointment and it went really good. I couldn't sleep all night thinking about today's appointment. The night before my dads appointments is always stressful. I often lay in my bed and think the worse. The doctor told him his blood pressure was looking good and she was decreasing some of his medication. I hate going to the doctors appointments because I never know what to expect. I always think about that Veterans appointment where they revealed his pressure was dangerously high. I wish my dad would get out more often. He really needs a companion. I truly think the war messed him up. I try to do the best I can but sometimes I think its not enough. Even though he is doing good right know, I still worry. The man is 76. God continue to watch over him please."
