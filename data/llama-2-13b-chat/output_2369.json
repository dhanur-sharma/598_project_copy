        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last July, me, my husband, kids, my youngest brother who live with us, and my other brother along with his family who lives in the Philippines met up in Vancouver Canada.  We have a sister who lives in Burnaby and she lives in an apartment along with her family.  It is our tradition to have a vacation together with our families.  It was a very memorable experience because I get to experience it with my siblings.  My sister's apartment's location is just 5 minutes away from the train station and mall.  It is just a 5-minute walk!  I was really impressed because her location is very near to everything that she needed.  I basically go to the mall everyday and I can buy food whenever I wanted.  If I needed some groceries, I will just bring my portable shopping cart and then I will just walk to the grocery stores.  If I wanted to go somewhere, I will just ride the train.  Everything I needed is there.  We also went to some of the tourist spots there including Victoria Island, Capilano Bridge and a lot more.  The Capilano Bridge is really scary because it is long and shaky if people walks really fast.  It was one of the happiest vacations of my life because I get to spend it with my loved ones.  Vancouver is really a beautiful city."
