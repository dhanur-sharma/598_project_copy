        "Summarize the following story in first person: Currently been having money issues. It has gotten to the point that the hospital has even started taking money directly from my husbands checks every few weeks. This has made it very difficult every month. This was an unexpected occurrence for us and is now a significant detriment on our lives. The struggle is severe and it has been hard trying to figure out how to make it work for us. I didn't even know they could do something like that. Now that they have, it has brought us down a worse path. But there is hope and I think we are learning how to survive in this new atmosphere. We are finding a way to make it work for us. It has brought down our demeanor but we continue on to make it work. It is for the best and we struggle. We try to put a smile on. It is amazing this can happen to us. For something like medical needs to get in the way. For us to be so distraught over such things."
