        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was surprised by birthday gift that my husband gave me this year. My husband bought me a car eight months ago as a birthday gift. He did it secretly and I totally had no idea of what he was going to buy me as a birthday gift. On my birthday, he took me to a car dealer. He told me that we were going to try new cars. When we got to the car dealer, we tried several new cars and I was very excited because I really needed a new car since I lost my old car during a car accident not long before. When I got out of a Hyundai car, my husband handed me a car key. I guessed he bought me a new car! Though he did not say a word, I was totally shocked that my husband bought me a new car secretly. He bought me a Hyundai hatchback which was very nice. I especially loved the sunset orange color which was so cute. I was impressed by the materials used by Hyundai which had improved and their look was very modern. I also liked the back-up camera, front and side collision warning, hatchback and audio bluetooth functions.  I hugged my husband at the car dealer because I was so thrilled and touched by his behavior. The new car was very important to me because my beloved old car got totaled during a car accident earlier. This event was very memorable."
