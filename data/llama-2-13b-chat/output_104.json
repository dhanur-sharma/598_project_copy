        "Summarize the following story in first person: A few weeks ago my boyfriend found out his roommate was going to be moving out. He was telling me about it, acting kind of nervous.  We were having dinner together, we had ordered food to his apartment, and having a nice night together. He then stops eating, puts down his fork and turns to me. He tells me that things have been going really well with us and he's been thinking about this for awhile. He says that we spend most nights at the same apartment anyway, and, while it's not the reason he's asking, with his roommate moving out it just makes the most sense to move in together. He reassures me that he's not asking because it's convenient for him, but that he's been wanting to and it's just practical to do it now. We have been dating for about 2 years, and I had been thinking about taking that step too. I tell him that I think it sounds perfect, that I had been thinking about it too. We spend the night talking about how we'll handle it. We discuss where we'll live, if we'll take one of our current apartments or find a new one. We decide to both live at his current apartment, it's bigger then mine since I lived alone and in a good area that is convenient for both of us. It felt so good to be taking this step with him. He doesn't always like to talk about feeling so this shows me where he stand with me and our relationship. I don't remember being that happy for a long time."
