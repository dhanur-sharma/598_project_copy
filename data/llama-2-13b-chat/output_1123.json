        "Summarize the following story in first person: My former best friend I always thought was labeled as a \"former\" for a reason. We had been there for each other a lot, but there was also a lot of trying times. A lot of heartbreak, a lot of anger, a lot of betrayal, but also a lot of good moments. I knew he was getting married, so I did want to be there for him in whatever capacity he wanted me to be in. It was tough to be there initially, because I didn't want to give off the impression I was just there out of pity. A surprising thing happened, however. We hit it off after a while apart and seemingly rekindled the friendship that had burned so brightly for so long. We talked about old times. We certainly talked about dumb things one another did. But we also talked about how he met the love of his life, and also had future plans we all were having. It's a good reminder that a lot of negative feelings are temporary. They fade and fluctuate with the gift of hindsight. We were glad this wedding brought us together. I don't know if we could ever be the best of friends again. But I think we're ready to try."
