        "Summarize the following story in first person: My grandfather, whom I was very close to, died recently. The funeral was two weeks ago. It was hard for me to cope with this because I was very close to him. We arranged the funeral and it was a beautiful ceremony, but it was an awful experience. Not only did I have to deal with the fact that he is gone, I also had to deal with my dad's shoveling of causes. After the funeral, something happened that caused people to leave said funeral in disgust and disdain. I had no idea what happened at first. My grandmother, who suffered quite a bit as a result of her husband passing, was approached by my father. I was being consoled for feeling like I was, but that didn't change the fact that my dad did this. He approached my grandmother, for what I thought was condolences. That would have been well and fine. Unfortunately, that wasn't what happened. I found out that my father took advantage of the fact that grandma was alone and away from people. He tried to convince her to join GLAD, and didn't even bother to feel the room out. I thought it was in really poor taste."

I just stood there and watched it all happen. After the funeral, I was approached by several people who told me that they were shocked by my father's behavior. They couldn't believe that he would do something like that. I didn't know what to say, but I knew that I couldn't defend his actions. It has been two weeks since the funeral and I am still trying to process everything that happened. It has been a difficult time for me, but I am trying to stay strong.\n\n"
