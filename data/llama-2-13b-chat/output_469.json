        "Summarize the following story in first person: Dear Diary,I need to tell you about something that happened to me three months ago.  I would have written about it sooner, but I needed time to process my thoughts about the event, because it was somewhat traumatic.  Now that some time has passed, I think I have enough perspective to talk about it and express how I feel. Three months ago, I wrecked my beautiful truck.  I was coming home from work after the late shift, and it was raining.  I was going down New Road  about 11pm.  I rounded a corner, and there were four deer in the road.  I know right, my greatest fear when driving home at night.  I swerved to miss the deer, which I did successfully, but I went into a spin on the slick wet road.  I slid completely off the roadway and ran into a tree.   Fortunately, I had my seat belt on, because I hit the tree head on.  The airbags deployed and the seat belt did it's job, and I was only shaken up.  The truck was completely totaled and I was so upset about this.  I worked so hard for that truck and I just couldn't believe that God would let this happen to me.   I was upset for weeks.  The insurance did replace the truck, but it just wasn't the same. Now, after several weeks have passed, I realized how ungrateful I was in being upset about the truck.  The important thing is that I walked away completely unhurt.  Not even a scratch.   Trucks you can replace, but I was really fortunate that night. I am going to make a huge effort in the future to be grateful for the important things in life, and care less about the material things."
