        "Summarize the following story in first person: Today my family gathered in a small town. It has been years since we have all been in the same place at the same time. Usually seeing long lost relatives is a joyous occasion for most families. We aren't most families. Usually, we don't all get along. Today wasn't usual. Today we gathered to pay our respect to one of the most complicated men most of us have ever known. Today, we all supported each other and consoled one another in the name of my Dad. My dad passed away a week ago and today was his memorial. This has been a difficult week. Trying to grasp the fact that he is gone has been tough, but today was the worst. We had an open casket. He looked so strange, it was him and yet not him I watched as some of my family broke down into tears, some quietly. Others held it in. I felt I had to be strong for my own little family. My children will never again get to see their grandpa. I will never again get to see my dad, yet as a dad, I couldn't let me kids watch me break down completely. After today, all that will be left him is his belongings and his ashes."
