        "Summarize the following story in first person: Thankfully, the nerve ablations were successful in alleviating a significant amount of pain and inflammation in my thoracic spine!  I was so relieved when the nerves started to die off causing the pain to decrease.  All in all, it was a very good experience.  I think the only downside was having to drive an hour to get to the appointment.  I think that when I need to have the procedure repeated in another year or so, I'd like to explore the town a little before my appointment.  Now that I am fully healed from the procedure, I have been able to become a little more active.  I have done a few moderate hikes and have started to swim again.  It feel so nice to be able to do the things that I love again without causing significant pain.  I plan to start physical therapy soon!  Since my last journal entry, I have sprained two of my ribs in an unrelated incident.  I have needed that to heal some before trying to really stretch and work that area.  It can be frustrating to need so much long term care for all of my spinal injuries.  But I feel so thankful that I have had so much physical and emotional support throughout the years.  And we are able to afford a really great health insurance policy that has taken are of a lot of the procedures and appointments that I've needed.  That has been a huge relief!  My next goal is to get stronger and to find a more natural alternative to some of the medications that I am needing for my spine."
