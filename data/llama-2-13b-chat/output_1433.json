        "Summarize the following story in first person: When I stepped off the plane, I could not believe I was in Paris. I've wanted to visit Paris my whole life! We spent two days just visiting The Louvre. The Mona Lisa was just as enigmatic and interesting as I imagined her being. We went up the Eiffel Tower and surveyed the glittering city below us. We went to so many adorable little cafes and bakeries that I lost count. We went to the Notre Dame Cathedral, which was immense and breathtaking. I couldn't believe I was stepping through the halls of a building that was constructed over 1000 years ago. America isn't even 1000 years old so I've never been in a building that old. We also saw the Sacre-Couer, which is a basilica I had never even heard of before my visit to Paris, but it was an extremely beautiful, gleaming white church. I've always heard Parisians have a reputation for being a little cold and snobbish, but I did not get that impression at all. Everyone was so nice! I practiced my rudimentary French the whole time, and no one said anything rude to me. Several people did kind of smile and insist on speaking English to me, but I get that. It's obviously not easy to communicate with someone speaking very broken French to you. Honestly, I will never forget my trip to Paris, and I'm so glad I got to go."
