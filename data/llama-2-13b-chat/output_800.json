        "Summarize the following story in first person: I recently had a poem of mine published in a literary magazine. As someone who has been writing poetry my whole life, this is huge. I only started submitting my work within the last year, and have been published in many underground publications. However, more recently, I was published in a more established magazine. My friends threw me a congratulatory party, and it blew me away. My party was hosted at a beach house. They had decorated it all pink, and with my initials everywhere. They even cut out and framed my poem and pasted it everywhere. Bits of my writing were adorned throughout the house and the yard. It was also themed! They had it themed around tea parties, which I love. They purchased all sorts of unique teas, including blooming tea. I had never seen blooming tea before, and was amazed, as I love flowers as well. Overall, I had a blast at this party where we all celebrated something very meaningful to me. I am so proud of myself, and I just have the best friends ever. I am so glad that they not only enjoy my work, but love me enough to do something like this for me."
