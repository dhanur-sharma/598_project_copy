        "Summarize the following story in first person: I had a very beautiful trip to the mountains of North Carolina this year.  I got to see the Blue Ridge and the Smoky Mountains up close.  Until then, I had never had a vacation that was centered around nature.  It was always about visiting something that was man-made, some sort of vast structure or sight of historical significance.  It had an immediate impact on me, one of awe.  I was in awe of the vastness and the natural beauty of these structures.  They put everything that I had ever visited that was man-made to shame.  I also felt something deep inside of me that I could not immediately put a name to.  Eventually, I decided it was something like a connection.  I did not feel necessarily connected to a lot of the things I had visited otherwise - beautiful cities which were made by people long before I ever existed.  However, there was a timelessness to the beautiful scenes of nature, and though they existed before me, I felt a connection to them.  They reflected their own place in the universe, and by doing so, helped reflect man's place in the universe.  It was a humbling experience. I was not frightened by the realization that I was smaller in the universe than I thought I was.  In fact, there was a liberating feeling to it.  It's hard to explain."
