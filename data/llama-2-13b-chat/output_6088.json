        "Summarize the following story in first person: Two months ago I attended my best friend's wedding. The day was perfect, mid-spring. The air was cool with the steady and rising warmth that only that part of the season could offer.  The wedding was enveloped in hues of light pink or blush and accented with the type of white only a bride could wear. You would not believe how gorgeous her dress was. The cut was perfect for her shape. The bodice was covered in delicate pearls. Standing by her side on the most important day of her life thus far, was an honor and so much fun. I remember when we were 7, planning our weddings together and watching it come into fruition brings a tear to my eye. The wedding took place on her aunt and uncle's farm with a beautifully renovated barn. All of our friends and her family gathered together to take part in such a wonderful day. The reception went smoothly besides the fact that I tripped on my dress and fell in a very unladylike fashion. I hope one day she will be able to stand by my side just like I did for her. Her newly minted husband is actually someone I like, get along with and feel is deserving of her love and commitment. After 24 year of being my best friend and sister from another mister (haha) my standards of who would one day marry her have always been high. I'm happy to report that just two short months ago my best friend started a lovely journey that will be filled much joy and love."
