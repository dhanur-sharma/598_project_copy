        "Summarize the following story in first person: It finally happened for real. I broke up with my long distance boyfriend for good this time. We had been fighting for multiple days straight a couple months back, and he was being really rude to me over the phone one day. I ended up calling him back and telling him that it was over between us. I didn't want to mince words too much so I kept it short and sweet. It's funny because he didn't even take it that badly. He just kept saying \"okay that's fine\" over and over like he was expecting this conversation. It felt a bit odd. Then he casually dropped the bomb that he had been seeing somebody else, and I lost it. I ripped into him with every swear word imaginable for a few minutes. I honestly can't believe he didn't hang up the phone. Then I pretty much told him what a pile of crap he was and hung up on him. I tossed my phone on the table and thought about how ridiculous it all was. I had called him to break up, and he pretty much was acting like we were already broken up anyway. How insane! I'm glad to be done with him but ugh, that was the worst conversation ever!"
