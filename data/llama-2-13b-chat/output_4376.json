        "Summarize the following story in first person: Belle (not her real name) went to another dentist.  After her very bad experience at the last dentist, where she had a severe syncope episode, she still needed the dental work done. She found a dentist who was much more expensive but/and more expensive. This dentist knew how to coax her through the process without terrifying her. He also was very wise and used the short acting milder numbing agent and Belle got through the procedure with no problems whatsoever. What a relief to her, me and the dental team. Now we just have to pay the bill. >__<  That was not the end of her issues however. Belle had recently landed a very good job, right after high school graduation. It had a starting wage of $15 an hour, which at 17 is fantastic, plus it had room for advancement, also great! She had had two jobs prior, a grocery checking job and a restaurant job, but she'd never worked a full 40 hour week. This proved to be a challenge. One week into the job, she started having syncope episodes at night before bed and during work.  We had to take her to her pediatrician which didn't look good, we felt, to her employer,  for her second week on the job.  Belle felt like she was going to die. We were actually scared that might happen, though I never let her know, how I was feeling, in this regard."

The cardiologist's visit was the next day. The pediatrician gave her a referral to a cardiologist and Belle was to be seen the next day. The cardiologist said that it was just anxiety and panic attacks. He gave her a prescription for Xanax and said she needed to take it before bedtime and/or before a panic attack. He also told her to go to therapy and work on her anxiety and panic attacks. The cardiologist also told her that she was perfectly fine and did not have any heart issues, which was a huge relief to all of us. He also told her to take it easy and not to overexert herself, which was also a huge relief. She was so scared, she didn't know what to do. But, the cardiologist's words of wisdom and the Xanax prescription really helped her. She started taking the Xanax and going to therapy. She also started taking it easy and not overexert"
