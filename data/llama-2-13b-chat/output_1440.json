        "Summarize the following story in first person: Dear Diary,  I'm feeling lost. Back in May I received the news that I was once again being dismissed from the nursing program at Randolph Community College. After putting in sweat, tears and many countless hours I was angry more than anything when I heard the words, \"unfortunately, we cannot let you continue into the program.\" I've had time to process my emotions and cry about it, but even now I still feel angry. But why? Because I gave it my all and the instructors led myself and other students to believe that they would help us pass. I'm not angry at myself, I'm angry at the director, I'm angry at the instructors and more importantly, I'm angry at the college. I understand that I got dismissed the first time because I didn't study enough. But this time? This is on them. More importantly, I'm feeling frustrated. When I try to explain this to my dad, he always takes the college's side and says, \"well you knew what you were in for, didn't you?\" Yeah, I knew what I was in for, but that doesn't justify falsely leading students to believe they are \"safe\" and that we will receive help. I try and remind myself that this is now in the past and there's no going back. All I can do is learn from the experience and continue to move forward. Here is to better opportunities and a brighter future. I can't go anywhere but up from here. This is just a bump in the road."
