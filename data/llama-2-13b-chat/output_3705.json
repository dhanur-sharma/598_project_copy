        "Summarize the following story in first person: My dad fell while delivering pizzas and broke his foot. My  parents were unable to pay their mortgage. They would likely lose their house in a few months. My brothers and I saw did a bit of renovating. A friend of my  brothers helped and gradually cleaned the house out, as we reveled in old memories, and had my parents temporarily move in with me, as I was the only homeowner with space. In the mean mine, I helped my mom and dad  make a budget. We got all their \"stuff\" in order to find an independent living apartment. The wife and I didnt hace the best time. She is a fairly private person and did not want my parents living with us for an indeterminate amount of time. She held strong and they eventually moved out. My parents were a bit traumatized by having to switch locations twice. Also, the room they were in is not heated and they needed a space heater. My brother and my wife healed over time and get along well again. My parents have way less worry. They dont worry about debt, houses or bills anymore."
