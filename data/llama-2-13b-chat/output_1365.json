        "Summarize the following story in first person: A memorable thing that happened to me recently is when my sister moved away.  She moved from New York State to New Mexico.  She is moving because there is more work out there apparently.  We had to spend a lot of time helping her get her stuff ready and get it in boxes.  She drove the whole way there.  My parents and I also had to take care of her cats for a little while, while she was moving all of the stuff out of her apartment.  I think a thing that really surprised me about the whole move was how upset it made my mom.  She seemed really broken up that my sister was going to be so far away.  I think my sister was glad to get away from my parents because they are kind of overbearing.  I was very tired after helping her pack up and move.  I wasn't very sad about her moving away because she is going to a place with more opportunity.  I was kind of upset by how upset my mom was though.  Her cats were very nice when they were staying with us but very shy.  I got her a going away gift basket with some bath and body stuff and toiletries so she wouldn't have to worry about that when she moved in, and also some snacks for the road.  I think she was very excited about moving away and I am somewhat jealous."
