        "Summarize the following story in first person: The morning of my wedding was already very stressful, because I had been planning this whole wedding from another state. We moved unexpectedly in the middle of my engagement, so I was doing almost all of the wedding plan site unseen of the venue. I was monitoring the weather leading up to my wedding for weeks, as soon as I could see a two week forecast on Weather. com! The weather looked like it would be hot, but there did not seem to be any chance of thunderstorms until the day before the wedding. I wasn't too worried about it when I first woke up, because it was very sunny and hot out. My bridesmaids and I went to get our hair done, and my family went to the venue to start setting up. The day was already rushed because it is so easy to get behind and we had a strict deadline for when the wedding needed to be over. We finally arrived at the venue around 2pm. We began to take some family photos and some first look photos, and the day was still very sunny. I went inside to freshen up before the ceremony at 5, and I noticed it was starting to get darker and windy. I could hear commotion out in the hall, and finally, a huge crack of thunder. All of the guests had already arrived, so they ran to help my husband get the chairs out of the rain and into the banquet hall. They just made it before a deluge of rain. The storm passed in about 15 minutes, and then we had to set everything up outside again. However, the wedding really came together with all of our friends and family helping out. We only start the ceremony about 20 minutes late, and there was a rainbow there as we said our vows. It ended up being perfect!"
