        "Summarize the following story in first person: THE BIRTH OF MY SWEET NIECE,MY SISTER HAD A LOT OF TROUBLE TRYING TO GET PREGNANT.  IT WAS REALLY HEARTBREAKING BECAUSE I HAVE 3 KIDS AND ONE I HAD AT 42.  I DID NOT HAVE ANY ISSUES.  AFTER YEARS OF TRYING MY SISTER AND HER HUSBAND WERE ABLE TO SAVE UP THE MONEY TO TRY IN VITRO FERTILIZATION.  THIS IS NOT AN EASY PROCESS AND IT SCARED AND WORRIED MY SISTER.  I WAS THERE THRU THE WHOLE PROCESS WITH THE SHOTS AND OVERALL STRESSES OF THE EVENTS.  WHEN SHE FOUND OUT SHE WAS PREGNANT, WE WERE SO HAPPY.  WE ALSO DID NOT GET OVERLY EXCITED UNTIL SHE HIT 12 WEEKS.  SHE WAS SO GOOD DURING THE PREGNANCY.  I KNOW SHE WAS UNDER SOME STRESS TOO.  SHE DID EVERYTHING THAT WAS ASKED OF HER AND MORE.  I WENT TO A FEW OF HER APPOINTMENTS.   EEVERYTHING FROM START TO FINISH WAS GREAT.  AT THE 35 WEEK MARK SHE ASKED ME TO COME OVER.  I WENT TO SEE HER AND SHE ASKED IF I WOULD BE IN THE ROOM WITH HER AND HER HUSBAND.  I WAS OVER THE MOON EXCITED.  I HAD NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD GET TO BE ON THIS END SO TO SPEAK! HER DELIVERY WAS SCHEDULED TO MAKE THINGS EASIER.  I SHOWED UP AT THE HOSPITAL AROUND 7AM FOR THE 8AM INDUCTION. THE THING THAT I REMEMBER THE MOST WAS HOW CALM AND PEACEFUL THE WHOLE THING WAS.  SHE DID GREAT AND WE WERE ALL SO RELAXED DURING THE PROCESS.  HER CONTRACTIONS WERE MILD AND SHE WAS ABLE TO GET THE EPIDURAL EARLY TO HELP ELIMINATE THE STRESS ON HER AND THE BABY.  SHE DID HAVE TO PUSH FOR ABOUT 45 MINUTES SO THAT WAS A LITTLE TIRING FOR HER.  MY SWEET NIECE WAS BORN AROUND 3:45 IN THE AFTERNOON AND SHE WAS PERFECT.  WE WERE ALL TEARED UP BUT NOTHING DRAMATIC."
