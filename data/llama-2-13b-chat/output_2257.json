        "Summarize the following story in first person: Three months ago, my husband was told that he was able to start walking again. He was in a car accident about a year ago, and he was been getting around with a knee scooter. It's been difficult, but we are grateful that he is still with us. The damages to the vehicle were extensive, and it was totaled. He had spent 1 full month in the hospital. He also underwent 3 separate surgeries. When we were told that he could start walking, I was elated. It has been hard to see him this way. He is extremely independent and active, but this accident took this away from him. I have been watching him get back into the groove of walking, and it has been inspiring and uplifting. We also share a 2 year old son, so now I can watch them walk together. The past 3 months have been a turn around in our lives. We expected that he was going to be not walking for longer, so knowing that he is healthy and healing quickly makes me feel more at ease as well. Everything can change in an instant. It is so important to be grateful and aware of your gifts."
