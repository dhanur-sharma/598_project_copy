        "Summarize the following story in first person: Well I seem to have made a new friend today. More importantly I have a new four legged roommate. I was sitting in my car waiting for Beth to get out of school when all of a sudden I her a thud on the hood of my car. I looked and saw the biggest cat I've ever seen standing there looking at me. Then this furry beast jumped threw the open window and into my lap. He looked right at me then kneaded my lap and sat down. By the time Beth jumped into the back seat he was purring away like a little engine. Of course she was smitten right away. She went on about how cute and friendly he was. According to Beth the cat had chosen us so now we needed to take him home. I'm a big softy when it comes to animals so we headed to the pet store. An hour later Tom-Tom had a new litter box and scratching post. Not to mention a nice soft bed and a huge bag of cat food.  When we got home he leaped out of my arms and strod into the house like he owned it. I guess cats really do choose their people."
