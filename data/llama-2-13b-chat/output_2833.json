        "Summarize the following story in first person: My friend and I had an argument. It was over something really stupid and shouldn't have happened to begin with. It was basically my fault for letting things happen that happened. I really feel responsible for what happened and the way thing ended up. We went a while without talking because of it and I hate that. I care a lot about that friend and have been friends with her for over 20 years. I don't want anything like that to ever happen between us again. Things still aren't back to normal between us and I really want them to go back the way that they used to be. I don't know if she wants them to or not. We are both really in different areas in our lives right now and have drifted apart. I still care so much about her and always have and always will. I just really want my friend back the way things used to be. I hope and pray some day that they will be the way that they used to be. I've tried calling her and she didn't answer but she will respond to a text message. She will text me at times also. I'm not going to give up on her."
