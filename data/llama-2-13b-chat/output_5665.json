        "Summarize the following story in first person: A few months ago I attended a music festival in Orlando. I was invited by my best friend, his girlfriend and her sister. I was originally going to decline the invitation but I was able to get the weekend off at work so I decided I would go. We left Saturday afternoon and arrived in Orlando later that night. After arriving there , we went out to dinner with some of our friends who live in town. We were able to catch up on our lives for a couple of hours before we headed to the hotel to check in and sleep. The next day we got up and went to breakfast to get our stomachs full for a day of drinking and dancing. After filling our bellies we went to a liquor store to get out party supplies and then headed back to the hotel to pre-game. Afterwards, we went to the location of the festival and let the sounds of the electronic music move our bodies. I usually don't dance much but the alcohol changed my entire mindset. I found myself shuffling and dancing to the music as if I did it for a living. I had an absolute blast dancing all along the edge of the pool with the other party goers. This went on for about five hours before the rain started falling. It was then that we decided that our age was catching up to us and decided to call it a night. We went out to eat before heading back to the hotel to rest up for the trip back home the next day. It was an absolute blast of a weekend and I wouldn't mind going again."
