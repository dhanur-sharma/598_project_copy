        "Summarize the following story in first person: I had been feeling for a while that I haven't been living up to my expectations as a parent. I wanted to change that because I remember that I had a really fun childhood. My parents really went above and beyond to make sure I enjoyed my time as a kid. I've always held those values with me and wanted to pass them along to my daughter. So, I brainstormed ideas and I settled on the idea of setting up a movie theater in the backyard. I went online and did some research to get some inspiration on how to set it up. Once I had a solid idea of how I wanted to pull it off, I went to work researching projectors to find the best bang for my buck. I found a few on Amazon that I liked and, upon watching reviews on YouTube, I picked the one that was best. Surprisingly, it wasn't that expensive. I think I paid less than $300 for the whole setup. After I placed the order, I looked at my schedule to find a good night to do the movie night. When I had the details figured out, I informed my wife and she loved the idea. Before long, the movie projector came and tested it in my office while my daughter was playing outside. The quality and ease of use were impressive. It was able to be hooked up to a DVD player or a phone/tablet, which was perfect for us. I then waited until the night that I wanted to set things up. That day, she was out playing with friends and I was in the backyard secretly setting things up. I moved deck furniture and put a big blanket on the lawn. By the time i was done, it looked like a miniature living room. We then prepared snacks and broke the news to my daughter. She jumped up and down with joy before running to the backyard and freaking out over the setup. We had popcorn, candy, and sodas while watching the movie that night. It was so much fun and I really liked creating those memories for her. I felt really good afterwards and feel like I fulfilled my duties as a fun parent. At the end, my daughter ran up and hugged/kissed me and told me I was the best dad ever."
