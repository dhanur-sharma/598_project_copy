        "Summarize the following story in first person: I am fascinated by old cemeteries, so when I had the chance to return to Alaska, I knew exactly where I would go.  I had been to the Eklunta spirit houses four times before, and was looking forward to the visit.  I took my kids with me this time. I want them to experience the feeling I got on my first visit.  We get out of the car, and walk the distance to the spirit houses.  It is a cold and peaceful morning as we approach the groups of brightly colored small buildings on the ground.  I explain the history of the cemetery to the kids. The kids are not as religious as I am, and they do not have the connection to the Alaskan people I do, so they did not understand. I walk off by myself to pay my respects.  I stop at each of the little buildings that contained the graves.  I take in the colors, I think about how the family must have felt painting the colors on the little shelters.  Tears come to my eyes.  The native people fascinate me.  They have managed to both embrace a new religion, yet keep their old traditions.  I can feel the peace here, the love.  I stay as long as I can, I could stay all day.  I will surely return as I seem to be called back to this special place at least once a year."
