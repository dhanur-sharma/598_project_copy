        "Summarize the following story in first person: Sleeping in surgical waiting rooms is the worst. I mean, I never met a medical waiting room I liked, but at least in a doctor's office or the emergency room, there are other people, things happening, a sense of progress. Surgical waiting rooms are separate, special, and if you're in one in the middle of the night it's just your group, alone, waiting for news. It makes funerals feel good. With my sister's brain cancer in some ways, it's a little bit like we never got to leave that room. The outcome of her surgery wasn't bad. It turned out that her cancer was much less aggressive and serious than they originally believed. It wasn't good either, though. The tumor was in a dangerous spot, and they couldn't safely remove it. So we're back to normal now, and for the most part, everything is great, but in some sense, we're still just waiting. This has all been much worse for Sarah, of course, so I completely understand that she's been determined not to let this whole thing dictate how she lives. More than that, maybe. I'm not sure she isn't to some degree making decisions just to prove that she isn't letting herself be limited. That's a little scary, the idea that just maybe her choices are based more on pushing her boundaries rather than doing what's really best for her. She's excited about her new job, though, and I'm certainly not going to try to tell her she shouldn't take it. There are great doctors in Amsterdam, too, and she seems confident that she's got the insurance all figured out. There isn't even really anything I can do to show support, other than congratulating her and wishing her luck. I'll just hope and worry, and keep it to myself."
