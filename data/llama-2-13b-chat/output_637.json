        "Summarize the following story in first person: I can relate to this because while I wasn't admistted to a psychiatric ward, I did suffer depression about 25 years ago.  I had just broken up wtih my long-time boyfriend (who I was in a long-distance romance with for the last year of our relationship) and the breaking up was not of my doing. At that point in time, I was prepared to move back to his state (California) and we were to get married.  He decided he no longer wanted that even though he still loved me.  So, here I was, in the Midwest, just having quit my job and thinking, \"now what\"?  I fell into a deep depression that was only quashed by some one-on-one therapy sessions (and after that didn't work), a visit to a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with clinical depression.  At that time, anti-depressants weren't all that available but I was prescribed one and took it for 6 months.  A horrible situation in my life but I got better and moved on.  Although I moved on, when describing my inner self to a friend, I say that something in me died.  I'm fine; I laugh; I enjoy a good time with friends, but there's a part of me that died with that experience and I have never gotten it to come back to life.  I feel that I am an \"almost whole\" person but not quite complete as a result of that time in my life.  I don't wish it on anybody.  I can completely empathize with the summary above.  I know what it is like to experience depression.  It is a horrible place to be in, mentally.  But the good news is that there is help, even for those who fall into the deep pit of despair, as I did.  One of the worst parts for me was that I saw how it affected those around me.  I was staying with my Mom for a while during this time, and she would cry (in private but I knew that she was crying because of me.    It hurt her to her core that I was going through this.  This was a period that I'd much rather forget, but know I never will."
