        "Summarize the following story in first person: Three months ago my family had an unexpected crisis. I was evicted from my apartment. I have a fiancee and two cats and we had no where to go.  This was really hard to cope with and I did not know what to do to make it better. I had no choice but to live out of my car with my family for about two months.  Being homeless and living out of a car is not something I would want anybody to go through. It hard and embarassing and crushing to your self-esteem. I felt like I had no control over my life and that I did not do enough to keep a roof over my head. And the cats hated being stuck in a car, can you imagine that added stress. Finally my fiancee's parents said we could stay with them until we got back on our feet again. Although I was grateful for this it was uncomfortable living with people who have such hateful opinions of gays/lesbians. I dont have these feelings so I did my best to ignore that because like I said I was grateful for a place to stay. We are slowly getting back on our feet and I hope that it continues. Its not fun being homeless. I only faced this issue for a small amount of time compared to others. I am hopeful for the future."
