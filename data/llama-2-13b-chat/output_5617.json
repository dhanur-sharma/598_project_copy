We started going down all the local alleys. We saw a lot of authentic things. We saw houses in the true local style. We saw a lot of old and forgotten  structures. However, most importantly, we saw a great local band. They were playing in a quiet alley. Perhaps doing a practice run before a local gig. We stood and watched them. It was such great music. They sang and played graciously. I took a video of it, and showed my friends. Everyone agreed it was really good."
