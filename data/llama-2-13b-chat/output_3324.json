        "Summarize the following story in first person: I took my niece out for a day of fun, which was rare. Even though we live close to each other, my sister is very strict with her. I finally got permission to take her out, so we went to a few places she wanted to go to. We went to the store first to get her a toy. I always buy her a toy when we go out, but was hoping she'd choose something cheap. I ended up getting her more than I had planned, but it worked out because I got a discount. We then went to get ice cream. This is also something we always do. We went to a mom and pop place and the person there loved my niece and said how cute she was. She ended up giving us our ice cream for free! After that, we went to my house to see my dog, Finn. She loves dogs, but her mom won't let her get one. Talking to her in the car rides to and from places was one of the best parts of the day just because of how many funny things she says. She has a similar sense of humor to my mom and I. We went for dinner next. I want to say it was Red Robin, but I'm not 100 percent sure. We ended up getting a discount once again. I forget how much money I saved that day. But it was very fun being with her. I took her back home, played a bit, and that was that."
