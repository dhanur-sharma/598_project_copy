        "Summarize the following story in first person: My husband left our country for the United states around 5 years ago. He comes home few times a year and as soon as he got his citizenship, he wanted me to join him. I prepared all I could and have a travel agency arrange my flight. My visa was approved luckily. I packed all my stuffs and left for the airport. I landed in United States the following day and I was welcomed by my husband. After settling in for a while, my husband started processing for my green card. We went for the green card interview. It was a very fast process but the officer responding to us insisted on us proving that our marriage was real and not some sham. We showed her all old pictures we had together. This includes our wedding pictures. She was convinced after seeing that we were married even before my husband came to United States. My green card was approved the next day and I easily became a citizen. I was so happy. The process was a very easy one for me."
