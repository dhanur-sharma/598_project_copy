        "Summarize the following story in first person: I haven't written into my diary in a while, so maybe it's a good idea to get this thing updated again. The big thing is that about four months ago, I found out my rat of a husband has been cheating on me. I saw his phone light up one night with a text message while he was in the bathroom, and let's just say that the content of the message was not exactly \"work related\" like he tried to convince me of. After a long fight where he denied everything, I took his phone and called the number who sent the text. A woman answered, as expected. His face immediately went bright red. Then he confessed everything. Apparently he had been seeing this woman for about two years. When I heard that my jaw basically hit the floor, and I pretty much lost it at that point. We have been married for 20 years for pete's sake! His job forces him to travel quite often for overnight stays, so it makes perfect sense. I always suspected he could cheat on me at one of those conventions he attends for work, but he honestly never gave me a sign or a red flag. What a jerk! Anyway, there's not much left to be said about our relationship, or what is left of it. I filled out the divorce paperwork last week and it should be finalized soon. Right now though I'm just looking out for me, and focused on moving to a new stage of my life!"
