        "Summarize the following story in first person: My husband and I finally ran out of our home last week. We moved into a haunted house three months ago. We have heard stories of people dying in her because of suffocation. I believe it, since we both had trouble breathing sometimes in the home. That was the least of our worries. In the morning. the table would budge by itself. We thought  it was a small earthquake, but this happened every morning. There would be spoons that would just fly out of our cereal. There would be ghosts in the mirror. Glass would just suddenly crack. Black cats would just start talking to us. There would be a broom that would fly out of nowhere. We thought we were on drugs but we never take drugs. We had to call a priest to ward the house off after we stormed out of there."
