        "Summarize the following story in first person: It's been a whirlwind month for my family and I. Just as we finally saved enough for a down payment on a new home, we also got hit by one of the worst hurricanes the state has ever seen. Our soon to be new home was flooded! I was shocked and very upset. I can remember the exact moment when we were told by the realtor that the sale may not happen at all. The house would have to be reinspected. I prayed that things would work out. About a week after the original closing date the news came in. We would be able to move in! We were all very happy, especially my son Jimmy. Coincidentally, this was also Jimmy's birthday week. Jimmy was so excited not only about the house, but his birthday. He's always very excited when it comes to this time of year. So this year we decided to do something special. We organized a fourth birthday party and housewarming party all in one! We wanted to share this special time with all our friends and family who were very supportive all along. I can remember the joy on little Jimmy's face that day. It's something I'll never forget."
