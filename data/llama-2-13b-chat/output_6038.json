        "Summarize the following story in first person: Four months ago, my friend Beth asked me about her boyfriend Tommy again. I wasn't sure how to respond, since Tommy has been very abusive to her throughout their entire relationship, to the point of isolating her from most of her friends, including me at many times. Beth asked me whether she thought marrying Tommy was a good idea. I hesitated to respond, although she noticed my disapproval. She plans to marry him either way, I can tell, she is still under his spell. So told her I would be supportive of any decision that she made, and that I would always be there for her if she needed me. We hugged, and she began to cry. I asked her what was wrong, and she told me how she often had doubts about their relationship. She really loves Tommy, she said, but also acknowledged that things had been rocky between them for a while. I asked her to tell me more, even though I knew exactly what she meant. I was the one often called after an incident, either a drunken fight or simply a instance where she wasn't allowed to see her friends. She didn't mention the abuse, almost as if in denial, and instead talked about some of their financial challenges and the stress they were putting on the relationship. She seemed to think that once these challenges were resolved, everything would return to normal between Tommy and her. I knew this was not the case. They met when they were young, still in college, before any of us had jobs, and even then Tommy was always abusive, at least verbally."

I just hugged her again, and she thanked me for being there for her. As she walked away, I felt a mix of sadness and anger. I knew that I should have said more to her, but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. I felt like I was failing her by not speaking up, but at the same time, I didn't want to lose her friendship."
