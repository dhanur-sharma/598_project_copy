        "Summarize the following story in first person: I must tell you about the even I attended recently. As you know my daughter is now in Kindergarten. They were wrapping up their school year and they had been practicing for a presentation for months. I know what you are thinking, how good will a presentation from little kids be? I was shocked. It was great. They put on a presentation about the founding of our country. They had one child playing Alexander Hamilton and another playing Ben Franklin. They went through all of the major events and it was great. Even though it doesn't seem like they knew what they were talking about it was so funny. The most surprising event was when my child, dressed like George Washington, started break dancing. It was so funny, every one was rolling with laughter. It actually made me recall my own child hood. One of my favorite parts of grammar school was the month before Christmas break where we would plan our Christmas assembly. It was fun learning the songs and it was also fun skipping regular classes. I am glad my child can do something as memorable as that."
