        "Summarize the following story in first person: After a normal morning at work I got in my car to head to run an errand then off to meet coworkers for lunch. After my first errand I was driving to my second errand when I received a call from my sister. After answering and saying \"ya sis\", the last thing you ever want to hear is intense sobbing and intelligible words on the other end. Clearly something was horribly wrong and I finally was able to make out that our father had unexpectedly passed. I told my sister I would be there in 10 min. I distinctly recall a bird chirping at a stoplight, a fly in my car, and a large 4 wheel drive truck next to me blaring some rock music. While a flood of different emotions from denial, to anger, to fear, to feeling lost, raced through my mind on the drive over they all dissipated when I pulled in to the park where my parents lived and saw the red and blue flashing lights of many police cars, an ambulance, and fire trucks surrounding my parent place. My heart sank. Immediately found my mom and sisters and we did our best to comfort each other eventually turning our attention to our mother as she had been with my dad since being a teenager, now 63, and she knew nothing else. Spoke with the police and they eventually agreed to allow only myself in to see my father. He had died in his bed from a suspected, turned out to be true, drug overdose. Everything was a blur after that for the next few days. After we got through the funeral we turned our attention to our mom and her future. She couldnt stay there anymore, so we sold the place in a few weeks time. But now we had to find out where mom would live. Eventually we decided she would be primarily with my little sister and her family, but she could rotate around and stay with myself and my other sister if/when she wanted to. The first 3 months were the most difficult for my mom, but I am happy to say eventually the sun did begin to shine again for her, and us, and my mom is happier than ever and has a new job. And the rest of us have also, and continue to, settle into our new reality and we just keep getting up everyday and doing the only thing we can do, keep going forward in life."
