        "Summarize the following story in first person: This story is about my family's recent vacation to Myrtle Beach, and the subsequent heart attack my wife's father suffered while there.  We had planned a week long vacation to the beach, travelling from Ohio in order to spend time with my family, including my parents and brother, and my wife's parents, and our 2 children.  After having fun for 4 days, my father in law awoke Thursday morning complaining of some pain in his jaw and heartburn.  My father in law and his wife felt that they should conservatively go to the hospital to get checked out.  Unfortunately, a blood test returned with slightly elevated enzyme numbers, meaning some minor heart damage may have occurred.  No problem we though, just a few more tests and a ruined day of vacation.  Well, after heart catheter, the really bad news came in.  My father in law would need quadruple bypass surgery immediately.  They scheduled him for surgery Monday morning, and he would have to stay in Myrtle Beach for another few weeks after the surgery until he was allowed to fly home.  What I will remember the most is visiting my father in law on Friday morning at the hospital and letting him visit with his grandchildren.  He was so stone faced and obviously scared and in mental anguish.  I gave him a hug goodbye, since I had to drive my kids home on Saturday, and he was in tears.  It was very painful to witness that.  Fortunately, my wife was going to stay with her mom and dad for a few more days to get through the surgery and help any way she could.  In excellent news, my father in law had a perfect surgery and is now recovering getting stronger every day.  The whole sequence of events is a good reminder to take life one day at a time, and appreciate all that we are given.  Hopefully we have many more years of his presence to make many more memories."
