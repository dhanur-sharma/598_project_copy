        "Summarize the following story in first person: Three weeks ago, something pretty devastating happened. I was sitting on the couch with my husband, and I got a phone call about our previous foster children, Mark and Sarah. Their mother was arrested for breaking and entering. When I heard this news, my heart dropped. All we ever wanted was the best for them. I truly thought they were in good hands! Their mother really seemed to be going on the right track... I thought there was no way she would go back to her previous lifestyle. Then I thought, \"will I have to go back to MY previous lifestyle now?\" These children need to be taken care of, and it's clear that their mother can't do that anymore. But my husband and I weren't prepared for that task. It had been three years since we took care of those kids. We are used to our lives. Things are quiet. We have more freedom and flexibility. I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a pain to take care of those kids. Of course, we loved them like they were our own, but they were quite the handful. The most shocking part of the situation, however, was my husband's response. He was supportive (for once). He said he wouldn't mind if I took on less hours at work if I wanted to take the kids back. I knew I married him for a reason. We may not agree on everything, but the man has a big heart. We haven't heard any more  news about those poor kids or their mother. For now, our life will remain quiet and comfortable. But it's nice to know that my husband is supportive of welcoming Mark and Sarah back."
