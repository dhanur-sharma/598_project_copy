I look for my phone but its not on my bedside table, I get a tight knot on my stomach, I panic, I look at the clock,its past midnight, He is never this late, what could have happened to him, I ask. I go to the sitting room and get my phone, I dial his number, its rings he does not pick, I try several times but nothing. I am so nervous now, I have this terrible feeling deep down, then a text comes through, I open it and my heart even sunk deeper, the text read \" don't look for me, I am fine, you pushed me to her arms\".  I feel weak. I go back and sit on my bed. we had been arguing, we even were seeing our pastor with our Marital issues. You see, I had recently discovered that my husband was cheating on me. he had a baby with another woman. I found it very hard to forgive him, he told me she was a non issue and that I should not worry about her. he promised me he had terminated the affair but he could support the child. All I had asked was a little time to wrap my head around the issues involved. but he had suddenly decided to move in with this woman. I was heart broken, we have children together. we were married in church. how was I going to do it on my own?"
