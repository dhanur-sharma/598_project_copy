        "Summarize the following story in first person: A few weeks ago we had our first christmas living together as a couple. There was a lot to do, a lot ot get ready, and a lot of stress. My girlfriend has been struggling with a really nasty infection that's been keeping her more or less bedridden up until around 12/20, which, as a casual observer will note, is pretty close to christmas. Because of that, most of the getting ready for the holiday fell onto my shoulders, and I'd be lying if I said that dealing with it all wasn't super stressful on my end, and that I had a hard time coping with bearing the brunt of it alone. When it actually came to christmas time, she had a bad flare up and as a result couldn't really do anything. So together, instead of going to her family's that day, spent the day together, exchanging gifts and relaxing and doing us, being the happy couple we always have been .Luckily, the night before we were able to go see her aunt and maternal family, as she always does on christmas eve. That was a really nice time, and a first for me since during those holidays I'd have spent my time with my own family, due to us living so far apart before moving in together. The thing that stood out to me most, I think, was how relaxing and just, generally nice it felt. Being with them, and with her, really made the holiday something special. I felt like a member of the family with them more than I'd ever felt with my own and it really contrasted with the past few years. Afterwards, we headed home and collapsed at around 9pm, her due to sickness and me due to the stress of the season. When we got up, she was hardly in any state to do anything and we, as mentioned above, just had a day for us. I cooked us some macaroni and cheese, we opened presents and watched Christmas movies. It was a nice time for us. We spent the next week playing catch up and seeing all her family that we were supposed to see on Christmas."
