        "Summarize the following story in first person: We decided to have a very traditional wedding to make my partner's family feel at home. He happens to have an entire cultural background that is just not much practiced by him but his parents do. He's from a pretty religious background but isn't all that religious these days. Regardless, at around 12PM we would have the traditional ceremony, and then again at around 3PM we would have the normal wedding. We live in a small town or smallish city really so this was all rather exciting for my friends and family. He dressed in traditional robes and we had a change of clothes. What was amazing is that everyone observed the singing, the use of sand and glass to make the gestures that were required and just altogether made that ceremony amazing. We had some drinks and lunch at around 2 and at 3PM again we congregated at a church for my traditional ceremony. My partner looked handsome in his suit and everything was perfect. The priest was hilarious and cracked jokes the entire time, making everyone laugh and feel comfortable. At the reception we took photos and performed our unexpected first dance, breaking it down hiphop style to some 2pac. Everyone loved it. We laughed, and ate the delicious food, including some traditional malay type food which my partner hadn't had in forever but everyone really enjoyed. As the evening wore on we drank beers and wine and got a little too silly. We managed to get back to our hotel late, nearly 2 AM and we crashed in a heap on the bed. It was an awesome day and wonderful day I think I'll remember for the rest of my life."
