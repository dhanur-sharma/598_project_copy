        "Summarize the following story in first person: Two months ago, I was a young, happily-married mother of a two-year-old boy, expecting our second, a little girl, at any moment.  It had been an easy pregnancy, like my first, and there was no reason to think anything could be wrong. I'd had great prenatal care all the way through the pregnancy and totally trusted my doctors. So when I finally went into labor, I knew I'd be in good hands, and my main concern was meeting our baby daughter (and having the pain of labor and delivery be finished.)  My husband Joe took me to the hospital when the contractions indicated that they really meant business this time. We got there quickly, and within minutes, I was in a very comfortable, well-appointed labor-and-delivery room. My doctor soon showed up and hooked me up to the fetal monitor, which showed things like our little girl's heart rate.   The first sign anything was awry was evidenced by my sweet-natured doctor's expression.  She explained to us that our little girl was showing signs of distress, with a raised heartbeat and other signs.  This meant it was crucially important to deliver our baby quickly, which might necessitate a Caesarean.   However, the labor was progressing along quite quickly, so it was very possible the C-section could be averted.  The doctor and attending nurse monitored me closely, and as soon as I was fully dilated, which happened quickly, I was instructed to push as hard as I possibly could.  After several extremely intense and painful contractions and gut-ripping pushes, our little sweet one, to be named Carla, was out.  But something was very wrong.  While newborns are generally bluish when they are born, Carla was a deep purplish.  After letting us give her a too-brief cuddle, the doctors (now there was another) whisked her away for examination and further testing.  Joe and I were very worried we'd lose her, but the doctors reassured us that we were in the right place, and she would probably be fine. They had dealt with births like this before, they assured us, but we were terrified of losing her.... or something else going wrong...  About 45 minutes later, our doctor stepped back into the room.  Joe and I anxiously waited to hear the news, which was better, but definitely not perfect. Carla, the doctor explained, had been born with a small hole in her heart which caused a heart murmur, an irregular sounding beat.  It would need to be tracked and monitored, and possibly might be treatable when she got older, but for now, we would just watch and wait, and she would be fine.  A little later, our beloved newborn was wheeled back into the room, with a much healthier color."
