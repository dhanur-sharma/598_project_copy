        "Summarize the following story in first person: Well, I'm still laid off. I'm still actively looking for work, but I'm honestly very frustrated.  Our finances and savings are depleted.  I don't know how we'll make our mortgage payment next month.  I really need to get some employment.  I recently read an article that said applying for jobs through online methods and job boards is very, very ineffective.  While I agree with this statement, I don't know where else to turn in looking for a job.  The article states that the most effective way to search for work is by networking.  That sounds very good and all, but I don't feel like my network really has any leads for me at the moment.  I've been thinking about doing a more in-depth search through my LinkedIn profile.  I'm beginning to feel like a failure as a provider, husband, and father.  I feel ashamed of the example I've set for my family.  Some days it is difficult getting out of bed or being productive.  Other days seem better and I do get some things done. Have I written enough yet?"
