He shouted at me. I was very scared. I gave him my wallet. It had about $150 in it plus my credit cards. He ran off after I gave him my wallet. I called the police and they took down my story. I had to cancel all my credit cards. It was very harrowing for me.  I was very scared of the event and I think about it alot these days."
