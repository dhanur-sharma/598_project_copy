        "Summarize the following story in first person: I am slightly estranged from my Dad, but last Spring he and my step Mom brought us some furniture and stayed for a few visit. We had some dinner, drank some wine, sat around playing guitar, as when I was young and my Dad was teaching me chords. I was eager to play a song for him, but he said nothing memorable to me when I was done, and the night wound down.         I was not really overwhelmed by his openness towards me, and a little sad that the song I'd learned and played just for him, my original Guitar Teacher, received no \"Wow\"!,  but recently my oldest son went out to see Grandpa for a visit. He came back and told me that my Dad was interested in learning finger picking on guitar after listening to me play. I cried a little, thinking of all the times in my life that a kind word from my father would have made a difference. Still waters the eyes to think of it. The thing is, my son bridged the gap, made me rethink my Dad. You do that any way as you age. I guess Mark Twain was an early bloomer when he said he was amazed by how much smarter his Dad had gotten when Twain turned 21. I am still reconsidering what I once thought of as a lifetime of him trying to Father and Son Song me into silence. ( From the moment I could talk, I was ordered to listen, thank you to Yusuf Islam.) I guess I will always chase the approval I feel I didn't get, but I am trying to learn to accept the past and at the very least know that I can give my kids what I didn't get. Do I have the same Dad outside? Yes. But the one I carry in my head and heart is changing. It is never too late to have a happy childhood."
