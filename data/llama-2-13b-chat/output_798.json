        "Summarize the following story in first person: Wow, I had the best day today! I've just said goodbye to the last friend who had attended my party today. I didn't even know that there would be a party. After work when I arrived home at my apartment, I was surprised by my roommates and friends surrounded by party decorations, food and drinks. It was all because of that poem that I wrote- it was published in a fantastic literary magazine last week and I guess my friends wanted to congratulate me! I was so happy and grateful to see them all there to celebrate and it was such a nice thing to go to all that effort for me. I loved all of the snacks they had picked out, they were actually themed after famous poets! Of course they asked me to read my poem out loud. I was so embarrassed, but I gave it my best. Thankfully, everyone seemed to authentically enjoy it. I felt so grateful and proud about the whole thing. My friends are the best, I can't wait to do something nice like this for them too. Now I am just thinking about my next move in the poetry game. I think maybe I could do  big things if I take advantage of the momentum. I am really feeling inspired. Tonight I'll even write a poem about my feelings."
