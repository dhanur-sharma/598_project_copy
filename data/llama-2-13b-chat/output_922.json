        "Summarize the following story in first person: When I graduated business school is what a memorable day. It was on the most memorable days ever. I had worked hard to business school and my entire family came to see the occasion. I spent many nights staying up late studying. I was happy that I was done business school  but also sad that I would no longer be able to see my friends each day. I would try thou to still be in contact with my fellow classmates. I was surprised at the end of the ceremony that I was given an award for my leadership study I had done while attending the school. I did not know I was even in the running for this award. I got a medal as well as a nice certificate. I have the medal in my office to remind me of my hard work.  This is a big deal for me because it will allow me to advance my career and help my family moving forward. I did not cry during the event but I did come close to crying many times. Anytime I think of this day I smile. It was one of the few times my entire family was together. I wish I could go back and relieve this day again."
