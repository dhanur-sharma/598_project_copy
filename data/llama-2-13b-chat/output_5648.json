        "Summarize the following story in first person: August 7th, 2019. I have just moved all my belongings from the motel into my new apartment. The nightmare is over. It is a new day now and I can get on with my life. Granted, I still have a lot of stuff in a storage locker and I need to find another job, but I don't have to deal with all the issues of that last house anymore. I will have to put more thought into how I choose roommates in the future. It started out pretty good. I was in school and everyone was pulling their weight. It didn't take long though for my younger roommates to not be reliable for rent and utilities. That kind of stuff reflects badly on me. Additionally they were very messy. Dirty clothes draped over furniture and stacks of dirty dishes was the norm. The smell would get badly sometimes. My girlfriend noticed it and it was awkward. I am so glad I know how to clean up after myself and these issues won't be a problem anymore. It might be more expensive for this single apartment but I am thankful. My cats seem to like it but they probably also miss the backyard of the last place. It was a wonderful house, I just wish they took better care of it. I certainly tried to."
