        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was the greatest feeling ever.  I finally was in my dream job. I finished my degree, I went to the interview, and I completely nailed it. It took me so long to get my Master's degree too. It finally felt to me like all my hard work was paying off. I would never forget that day. I even went out with my mom and dad to celebrate, it was so big of an event. Once I actually started working, I found I loved the job even more. I finally felt like I had the perfect job. I finally knew what all those people I had thought were crazy were talking about when saying they had a job that wasn't a job. To me, my job was just so much better than any job I ever did. That's where the good part ends. My boss had never liked me. This was so extremely scary to me, because I had never done anything to my boss to make him act this way. He simply felt that I was performing so well that I would go after his position. I didn't care about all that, but what did he know. After eight wonderful months, I was let go. I will never forget this, as I view it as a great injustice. I don't think I'll ever have a job as good again."
