        "Summarize the following story in first person: When school ended about 3 months ago, my brother scored free tickets to our local baseball team's game that night.  His wife couldn't make it, so he asked me to come along.  He had one extra ticket that my wife agreed my youngest daughter should take.  She had never been to a baseball game before, so the kids agreed it was fair she go.  When we arrived, the kids each got a free bobblehead as a door giveaway.  They happily tapped the tops of their heads to make them bounce as we found our seats.  My daughter was a bit bored after the first few innings.  She did get very interested as the mascot made its way over to our section though.  His bright yellow fur made her eyes dazzle.  We got a nice picture of our kids with the mascot together.  After the game ended, which was quite close in score, the after show began.  Fireworks blasted bright in the sky.  They scared my daughter a little, but she was happy to see them end.  On the way home, my daughter was falling asleep in her car seat.  She sleepily mumbled that this was the best day ever."
