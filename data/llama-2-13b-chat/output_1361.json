        "Summarize the following story in first person: On Mother's Day this year I was given the greatest gift of my entire life. My step-daughter Julie and her husband took me and my husband out for lunch at a fancy little restaurant in town. I was excited to try this place out because I had never gone there before. I was so happy to be able to spend the day with my step-daughter, I hadn't seen her in a while. When we got to the restaurant we sat down and ordered drinks and appetizers. I noticed Julie and her husband kept glancing at each other during the meal, I just thought they were being silly. After the food got to the table then both put their forks down and said they had something to tell us. I was nervous because I thought something bad had happened. Julie had cancer several years ago and I always worry that it will come back. Imagine my surprise, and relief, when they told me they were expecting a baby! My first grandchild! I nearly fell out of my chair. I have always wanted a grandchild. Julie was told many years ago that she would most likely struggle with fertility as a result of her cancer treatment, so we never really expected her to be able to have a baby. This was the greatest news that anyone could have ever given me. My husband and I smiled for a week it felt like afterwards."
