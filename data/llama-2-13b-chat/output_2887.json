        "Summarize the following story in first person: So this happened about seven weeks ago and I'm still traumatized by it but I need to get it out by writing it down.  It was Sunday and for once it wasn't broiling hot outside, so Pat and I decided to get on the Harley and go for a cruise.  We weren't going anywhere special, no destination in mind, just riding in the country, taking in the scenery.  Maybe we'd stop somewhere for dinner when we got hungry or just stop off anywhere that looked interesting.  It was just a super relaxed kind of day with no responsibilities, no plans or schedules, just the wind in our faces.  We had been driving maybe two hours when the incident happened.  Out of the blue, with no warning, there was an armadillo in the road right in our path.  Like seriously, and armadillo? I didn't even know there were armadillos this far north.  I also didn't know they could move that fast, I thought they were more of a lumbering creature.  But there was no denying it was right there, almost touching my front wheel, and I had practically no time to react.  Time kind of slowed down like some kind of Matrix special effects.  I was able to consider swerving to the left and reject that idea because of oncoming traffic.  I was able to swerve right even as I cursed the loose sandy berm which I would have to go into.  I held onto the handle bars, readying myself to keep control and not go into a skid and the tires went from the hard tarmac to the gravelly sand.  Somehow I managed to keep us upright and out of the ditch.  Pat was a trooper, hanging on for dear life and leaning with me like an expert to keep from unbalancing us.  It all took a split second to happen but it felt like forever.  I pulled us back up onto the road, and we continued on our way unscathed physically, but mentally we were both deeply shaken. We haven't been out riding since.  But I'm not going to let it hold me back.  In fact I think I'll go out tomorrow."
