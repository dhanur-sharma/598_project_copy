        "Summarize the following story in first person: I haven't talk to my mother in over 3 decades. She left us when I was 4 years old, and I grew up with an abusive step mother. I always blamed my mother for it. And then a few months ago, my sister emailed me and said our mother has passed away. And I asked her how she found out and she said her husband emailed her. I told her he didn't send me anything and asked her how she died. And she said lung cancer. My mother was not a smoker. But my father was. I guess the years of living with him had it toll. he also passed away from cancer. And even though I hadn't had a contact with for a long time, it felt sad because she was my mother. It's strange how strong the biological tie really is. Is a mother one has not spoken to over in 3 decades still a mother? Of course she is. it's just biological fact. And it's also a biological fact that mothers take of their children unlike my own. But that doesn't change the fact that I had a mother. it doesn't feel like it."
