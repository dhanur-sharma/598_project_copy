        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 5 months ago I had received some bad news. It was about my son being diagnosed with a disease. Come to find out he was diagnosed with having type 1 diabetes. I had gotten the news a few months ago it hurt me to hear it. It isn't something that runs in the family my son is a first. So it may even have an impact on him years from now. It has undeniably changed our lives. we now have to do things differently in the way that we choose to live. Being that my son has diabetes we don't really eat anymore how we used to eat. we eat a lot less foods with sugars in them processed or added sugars in lunches and dinners. Sometimes it can be hard because he still can't eat certain foods at all. It makes our food very limited in what we eat. we had a short hospital stay that taught me a lot more than just basic care of the child. with type 1 diabets it taught me how to have a different perspective on life in general. I look at everything differently and react by the things I notice."
