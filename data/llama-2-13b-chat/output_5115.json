        "Summarize the following story in first person: Over the summer, I was in another state visiting family. There was a day - a Sunday - when I was planning on going home. For one reason or another, I chose not to. The next day, my mom informed me that my dog was not doing well. Immediately, I knew I had to try to get back. I don't drive and couldn't find any flights, so I opted for Greyhound. I rushed to get to the station for a very last-minute departure. While trying to board, I was denied access because my identification had expired since I left town. I was profoundly crushed. And upset at myself for letting that happen. I would make different plans to get home the next morning. However, I woke up to a text from my mom saying that my dog had not made it through the night. I barely got out of bed for days. I didn't care about going home anymore. The thought of being in my house without my dog made it feel haunted."
