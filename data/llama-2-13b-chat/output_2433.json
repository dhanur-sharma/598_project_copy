        "Summarize the following story in first person: My friend from college was a great person. She was one of the best teammates I ever had. She gave great advice and had the ability to get everyone involved without restricting anyone. A few months ago, she was diagnosed with cancer. Two weeks later, she passed away. I was in shock, as were many others. We thought she would have had an opportunity to fight the cancer, but two weeks is nowhere near enough. We held a memorial service for her. People who knew her shared about how bubbly she was. I shared how great of a teammate she was. We were all in shock, but we celebrated who she was. She made an impact toward her family, friends, and the world. It's amazing how quickly cancer affects someone's life, directly and indirectly. Moreover, most of us didn't know how grave this situation could be and was. I doubt she knew how grave her situation was. I'll dearly miss her."
