        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 7 months ago, the company I work for let us know that in the matter of two months, we would be losing our jobs. I still think about this now. It was a very tough time. I actually had a nightmare about it again last night. In my nightmare, my colleagues and I were just told and the devastation in the room was just unbearable. I still keep in touch with some of my colleagues from that job but it is not the same. The last day of work, we all came into the office with smiles on our faces but heavy hearts. that was the most memorable for me: saying goodbye to a team that I had worked with for years. This has been one of the most memorable/sad times of my life. I look upon this time as a big loss in my life. A loss of connections and relationships. A complete loss of confidence. I faced fear of being able to provide for my family in this time. It is something I do not want to face again. It is also something I will worry about facing again in the future."
