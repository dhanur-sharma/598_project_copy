        "Summarize the following story in first person: My husband and I are currently in the middle of a divorce because he refused to communicate any issues he had with me, nor did he care to fix any of the issues I brought up to him over the course of several years.  I finally got tired of it and asked for a divorce.  Unfortunately, we have two kids together and we thought it would be in their best interest if the children remained with him, so now I will see my kids far less often. I've not been happy for more than a few years now and I continually tried to bring up that I was unhappy and the exact reasons as to WHY I was unhappy he would basically tell me that he was going to change or fix it but it would never come to pass, or if he DID attempt to make it better it would only last a few days before reverting back to the exact same patterns and behaviors that made me unhappy.  He'd promised to get a job for years, but never made the effort, yet at the same time he didn't want ME to get a job either because he wanted to be the man of the house and be the provider.  I'd had that same conversation with him over and over again over the course of our marriage and that was only one reason that led to my decision to divorce him. This all finally came to a head when he asked me what we were doing.  He was upset that I had been spending more and more time in front of the computer actually attempting to work and actually making money and it was only during THIS conversation that he FINALLY raised the issues he'd been having with me.  Issues that had been going on for some time but just had never seen fit to actually tell me before then even though I would specifically ask if he had any issues with me, anything that I could change every time I tried to bring up the issue that I was unhappy and the exact reasons WHY I was unhappy.  His entire family seemed to think it a shame that I was spending more and more time in front of the computer, again actually attempting to work and bring in money, but not ONE of those people saw fit to actually say anything to me about it.  I brought up the fact that I constantly asked him if there were any issues he needed to bring to my attention after every discussion I had and he would always say no that he just wanted everyone to be happy, which I clearly wasn't.  He eventually said that he would try and start telling me things, the good and the bad, but by that point I was just done.  I'm quite sure it surprised us both when I said no and that I thought it would be best if we parted ways.  I've discovered that the most surprising thing of it all is that I don't feel upset about divorcing him, just more about not getting to see my kids as often as before. I ended up moving back in with my mom who, fortunately, only lives five minutes down the road so that I can continue to see the kids as often as I want, but it's strange not being around them constantly every day and every night and only getting to see them on the weekends as it is now."
