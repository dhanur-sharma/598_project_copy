        "Summarize the following story in first person: Dear Diary,Last week we had to take little Kyla our daughter in for surgery. I can't believe she had to have surgery so close to her first birthday.  It all started a little after she was first born, something just didn't feel right about her. But all the doctors assured me that she was fine and I was just an anxious new mother; it was so frustrating to be continuously turned away when in my heart I knew something was wrong. Finally after seeing dozens of doctors, I finally found someone who would actually listen to me and run a few test on poor little Kyla, low and behold she had a tumor on her lung that was interfering with her breathing. I felt releif, joy, and utter fear when the told me this; finally I had and answer and I was being taken seriously but this was not the answer I wanted for my 6 month old baby. The next thing out of the doctors mouth as even scarier, \"We will have to wait to do anything about it, until she is a little older and can handle the surgery better, if we go in now to remove it we could kill her on the table.\"WHAT!!!!!!!!! I felt like my world was coming down and there was nothing I could do, I am suppose to be her guardian and protector of all things and now I have to wait and sit on my hands until further notice. So for the next several months we kept going to the doctor and he would run his test to see if she was strong enough yet. The day before her 1st birthday we got the clear. She was strong enough!!!! Again so many emotions flooded through me. We already had a big birthday planned for the next day to celebrate with family and friends. I announced the next day our big news that she was strong enough now. We has such a wonderful day that day and she was showered with love and joy and prayer to keep her safe on the operating table. Then last week came and went so quickly. We arrived early in the morning and checked in. I gave my sweet beautiful girl all my love. Then we waited what seemed like hours and hours of sheer terror and boredom and hope all mixed into one bag. Noon rolled around and the nurse at the front desk encouraged us to eat something, so we did. When we came back the surgeon was also entering the waiting room looking for us. The moment I saw his face my heart sank. He came over held our hands and cried. I know at that moment she didn't make it. Now here I am in therapy and I have to write everything down in this stupid diary. I don't see how this is going to help. But hopefully it does soon because I am on the edge and close to giving in myself."
