        "Summarize the following story in first person: Dear Diary - I honestly cannot believe what just happened. I mean, what is the world coming to? I digress and probably should explain what I am even thinking. So, it started about 5 months ago. There was an incident in the parking lot of my apartment complex. A young girl was murdered and it was shocking to the entire community. The police investigated the incident and managed to find two suspects that seemed to fit the events of what happened. It seems that the suspects were also accused of murdering a 17 year old girl in the same fashion about a couple of months before this one. Everyone was at ease learning that the perpetrators have been caught. However, a few months after the incident, the suspects were released. The police did not mention why or if they had any additional leads on the situation. To say the least, our community was up in arms about it. There were complaints to the police department, detective in charge and even to the mayor! It was all very confusing. Not only that, the released suspects weren't even charged in the previous incident before this one. We are all still in a state of shock over it. We are not sure what we are going to do. People are acting a little on edge now, hoping the situation doesn't happen again. Sigh...I may think about moving. I'm not sure yet. I guess I will see how the next few months unfold."
