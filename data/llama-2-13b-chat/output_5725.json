        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last month my girlfriend and I went on a spontaneous trip to Walt Disney World located in Orlando, Florida for the weekend. This trip was extremely memorable to me because we both decided to pack a weekend bag and book plane tickets at the last minute which made the trip all that more adventurous. We ended up booking the hotel while we were at the airport and decided to stay at the Grand Floridian Resort and Spa which is on Disney Property. We were able to go to Disney Springs, Magic Kingdom, and Epcot while we were there. When we went to the Magic Kingdom I surprised my girlfriend with dinner and private viewing of the fireworks. When We went to Disney Springs we made a point to stop and eat at a restaurant called Planet Hollywood. We ordered two milkshakes and we were both surprised that the milkshakes were so large. I had an entire piece of cheesecake on top of mine while she had an entire lollypop with cotton candy and many other small delicious treats. When we went to Epcot on out final full day of visiting Walt Disney World we had the best day full of many fun memories and pictures to look back on. We tried different types of food from around the world while also getting to do a lot of shopping and buying several different cultural items. Later that night we went on the test-track which is her favorite ride offered at any of the parks so I made sure to get fast passes for it. We then decided to go to the Canada Pavilion and watch the laser and firework show. This was one of the last times the show would be running because Disney was soon going to update it. Overall, the trip was filled with excitement and fun. This is a trip I will remember for the rest of my life and I am so happy I got to spend it with my girlfriend. The day after we flew home with big smiles on our face and couldn't wait to go back."
