        "Summarize the following story in first person: Two month ago, I took my fiance on a over night trip to watch a play in Louisville. We had been dating for a bout a year and I knew that we were meant to be together. Since we have dated there have been things happen in our life that have brought us closer together. We celebrated her new job and we mourned the death of my father. After he passed it really put life in perspective and I knew that I wanted a family. I decided to visit my friend who owns a jewelry store and selected the perfect ring. It was a little over 2 carats but worth every cent. When we arrived in Louisville we checked into our hotel room and then had dinner at Jeff Ruby's Steak House. The meal was delicious and the view was even better. We decide to walk next door to the performing arts center and have a few cocktails before the show. We took our seats in a private balcony and when the first half was over the magic began. I got down on my knee and proposed to my future wife. She cried and I let a few tears slip myself. The crowd began clapping when they realized what was happening and it was the perfect moment. Now we have to plan our wedding and that may be a little more stressful."
