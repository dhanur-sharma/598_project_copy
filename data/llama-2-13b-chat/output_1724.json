I told this woman to please, go ahead. She then said, \"thank you\". I thought it was over at this point. I continued to load my groceries on the panel. The lady finishes. I thought she'd just walk out the door never to see her again. She then turns to me, hands me a $20 bill. My eyes bulge out of my head. I was shocked and excited at the same time. I get tears to my eyes because I need the money. I hug the lady and tell her thank you so much. We then part our ways. I will never forget that."
