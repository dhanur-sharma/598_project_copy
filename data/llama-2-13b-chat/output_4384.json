        "Summarize the following story in first person: About four months ago, I went on a cruise with a group of my friends that I went to college with. The trip consisted of five friends and myself. Most of us live in Florida, so we departed from Miami and had stops in Key West, Mexico and Belize before returning home. The reason we decided to do the trip was it had been 10 years since we graduated from college and went on a graduation cruise together. While taking that first trip, we made a pact to take a cruise every decade to reconnect and have fun together. Our work and personal lives have made it hard to see one another that often, but we managed to coordinate our schedules to take this trip. I roomed with one friend on the ship, while the other four had a larger cabin that they all shared with one another. Each day, we had a different activity to do. On our two days at sea, we went to the pool and the casino during the day, while enjoying some adult beverages. While we were in Key West, we walked around the town and visited local restaurants and bars. In Mexico, we were only there for a few hours due to inclement weather, but managed to do some duty-free shopping. And while we were in Belize, we got a taxi and went to a local beach and tavern to enjoy the natural beauty of that country. During the evening, we had our own table in the ship\u2019s dining room and then would go to one of the shows that the ship had and then to a bar or club onboard. There was plenty of time for all of us to reconnect with one another, reminisce about when we were younger, and have fun. On our last night, it was hard to believe how fast the trip went and how many of us won\u2019t get to see one another for a long period of time. There were a few misty eyes, but we pledged to do this trip again in 10 years and to keep better in touch with one another in the interim. Since then, we regularly text one another and share social media posts. I have been able to grab a bite to eat with two of them recently, while they were in town for the day. This trip reminds me how fast time can fly and how important it is to maintain friendships over the years. It can be hard to make the time, but it is well worth it."
