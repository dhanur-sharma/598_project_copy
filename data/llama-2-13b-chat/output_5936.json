        "Summarize the following story in first person: The day that I met but didn't really meet my current boyfriend. We were both in the same place, he noticed me hadn't noticed him, let alone noticed that he had been eyeing me trying to find out more about me any chance he got. Days later, we had our first date, he talked a lot, wasn't even nerves, just him. He impressed me though by being his true authentic self and not pretending to be anyone except himself, and I fell in love with him for it. After we left we walked around a bit and got to know each other even more. He told me about his family, friends, and what he enjoyed doing. He has a great job that he really loves and he lived alone. I remember thinking, this is great!. The way he spoke about himself was so different compared to most people in Miami. I liked the fact that he was so honest about his experiences. He really wanted to let me know who he truly was.  While we were playing golf, he was doing really great and tried showing me some pointers and tricks to do better. I still didn't get better and really wanted to learn and do better than him. Before the date, he bought me the cutest plant ever instead of flowers and I really appreciated that. I remember him telling me about his mom and the problems they both had. He was always trying to help her."
