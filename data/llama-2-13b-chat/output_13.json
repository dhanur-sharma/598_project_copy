Stared out a normal day at the library when Notice people was watching me and whispering things about me at the library. I figured at first that my looks stood out but when others who looked like me did not get the same attention and on top of that they left early to avoid attention. I quickly notice my life is endanger. I had been doing research at the library on a gang in the area and my head phones was turned up too loud where people can hear. I then left the library. I then notice I was being followed by people I did not know. They followed me to my house and if I went to the store they where there. I said to myself aint this some shit. so I started to record myself with people. The idea was very good because if I end up on a killing spree people would know the truth about what is happening. Which it comes to that point in life that I only cared about was big booty's. By the way I still like to this day. You would think I would not go to the library. lol. how stupid can I be."
