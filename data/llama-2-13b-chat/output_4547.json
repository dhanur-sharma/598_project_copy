        "Summarize the following story in first person: Last year we had a very interesting thing happening to us, to me and my son. this was something that happened around the begining of winter so that was something that made the whole event even more dramatic for us. we were walking around the neighborhood amd we saw something moving underneath a car. we were extremely courious to let it pass so we started to investigate the surroundings. we realized that the \"thing\" doing the noise was a dog. we were so intrigued about everything because it was so cold. we didnt know what to do because we have 1 dog in the house. after a long thinking process we decided to take the dog first to the vet. the doctor told us that the dog was in perfect condition leaving on a side that he was starving. we were so moved by all the things going on we wanted to stay with the dog but it was so late and we had 1 dog waiting for us.  at the end we decided to leave the dog at the vet and hoping everthing was going to be better for him. the next day first thing we did was to go to the vet and check on the dog we felt so happy that he was doing so good. he ate and he was all happy to see us. we looked at each other and it was instant we didnt even need to talk about it we wanted to keep him with us. now we live with 2 wonderfull dogs that we love dearly. we are very happy with them."
