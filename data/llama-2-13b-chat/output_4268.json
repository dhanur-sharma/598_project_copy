        "Summarize the following story in first person: While at work, I was outside on a busy street with a few of my coworkers. We were assisting with the functionality of our business when we were disturbed by a group of people screaming on the street. They seemed to be yelling in a direction together, however they were yelling at no one. We continued working and tried to down out the yelling even though it was very distracting and was interrupting our work. As the group got closer, we started to wonder if they were going to target us as bystanders. We began to collect and discuss our course of action if this group were to get hostile. They passed on the inside sidewalk of the street adjacent to our location. When they had passed we resumed work as normal. A couple minutes pass and the same group, still angry, passes by our location even closer. They seemed to be making glances in our direction and this time were more threatening. We tried to ignore them until they were closer, then proceeded to alert our manager. When the group was closing in, my manager grouped some of us together for safety purposes. The group passed us in the same disruptive manner, however they did not disturb us. Afterwards we were very on edge doing work in that location. Working under such public conditions proved to be terribly difficult."
