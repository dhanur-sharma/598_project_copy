        "Summarize the following story in first person: I lost my beloved horse, Corky very suddenly about 4 months ago. I had fed him, and he ate his breakfast just fine, and went out to eat hay with his buddy Jed. When I came back from walking my dog, he was repeatedly lying down and getting back up. I called the vet, and he came and gave him meds to ease the pain and help him feel better. He also left a couple meds with me to administer if Corky got bad again. Unfortunately, within an hour, Corky started rolling again. I gave him the meds, and had to wait an hour for the vet to return. It took what seemed like forever, while my beloved horse was dying. I sat with him while he laid on the ground, and talked to him. I kept looking at my watch. It was unbearable to see him in so much pain. The vet came, and I got Corky outside. Then the vet euthanized him immediately. In the morning, everything had been so normal, and so quickly everything changed. By evening, he had been buried, and was gone."
