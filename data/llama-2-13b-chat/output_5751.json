        "Summarize the following story in first person: 3 months ago I was only 8 months pregnant. Now I have a 3 month old.  I went into the doctor because I was having back pain. They decided to keep me overnight just to be cautious. When I woke up in the morning they told me I was in labor. I couldnt believe it. I spent the whole day in mild discomfort and after 26 hours i was ready to deliver. I was surprised to deliver a healthy baby boy at 6 lbs 1 oz. I didnt know my little man was ready to come out. My husband couldnt believe it either. We had to quick buy more baby equipment as we werent quite prepared a month out. Being a mother is hard work but overall rewarding. I am not getting a lot of sleep and feel a bit disjointed but we are doing our best. We will love our son every day of our lives. I still cant believe that his happened so early!"
