        "Summarize the following story in first person: On July 4th I gave birth to my beautiful son. It was one of the best days of my life. I went into labor early that  morning and had him in the afternoon. As soon as my water broke my husband and I headed straight to the hospital. My director came also. She met us there. The labor process was a bit painful but I got through it. My husband was alongside me every step of the way. He did a great job helping me manage my pain. I am so blessed to have given birth to a precious wonderful a amazing baby boy. He is one of the joys of my life. He gives me joy each day. The best job I could ever have is God trusting me to take care of him. I will do my best in every area and aspect. I love him do much. The doctors said I did amazing. They said I was one of their best patients in a very long time. J was so happy to hear that."
