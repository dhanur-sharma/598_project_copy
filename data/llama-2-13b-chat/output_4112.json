        "Summarize the following story in first person: We had a fun excursion last week. We had planned it ahead of time. Our son Johnny always wanted to see the movie Toy Story. He had been talking about it for months. He begged us to let him go. Having seen it before, I knew he would like it. It's a great movie. So me and my wife planned to take him to the theater last weekend. It also happened to be his birthday, so we lined up a little surprise for him. He was already excited to see the movie. We got ready and hopped in the car. We drove to the theater. We walked into the lobby and got our tickets. Little did he know, we had arranged a surprise party for him. All of his friends were there waiting for him, as well as some extended family. He was so thrilled! We also had gifts for him and rented the little party room at the theater. After the movie, we opened presents and had cake and refreshments. Everyone had a really good time. Johnny had a blast and loved the movie. He was so happy to see all of his friends, and the movie was delightful. It was maybe his best birthday event yet. A great day all around, and one that we won't soon forget."
