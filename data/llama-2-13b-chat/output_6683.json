        "Summarize the following story in first person: four months ago I went out of town from my state to north carolina. I haven't really traveled much before so I was ready to do something new. I had to get ready a little early due to me leaving straight after getting off from work. After work I stopped by the local convienant store to grab a few snacks. I always get the same things to snack on some chips, chocolate and some kind of sour candy. after getting to the airport I scanned my belonging and boarded the flight. It took a few hours to get there I went sleep almost instantly.  on the trip I discovered how different where I grew up and where this new place was. I was able to learn a bunch of new things. Like how people lived in north carolina. Also the type of places to visit like the malls they have in charolette and greensborough. It made me understand that the world is a big place and there is some much opportunity out there just waiting to be found out and grabbed. In my case I was able to find people that helped me to get a project together and started moving. It's really interesting on the type of people you meet and places. I really enjoyed being in north carolina."
