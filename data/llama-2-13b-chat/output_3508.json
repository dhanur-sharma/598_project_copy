        "Summarize the following story in first person: The event was a concert. Well we were driving to this concert. I was with a few of my friends. My spouse was home with the kids. I have always put my name in drawing for things, even though I have never won anything. Then it happened. I got a call. It was a friend of mine saying that they heard my name on the radio and I had 15 mins to call to claim my prize. I at first thought it was a prank, but i called anyway. What was the worst thing that could happen. They say i did not win? But sure enough, I was the winner. It was a 4 day 3 night free trip with airfare to Las Vegas. Both me and my spouse love Vegas. We enjoy the people watching, lights, hot weather, and gambling (even though we never win). I could not believe it. I was so excited to have won this. I even joke to my spouse that this was the greatest day of my life. I usually get the side eye from that. I am always reminded about the birth of our children, wedding, and engagement proposal. Either way it was a great night, and a great trip a few weeks later."
