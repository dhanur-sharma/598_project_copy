        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was shopping in Kroger (a local supermarket chain) with my daughter.  I had placed her car seat inside my shopping basket and we were touring the health food section. Suddenly my phone rang and an unfamiliar voice said, \u201cThis is your father\u2019s apartment manager. There\u2019s been an emergency.\u201d All I could think was that my dad had probably been taken by ambulance to the nearest hospital or something. So I asked the woman, \u201cAre they taking him to the hospital by ambulance? What hospital are they taking him to?\u201d Then the woman replied, \u201cNo, he\u2019s not going to the hospital. Your father has passed. Just try to get here as soon as you can.\u201dAll of the sudden I just felt overcome with panic. My hands were shaking as I quickly removed my daughter\u2019s car seat from the shopping basket and hurried toward the car. I was amazed at the superhuman strength I had in that moment. You don\u2019t really know what an adrenaline rush feels like until you\u2019ve either been in a life or death situation, or at least experienced what your mind considers to be the emotional equivalent. I swiftly swung my daughter\u2019s car seat in to the back seat of my SUV in a single motion. I drove with little regard for speed limit or traffic lights right to the bank down the street where my husband was working at the time.  When I finally reached the bank I swung open the double glass doors as quickly as I could. I spotted my husband sitting quietly at his desk. There were some customers waiting in the lobby, but honestly I couldn\u2019t have cared less. As soon as my husband noticed me I spoke the only words that I could think of at the time . \u201cMark! My dad\u2026 My dad died.\u201d Losing a parent is incredibly painful. Part of your identity dies. Nobody else remembers your childhood with the same sentiment. Nobody else really loves you as much as they did. It\u2019s a really difficult thing to come to terms with. It seems inconceivable that someone who\u2019s been there for us since day one can suddenly be \u2014 gone."
