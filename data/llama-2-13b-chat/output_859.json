        "Summarize the following story in first person: My soon to be sister in laws wedding. It was in one of my favorite towns, Gainsville. We each had our own little cottages on the property so I didn't feel rushed or even worried about getting ready on time since we woke up there. It was the first wedding I had ever been too as an adult, and also felt super close to the people getting married. The morning was great. I stayed with the boys for the most part since I knew them a bit better than the birdesmates. We were all swapping stories and kidding around while I helped them get ready. My boyfriend looks amazing in his tux, and it actually made me cry because I had never seen him dressed up like that. It honestly made me feel like I couldn't wait to get married for the first time ever in my life. I sat in the front and helped my boyfriends grandparents since they are a bit older and have a hard time getting up and down. The bride and groom looked so amazing. They had been together for 8 years, so this was a really big deal to everyone.  The ceremony went off without a hitch. Afterwards it was just a lot of fun. The meal was buffet style and I was sitting with my boyfriend, his parents, and his grandparents. I helped his grandparents get food, and again everyone swapped stories. I was so happy to be part of his family and part of this event, and I felt really included. At the end, we all got star-wars light-sabers and we made an archway using them for the bride and room to walk through. After that my boyfriend and I spent the rest of the night playing with the little kids who waited the whole day to play with them. We ended up getting beat up like crazy. I loved the day, and I wouldn't change it for anything."
