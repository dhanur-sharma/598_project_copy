        "Summarize the following story in first person: He ended our relationship. .He had been acting distant and cold for a couple months. My \"I love you's\" were not reciprocated. He kept saying it wasn't us. My ex-boyfriend texted me as usual. We always texted good morning. I was at home sick in bed fighting off a weird summer flu. I opened the text in hopes to find my loving boyfriend had come back to me.  No, instead he wrote, \"Please forgive me.\" I immediately knew the end had come. My heart was in my stomach. I called immediately.  I kept trying to remind him of the good times we had.He finally broke down and said he could be an \"us\" anymore. It felt like my whole world had shattered and I didn't leave bed for days. When I had enough will power, to get up, shower, eat, and go to my office, I bumped into the most gorgeous man in the elevator. I smiled and said \"good morning.\" The next day he held the elevator open and said \"Have you been to Piada ever?\". I hadn't, \"Whats that?\", I asked. He said \"Wait, and find out. Meet me here at 12.\" I was about to jump out my seat with excitement. Fast forward to the date, I was so nervous. He was the most gorgeous man I had ever seen. The food was great but, what a disaster! I spilt my whole drink and meal- spaghetti and meatballs over his suit. He laughed and I laughed and then he kissed me. I saw fireworks. He opened me to a new possibility of love and now we are going to get married."
