        "Summarize the following story in first person: My wife and I were very excited for our upcoming trip to Paris. A longtime friend of my wife was getting married to a French woman that he met in the US.  We had booked our flights and an AirBnB in advance and gotten a good deal on both. In return for a good price on our flights, they involved a couple of layovers. We thought everything would be great because we should have arrived in Paris the day before the wedding, with plenty of time to check into our AirBnB, relax for a bit, then go to the rehearsal dinner. We ran into problems on one of our layovers in Spain. We were in the Bilbao airport, eating at a Burger King, when we got notice that our flight to Paris was cancelled.  We hurried to the airline's customer service desk to see what was going on and to get a new flight. There was already a long line of angry people when we got to the service desk. We had to wait almost two hours before we had our turn and it was obvious that everyone wanted the situation to be over. The airline's customer service workers had no idea what was happening, why it was happening and they had no clear direction about how to fix the problem. They had been trying their best to reroute people to where they had to go and in our case, we had to take a 10 hour bus ride to the Barcelona airport. We crammed into the bus with about 50 other people. Once we arrived at the airport, the bus driver had no idea where to take us and generally had no idea about anything. We did about 10 laps around the perimeter of the airport, stalling and waiting for the bus driver to be told what to do. Eventually he just dropped us off at a terminal and immediately left once we were all unloaded. We went inside to find more airline employees who had no clue what was going on. They weren't expecting us, despite having 10 hours to be told that we were coming. There was another cancelled flight from another airport that they were dealing with and it look like they all wanted to slap someone and go home. We waited another 2 hours in line to get the earliest available flight to get us to Paris. The flight was at 6:30am, which by that point was just a couple hours away. We found an isolated spot in the airport to sleep and got about an hour of sleep before security woke us up and told us to move. We were able to get the flight we had scheduled this time and we got to Paris. We got to our AirBnB in time to shower, change and rush to the ceremony. We made it to the ceremony 20 minutes before it started and ended up having a blast, despite being sleep deprived zombies."
