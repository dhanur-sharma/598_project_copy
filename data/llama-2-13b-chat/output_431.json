        "Summarize the following story in first person: My daughter and her husband were excited to announce this spring that they were expecting their second child.  As a proud grandmother who provides daycare during the week for their first child Braxton, I was naturally thrilled.  My daughter is a special education teacher.  She was very fortunate to have the summer months off from teaching while she was experiencing the tiredness and nausea that early pregnancy brings.  While on a weekend camping trip at the Missouri River several weeks ago, my daughter was frightened to discover that she was passing some blood.  Her husband rushed her to the emergency room at the closest community.  They were immediately assisted by the on-call physician.  He performed an examination and lab work and called in the on-call ultrasound technician.  They were relieved to learn that she was not experiencing a miscarriage.  However, they were shocked to hear that \"BOTH\" babies appeared to be doing well and had good strong heartbeats!  What a change in emotions!  We all shifted from fear of the worst to the joy of upcoming TWINS!  We are all feeling blessed with the good news.  I am now preparing for the upcoming role as a grandma daycare provide of twin babies and a two-year-old!  Our family is so blessed with our exciting news.  We can hardly wait to learn the genders of the twins so that we can begin preparing for their arrival."
