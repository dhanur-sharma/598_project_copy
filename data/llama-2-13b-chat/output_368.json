        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was a fantastic stay.  We ate s'mores by the fire and hung out by the dock during the day.  It was so wonderful to catch up with my old friends.  Just being carefree and we felt like we were in our 20s again just for the weekend.  We all thought it would be incredible if our children would later in life go on to the same college and carry on this cycle.  On our last night there, we decided to bury a time capsule to dig up in 10 years.  Our children also placed items in the capsule and they made their own pact to stay in touch.  Even before we left, they were trading email addresses, phone numbers, and friending each other on facebook.  It was all surreal.  I wouldn't change a thing.  On our way home back to reality Sunday evening, my husband commented on how much he enjoyed meeting everyone's families.  He taught the kids how to fish and bait hooks with worms.  I was so happy we did this.  I couldn't imagine a better setting for my 40th birthday.  It is something I hope we do every year."
