        "Summarize the following story in first person: My younger brother and I are two years apart. We grew up in an environment where we played  and shared a lot of things together. we had  a lot of common friends and activities and interests. Our younger years were spent exploring our shared ideals , seeking adventure and and wonder. We were as close to each other as any two siblings can possibly be. However, when I turned 18 and moved out of state for college , our interaction became very minimal. It was time before internet, cellphones etc. Even local interstate calls were expensive. I used to visit every holiday and spend as much time doing common things, but, as time went on the intensity of activities started to slow down. Time went on , I graduated after four years and graduated college. I took a job in the same state where i finished college and settled permanently. He moved away for his job in California and our meeting and reunions became even less. Nowadays, we meet up about once a year at our parent house. Nowadays, when we meet we still reminisce on those old times and talk about our youth. It sure was the best time of my youth."
