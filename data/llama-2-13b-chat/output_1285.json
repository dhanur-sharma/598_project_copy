        "Summarize the following story in first person: On May 18th of 2019 my grandmother unexpectedly passed away. She passed away during the night. She passed away in her sleep. The official cause of death was listed as a major heart attack. My grandmother and father both lived in my own at the time this happened. Both my father and grandmother were disabled and I am their primary caregiver. This event was very traumatic to my family. My grandmother was a very influential and important part of our family. My grandmother was the matriarch of the family. The day that it happened my father knocked on my door in the morning and woke me and told me that my grandmother was gone. I immediately jumped out of bed. The paramedics has just taken her in an ambulance to the hospital while trying to resuscitate her. My father was totally devastated by this event. He was hurt and emotional and crying over the passing of his mother. I tried to do my best to console him while also handling all of the funeral expenses and requirements. We had to call and notify all of our other family members about her passing away as well. It was a very difficult and emotional experience for our family. Funerals are very expensive and there is not a lot of financial help available to people out there. I now urge everyone I know to have life insurance and a will to help simplify this process and reduce stress on the family members."
