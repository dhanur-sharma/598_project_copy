I couldn't really socialize and I had to deal with the emotional trauma of my divorce.  I didn't get to see my children as often.  I didn't get to see people that I had become friends with in my prior neighborhood.  It was just too far away from where I had moved. I had a core group of people that I could count on to hang out with on the weekends or when there was any free time.  We would barbecue together, or go out for dinners.  After I moved I met a very outgoing person.  She eventually became my girlfriend.  We started going out a lot.  She would always introduce herself and me to anyone that was out in the same location as us.  As we started going out more and more I became friends with several guys that were local.  We started going out on guys nights out and in turn I started getting out of my social shell."
