        "Summarize the following story in first person: I am the type of person who does not take loss well. I have been accused of being very competitive and a bit of sore loser. Those accusations are quite accurate. So it is with a sense of great difficulty that I write this summary in my mother-in-laws family journal. They say girls marry men like their father. After meeting John, I become a believer of that saying. He and I shared several traits. We both shared similar physical traits, tall, large builds, dark hair and eyes. We were interested in the same sports, though almost always for rival teams. A case of our geography. We had an appreciation for each others hobbies. He taught me how to enjoy fishing and I got him into woodworking. It was on a fishing trip that I first realized something may be wrong. He would be fine for several hours and then suddenly experience up to an hour of coughing fits. Fortunately we were dock fishing that day and after the second episode, I drove us back to our cabin. Right after that trip, my wife's parents sat us down to tell us about his illness. John was not the type to take things laying down. However, you could see the limitations he now had to endure were taking a toll on him. His wife, Martha, had to drive him since his coughing fits would come with times of difficulty breathing. My wife and I drove up at least once a month on weekends. Her sister and brother, living closer than us, were there more often. John would say he loved having the family around more often, though he didn't like being the center of attention. We found ourselves trying to occupy John in each of our own ways. My wife Erin and her brother Jake were psychiatrists like her dad. Though he was retired from practice he did a considerable amount of consulting for medical journals and school texts."

We all thought it was helpful and John would get a kick out of it. My wife and her sister were both very competitive with each other. So much so that they even kept score in cards and board games. John would get a kick out of their competitiveness. It was something that we all enjoyed doing together. After a few years, John's health took a turn for the worse. He was in the hospital for a week and was unable to come home. We all visited him every day and kept him company. When he was finally released, we were all overjoyed. Though he still had the coughing fits, he seemed to have more energy and was able to do more for himself. He was still limited, but he was home. After that, we all decided to make the most of our time together. We spent as much time as we could with John and tried to do things he enjoyed. We were all very grateful for the time we had with him and for each other. I am grateful for my wife and her family for helping me through this difficult time."
