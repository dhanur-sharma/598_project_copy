        "Summarize the following story in first person: Earlier this year, about four months ago, I bought my first house. It was an exciting occasion to be the proud owner of my own house. It was not easy though because it took a long time and a lot of hard work to make this a reality. It first started when my financial planner so many years ago told me that I should invest in owning my own home. He set out a 7 year plan for it. I told him that I wanted to make it on my own savings without credit or a loan. He decided to tell me that it would not be easy but it was possible. I sold the idea to my wife and she bought it. But she had misgivings because that meant we would have to make lots of sacrifices like doing away with our yearly vacations. I must say that she was a great help to me. There were times that I felt like giving up, for example, when our daughter was sick and she had to be operated on. There were times when I thought I could not make it because it was having a toll on me psychologically. Yet, I kept on with the plan and successfully scaled one milestone after the other. I must say that it is not easy to own a house. I do not envy homeowners and now that I am one, I understand what it means. But owning a house is part of the story. I have to make plans towards maintaining it. I have that in my plans. But right now, I am very happy."
