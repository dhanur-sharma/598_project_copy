        "Summarize the following story in first person: I have been working as an engineer at the IT firm I've been working at since 2015. I like my job, and it pay well for what I do and my workload. However, I have had this feeling in my gut that I can be doing more. So when I can across a flyer in the office for an open position for a team leader 12 weeks ago, it peaked my interest. I thought about the new levels of stress and responsibility I would have to deal with if I got the position, but I also thought about all the new projects I can be involved in and the work I can help shape. So I ultimately decided to take a chance an applied for the position. About a week after I sent in my application, I got a call from my supervisor. He told me that if I was sure about taking this position? He said he's asking because this role is known to have a high turn over rate. To be honest, I felt like he was just trying to scare me away from the job, so I told him I was serious about the job. He then said the interview for the position starts a week from that day, and I am the first one up to be interview out of a total of 15 applicants. I spent the next week practicing my answer and pitch. I made sure to remember all my accomplishments and the best way to convey them during the interview. By the day of the interview, I felt that I was ready. The interview was more intense that I expected. The questions were pointed and the complexity of the questions were high. I absolutely believe I would have bombed the interview if I didn't spend every waking moment I wasn't working or sleeping practicing my answers and my delivery. The interview lasted for about a half hour, and I was told we candidate would get an answer on who got the position in 72 hours. Two days later, I was called into my supervisor's office and was told I got the job."
