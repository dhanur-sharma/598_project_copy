        "Summarize the following story in first person: I had a friend here who lived closed to me and we grew up together , we also went to high school together. So we were always in contact with each other. One day he decided that he is going to leave for a vacation for couple of weeks, and I kept seeing instagram pictures of him during his vacation. So later met a girl and he decided to stay over there in Europe. We were messaging each other , and about a year ago , he stopped calling or messaging me back, so I heard he is in serious relationship with this person, so thats fine, im like he will message me when he does have time. Later 3-4 months go by, I didn't hear nothing from him, I did hear from his family that he is doing ok. So now its been a year and still nothing from him I didnt hear. Upon 2 weeks ago, he showed up at my door, and I was really suprised and shocked. Also kinda dissapointed. But in the end I am glad he is back, because it was very weird not seeing him or talking to him like we used to. It was very strange I have to say.  Was I surprised ? Yes. I am happy about it? Alsolutely. This is probablly going to be one of the few days I will remember."
