        "Summarize the following story in first person: I wrote a story about my daughter leaving for a leadership camp.  I wrote that it was significant for her, because it was a reminder that she is growing up.  I wrote that it was significant for me - because it has always been the two of us.  When she was younger, we used to walk the dog after dark and swing our arms and call ourselves 'the girls.'  That's a plural sobriquet - for two very distinct individuals.  I don't remember if I wrote that I was surprised by my own sense of loneliness.  Nor do I remember if I wrote that I was at all hopeful.  But emotions are palpable, now - but only in the corners of the day.  Leaving her at camp felt very wounding - as though a part of me was also gone.  Thinking about it, now, I can still feel the echos of those feelings.  But, of course, you are asking at the end of Summer and school is about to start next week.  We are hurrying though the days, finding new clothes, new books, and making last minute arrangements of her junior year.  So, my story of pain really is only experienced at the end of the day - when we are both ensconced in our rooms - alone.  I do know that I must have written that this was an opportunity for me to practice saying goodbye.  I am reminded of that in those quiet moments, and I think about it often.  What will my mission be - when my day to day existence is not defined by my parenting?I have no idea what I might have said was the most surprising part of the story.  I know I did not write that I was surprised at her ability to fit in at the camp, though I was surprised.  I am certain that I did not write that I was surprised that she decided to study poetry at the camp - though this was a clear surprise.  I love poetry - so, her choice was a kind of acknowledgement of me as well as a newfound interest, in her. I am certain that I did acknowledge that the next two years have to be about me finding my own path again.  A more independent one.  And I remember how surprised I was that she kept calling and texting.  It was a more adult interaction - but she still needed me and that was reifying.  Here at the house - or daily when she is about her routines, she never calls me or emails or texts.  So, her nightly reminders that she needed me were both reassuring, surprising, and comforting."

I remember the nights when I did not sleep at all.  The nights when I cried - because she was not in the bed next to me.  I remember the nights when I was so exhausted - that I could not even read a book.  I remember the nights when I felt lost and alone - without her by my side.  I remember the nights when I felt a deep sadness and emptiness - because she was not here.  I remember the nights when I felt like a ship without a rudder - drifting and lost at sea.  I remember the nights when I felt like a tree without roots - uprooted and tossed about by the wind.  I remember the nights when I felt like a bird without wings - unable to fly or soar.  I remember the nights when I felt like a fish without water - gasping for air and unable to breathe.  I remember the nights when I felt like a flower without sun - wilted and dying.  I remember the night"
