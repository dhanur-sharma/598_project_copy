        "Summarize the following story in first person: I went to celebrate my 4th of July celebration at my parent's home. This one probably one of the more memorable 4th of July celebration that I can recall. When I arrived I was surprised with joy and definitely pure happiness when I saw my mom. She flaunted her dentures to me and I was very happy for her, and at the same time wanted to joke about her new dentures because she looked so different, but in a good way. I went to the back and saw my dad cooking the meat already. I asked my dad if I could help prepare some of the meat to barbecue but he insisted that he did not need any help. I went back to my mom to ask if I could help out more, luckily my mom actually needed my help. I love helping around when there is an event, especially to my parents. I tried rearranging the seat arrangement that my mom tried to do because everything was more cluttered and feels awkward for guests. Later that day my brother arrived. He was more in charge with the fireworks so I was definitely excited with that. Him and I are very psyched about fireworks/firecrackers even back then when we were so young. The night was almost over and the fireworks that my brother brought was more unique than usual, it was a lot more brighter and has more pop to them when they went up to the sky. I still laugh at how my mom looked differently with her dentures even after a few days, maybe I just missed her that much. It was just one of those days that you cant stop being grateful for the family around you."
