        "Summarize the following story in first person: About three months ago I had applied for a promotional opportunity at work. I did not really think that I had a chance to get the job, but I ended up applying anyway. I was temporarily upgraded to the job but it was not a permanent upgrade so I had to apply still. I ended up getting an interview so I went to it. I was very nervous, but I took a few deep breaths when I got there and gathered my confidence and did pretty good. In the end, I did get the job. This new job would be a pretty significant increase in pay, it would also require me to commute to a new workplace. I was apprehensive about the new job and new workplace. I was not sure how well the new group of people would perceive or like me but I had no choice but to show up and get started. I have a supervisory role so it was a bit of an adjustment. It took awhile for me to get used to people expecting me to make the decisions on what they should be doing at work. People were calling me boss man and it felt very awkward. However, as time goes by it has become a good feeling to be counted on and relied upon. You have the ability to make a large impact in many different situation for your employer and employees. I am trying my best to succeed and to do a good job. Overall I am enjoying this role."
