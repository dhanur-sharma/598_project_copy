        "Summarize the following story in first person: My mother is an 80 year-old widow. Late last year, after years of dealing with her dementia-ridden husband, she put him in a care home. Then in March of this year he passed away. During her time caring for him, her mental and physical health seemed to suffer. After she put him in the home, she did better. It was a bit of a relief when he passed away, and I hoped she would improve. That didn\u2019t seem to be happening. One day I couldn\u2019t get a hold of her all day, and I feared the worst. It turned out she was fine but had accidentally turned off her cell phone. At that point I realized that I needed to move in with her. She needed someone to help her out a bit, and I needed the peace of mind of being with her. So within the span of a few days I decided to move in with her and then did. It was a difficult thing to do for me. I had lived by myself for over fifteen years. I wasn\u2019t used to living with someone else. On top of that, there were the ego-related feelings of being a pathetic adult living with his mother. I knew it was for the best for my mother, so I just had to deal with the negative aspects of the situation. She thinks its great and perfectly natural, while I think it\u2019s a necessity and unnatural.  It has been two months now and it is going reasonably well. My friends all understand and even encouraged me to move in with her. I still feel weird about it and I still miss my independence. But I do not miss the constant worrying about her and what she is up to. I\u2019m doing what I need to be doing right now. There should be plenty of time for me to live on my own again sometime in the future."
