        "Summarize the following story in first person: I remember how cool it was to go inside for the first time and see alot of people dressed up. I know that I felt that I was part of something more and among people who were just like me. I was also happy to just be there with my loved ones and it was my nephews first time at a convention so it was really exciting. I was really happy when I got to meet some comic people who wrote on my favorite book Harley Quinn. Jimmy and Amanda Conner were some of the coolest people that I met that day. I got to tell them how much their comic meant to me and got to thank them for doing the great work that they did. I felt that they were really humbled people and it was so exciting to meet them for the first time. My girlfriend who is my wife now got to meet spike from buffy and she was happy about that and it was a good moment because of how kind the person was to everyone. We also got to get alot of cool items that we had not gotten before from other places so I felt we got alot of unique stuff ourselves.  But the one part of the convention that was a high light was getting to Meet Kevin Conroy. The line itself was really long and some of the people who were waiting were kind of rude especially one guy that made kevin take a picture of himself and was just pretty silly and embarrassing in the end. But I was just glad and happy I got to meet one of my idols growing up and just meeting them for a few minutes was just one of the highlights and moments that I would hold for myself. I had a great time and felt that because I was with my peers that I was able to enjoy it more. It was also more fun because of my family that went with me. I know that my nephew loved it and I got to spend time with him. I got to spend time with my girlfriend and grow our relationship more too."
