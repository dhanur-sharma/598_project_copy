        "Summarize the following story in first person: I just attended my 50th High School Reunion.   I was able to reconnect with past classmates from over 50 years ago.  This was due to alot of my classmates also attended my grade school.  So, I was remembering some of them from over 60 years.  The memories that were relived by each of us had us laughing and crying.  I was grateful for the time I was able to see my old friends.  For a while, I was reluctant to attend this event.  This is because my best friend had died a few years prior.  She and I had attended our 20th reunion together.  In high school, we were inseparable.  Wherever she was, I was right there along with her.  At this reunion, they had a table set up with votive candles and cards in front of each one stating the classmate's name and the date of their death.  It was very emotional for me to see so many names of classmates I knew and missed.  At my table was my neighborhood girlfriend,  who lived down the street from me growing up.  She and her husband had moved out of state, as I and my husband did.  Out of our 367 graduates, 93 have passed away that we know of.  We had 75 graduates attend this reunion.  Not bad for 50 years.  It was a night I will long remember.  I am definitely glad that I attended."
