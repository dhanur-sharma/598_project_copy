        "Summarize the following story in first person: My niece and nephew were over after school as they usually are every, Friday. They're usually pretty hungry after a long day at school and so my mother and I took them to grab a quick bite. As we headed off, I felt a bump under a rear tire but thought nothing of it since we live on a dirt road there are alway a bunch of rocks shifting from day to day. Once we got all of their food we headed back so they could eat more comfortably at home. We headed back home, just another Friday with the kids. It seemed that way until we got to the driveway and that bump had been more than just a rock. I had run over my cat, Patches on the way out, not a rock. I didn't want to startle the kids so I kept driving and helped bring the kids inside so they would hopefully be occupied inside eating. I felt so guilty for what I had done. I know it was an accident, I know but I had a direct hand in her death. I didn't know what to do at first but I knew I couldn't just leave her there. As I moved her out of the road, the kids wandered outside to see what I was doing. They asked me what happened to my cat and so I explained to them what I had done and how much, Patches meant to me. I told them that I had her as a kitten before either of them were even born. I didn't expect either of them to try and comfort me but somehow they just knew what do in that very moment. They told me that accidents happen and that it was going to be okay. To say I was surprised is and understatement. This is one of the many reasons that I love those little guys."
