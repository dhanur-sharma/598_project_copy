The days seem to drag on, Carl didn't seem to have much purpose anymore. Then the neighbor girl Samantha asked us if wed like to adopt a cat a few days ago. I didn't think it was the best idea at first, but Carl wanted to. He made up a bed for her and got all of the supplies we needed. Hes so loving and caring. It reminds me of why I married him and the family we built together. Its hard to still feel like a family these days but I think we'll be okay now. We named the cat Turk. She lays next to him while he watches TV. I've never seem a cat follow a man around so much. Shes also laid in bed with me while I read. Shes brought so much comfort into our home. It feels like a home again."
