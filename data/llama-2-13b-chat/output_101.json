        "Summarize the following story in first person: As a high school student, I see so many different students living so many different lives. I see so much sadness from people with so much potential, and so much goodness. Overtime, I realized that a lot of this comes from a lack of self-love and self-confidence. I began watching endless ted talks about confidence, openness, and outreach. From this I have created a montra for myself that defines how I live. \u201cBe so confident and so grounded in yourself, that you are able to love others regardless of division, jealously, or judgement.\u201d I try to live by these words every day. To be proud of who I am, and what I have to offer the world. And by becoming confident in my life, I am able to inspire confidence in others. I am able to show others their potential and goodness regardless of how different they are than me. I am able to be genuinely happy and proud of others when they do better than me. I am able to reach out to others regardless if others will judge me for doing so. Confidence in myself has inspired me to be a better person, to live a better life, and to make the world a better place. you want to be happy and successful person, it is so important to keep believing in yourself and stay self-confident. What you need for this? Just be faithful to yourself and your own values, always do your best and don't try to avoid mistakes, as we can learn more from our failures then from our achievements. The Dalai Lama says \u201cSelf-confidence is knowing that you have the capacity to do something and deciding not to give up.\u201d so trust your self first. Two main things contribute to self-confidence: self-efficacy and self-esteem. We gain a sense of self-efficacy when we see ourselves"
