        "Summarize the following story in first person: I find myself pondering more and more about a bizarre event that happened to me about 2 months ago. The time for my graduate studies finals was fast approaching and I had been wracking my brain over all of the content that I had to master within the next two weeks. The stress was growing more and more overwhelming with each passing hour. It eventually got to the point where I started facing a bout of insomnia. No matter what I tried, I could not bring myself to fall asleep. This grew more problematic after several days of being unable to drift of into sleep. I was having difficulty commuting to class and paying attention to what the professors were saying. After several days, I began to find it difficult to distinguish between what was reality and what was illusion; a common symptom of insomnia. The most unsettling perception I encountered was a group of children unknown to me. They were playing together in a field within a park. As they ran around, they began to extend their hands toward a nearby playground. I could see some kind energy emanating from their fingers. Almost instantly after this began, the metal implements on the playground began to move on their own. Some tore out of the ground and began to whirl around in mid air. The children were creating their own magnetic waves and were thus able to manipulate metal around them. It reminded me of the character Magneto from the X-Men comics, though the children did not appear to have any malevolent intent. When I finally snapped out of this vision, I was honestly uncertain about whether or not what I had seen was real. Sleep deprivation had obviously gotten the better of me. It wasn't until my finals were over that I was finally able to get some sleep. Having had time to rest and put finals behind me, the perceptions from this experience have begun to coalesce in my consciousness and I find myself needing to figure out what the experience meant."
