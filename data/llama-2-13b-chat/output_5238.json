        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was recently promoted at my job. I'm rather young and was hired at the company less than a year ago fresh out of college. This was the exact type of job that I was wanting to get into and I really think I can have a career here. It is a corporate job at a very large firm, so I am very happy being with the company. So far I have received nothing but commemoration and positive feedback on my work. This is despite that fact that I really don't find it hard and have quite a bit of downtime to relax on my phone and browse the internet. I honestly find most of the work to be easy and it comes naturally to me. I've gotten great feedback from my leadership team as well, so I really think I will be able to excel in this position and get a very high position in the future. I'm very excited about the opportunity and I think I will be able to be a millionaire from working here. My promotion was to a senior level position and I think I can lead a team of analysts in the near future. I also think I can take my skills and abilities from this job to other large companies. At such a young age I am very excited about how my career is progressing. My peers are not progressing as fast as I am and I try to be very humble when talking about the promotion. I may be managing these people in the future, so I try to keep a very good working relationship with them. Overall, I am very happy with where I am at in life and I think I have quite a few options in the future for where I end up."
