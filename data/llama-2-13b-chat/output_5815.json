        "Summarize the following story in first person: My friend and I took off of work at the same time to take a trip to Western Europe. Neither one of us had a lot of money saved up, but we were determined to go on the trip together. We decided that we were going to stay in hostels with others to save some money. We also went to cheap museums to learn about the local culture of the areas we visited. I knew that I wanted to do more than just go to museums, so we looked up other free things to do. We decided to go to a local beach one day since it was the summer to swim in the water and sunbathe. We also found a couple free parks to hike where we saw some beautiful scenery and animals. The most important thing for me was tasting the local cuisine, so we ate out almost every meal. We found the best rated restaurants and eateries within our budget and went to a different place each time. We even spent a couple nights camping in the wilderness to save even more money during our trip. One of the last things we did was went to local shops to find local souvenirs to purchase. We didn't want to risk losing them throughout our travels or have it stolen, so we waited until the evening before we left. I bought a couple shirts, jewelry, and a keychain. My friend bought similar things as well, plus some extra things for her younger siblings back home. We both had a fun trip and didn't spent more than we had planned on. We both would like to take another similar trip together at some point in the future."
