What better way to explore the hills than a mountain bike, right? I have been searching for one for a while now. Doing my own research on them. I have been feeling unsure about getting one though. What if it turns out to be disappointing? Had my doubts. However, i am so glad that i decided to get one anyways. It far surpasses my expectations for it. Its performance is top notch. It rides so smooth and easy through these hills. I am fully satisfied. I am riding my bike daily now for sure."
