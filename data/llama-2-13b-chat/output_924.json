        "Summarize the following story in first person: A few months ago my husband and I took a quick trip to Walt Disney World together.  It is my favorite place to visit because it reminds me of being a kid. I was really excited to arrive and I couldn't wait to do all the parks together. I was a little disappointed that we weren't staying longer and that we were just making it a weekend trip. I was looking forward to spending quality time with my husband, just he and I, without the kids. We never get to spend time alone together, so this was going to be fun. The most memorable part of the trip and the most surprising for me was when we were in Mexico, in Epcot and my husband ordered a margarita. When it came up it looked like there was an ant floating in it. He said to the server that there was an ant in it and she said there was supposed to be. It was a special type of mexican margarita with \"ant salt\" and the whole rim of the glass was actually salted with crushed up ants. I was really surprised that they sold drinks like that, but even more surprised when my husband ended up drinking the entire thing and ordering a second one. He asked me if I wanted to try it, but I passed. We laughed about it and I know that it is something that I will never forget. It is burned into my memory. Although it was super hot and humid the whole time we were there because it was at the height of summer, I still had a wonderful time. I can't wait to do it again soon."
