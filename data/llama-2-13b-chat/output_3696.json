        "Summarize the following story in first person: Why can't people just leave me alone, why is it hard for people to understand it when you need your space. What happened today had nothing to do with race or anything, any one around their could see i was engrossed and really busy on my phone. On this particular i was way behind scheduled on so many office assignments and i had to find a way to cover up.  I have been working my ass out lately at the office because i volunteered to cover up for a friend who had to go his girlfriend and Miami. their relationship was on the verge of collapse, so i had take one for the team. Unfortunately for me our boss told me a delegation from the headquarters where coming the following week, we had to put things in order and owing to the fact that my colleague travelled i had to cover up for him and at the same try and tidy up files for both of us. This  wasn't what i expected but lo and behold it is happening. So after a very stressful morning i went for a lunch break as didn't have breakfast that day, made and order for some food which i can't even remember presently and I was trying to get some things done on my phone before while my order was been prepared. I looked and saw a Mexican looking man in a green shirt in front of me, went back to what i was doing on my phone almost immediately. I noticed him mumbling something but i was too engrossed to pick out the words. The next thing i knew was him ranting at me claiming i wasn't talking to him because he Mexican and calling a racist. Now please tell me how does sitting in a restaurant and waiting for your order to arrive make me a racist. I had to call security on his ass for me to have some peace, that was when i noticed my order had already been brought to my table. I think people should learn to mind their business and leave people alone when they are not in the mood to talk. I had to go for 15 minutes walk before i could go back to my work. He basically made me waste 15 extra minutes of my precious time. The good thing is that i was able to finish all i needed to do in due time"
