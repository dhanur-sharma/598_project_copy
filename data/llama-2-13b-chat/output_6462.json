        "Summarize the following story in first person: About half a year ago, I was really struggling because I am living on my own and I have to pay all of the bills by myself. I was really short on money and I did not know what to do. I no longer had a car to go to work with. Taxis cost me $24 to get there and back, so it was not worth taking them. Public transportation was also a really big hassle. I decided that I would walk to work and back every single day. I picked up a lot of overtime hours and ate some really cheap food as well in the meantime. I finally had some money saved up to even start looking for potential suitable used cars. I asked my stepfather to help me look for the best possible car that would just get me to work and back, but nothing special was even necessary for me. He had agreed to help me look. He called me back and told me that he had found a car, but I would have to ask my brother to take me to his house so we could all go and see the car together. Once we got there, I really liked the car, but I was short on money. My stepfather told me right then and there that he was paying it in full because he had seen how hard I was working to succeed in life. I got very emotional and thanked him several times over. He even paid for the license plate and the initial insurance payments. That was the nicest thing that anyone has ever done for me. It made me decide to be a better person and to give back whenever I was in a better position."
