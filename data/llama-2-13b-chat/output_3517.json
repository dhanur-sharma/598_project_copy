        "Summarize the following story in first person: I loved that trip with my turtle. He was so cute. He did struggle in his cage but that's okay. Once we landed I let him out to run around. He was so happy to get off. THe first thing he did was run around and lay in the grass in the sun. He was so cute. I love my turtle so much. He did meet this one kid who wanted to hold him. I asked his parents if it was okay and they said yes. So I let him hold him but then he dropped him. He dropped my baby turtle on the floor of that filthy airplane. I was so upset. Once we got to the hotel I gave him a bath immediately. He got so clean after that. I was so mad at that little brat. I don't know how brain dead you can be to drop a turtle but that was infuriating. That is the last time I let a kid touch my pet turtle."
