        "Summarize the following story in first person: I recall this one time I went to a local store/small discount type place with my mother several years back in to my further youth. I remember back then that I used to go to a lot of places back when there was a nearby mall to which I lived with my mother beside, able to simply walk to and buy stuff of need with out a car being required or such. I remember one day that -- as we were browsing through a discount store/dollar store type place -- this old-looking women of particular interest was spotted by me. I mean she wasn't of \"interest\" in the sense of dating or etc., but in that she had some sort of essence to her presence -- or like something unusual about her that stuck out. The old woman had on an interesting set of clothing, but other than this her overall being had some sort of peculiar effect -- maybe even something like that of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu or such. It was basically like this woman had some specific intrigue or stood out for some reason -- even to the degree of an enchanted-like embodiment to her. Others did not seem to notice her much, but I do remember feeling some affinity to her in that she kind of seemed to be there for some reason -- almost like it was directed to me. I didn't approach her or anything, but definitely did notice her repeatedly and felt as if there was something special about her. Eventually I just continued to browse as my mother looked through stuff (I was maybe 13 or 14 then -- not sure really but something around those years) until we were about to pay. My mother went to go pay or wait in line, and I just walked off to browse/kill time I suppose. As I walked off I ran in to this woman unexpectedly (meaning I didn't deliberately look for her or such) and was sort of in her near vicinity/personal space. Immediately there was no verbal contact, but she soon after did begin talking to me. I don't remember what we talked about, but she did engage and start a conversation that lasted at least a few minutes. If I can roughly recall, the whole situation/circumstance felt unreal in a way -- like again confirming the enchanted-like tone of the woman and her appearance and just essence overall. I never expected to begin talking with her or such, but basically it happened and confirmed my initial hunch of the woman having some interesting qualities or such about her. The conversation didn't last long and the duration wasn't of interest, but the whole set of coincidences and feelings pretty much being sealed together with the talk, which went well of course. I didn't continue to speak or converse with her -- more so she just naturally led the conversation on and everything just sort of \"went perfectly\" in the exchange before eventually it led to a natural ending with my mother finishing paying and me meeting back up with her to leave the store. I did remember this particular exchange for time after as something unique/particularly special in some unexplainable way, but not very vividly for long."
