        "Summarize the following story in first person: Two weeks ago, I was fortunate to be attending my 20 year old son's \"White Coat\" Ceremony for his acceptance to Pharmacy School. His older brother has already been in Pharmacy school for the past two years and his younger brother was wanting to join him. For me as a parent, I was super excited and happy for my son. He has had some challenges getting to this point, some were academic and some were personal. His mom did not have the confidence that he would get in, and I did not waiver in my belief that he would make it in. Samuel (20 year old) is a very hard worker, but at times can be lazy. He initially started his college career at the main University and was struggling. I convinced him to start his schooling at the local community college to help with the transition. He objected at first, he thought it would look like he failed, but it turned out to be the best decision that he made. He met a professor there that inspired his passion for the Pharmacy school. I really think his path via community college helped shape his direction into getting accepted to Pharmacy school. His older brother (Albert) also played a huge role in helping and support. I was very emotional knowing that the two brothers were working together and that Albert was excited to see Samuel with him at school. I was a proud parent that day, and as a family we felt very fortunate,  the best thing to come out of the experience was the example to my youngest son (Jacob) who is eleven. He wants to pursue a career in the medical field as well."
