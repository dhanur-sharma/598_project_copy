        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 3 months ago I was in California working on a project for a new building. It was going to be the project that sent me into mega bucks. I am sitting at my desk staring at a blank screen because my ideas had ran out for new buildings weeks ago and I was drawing a blank. My cell rings and it's my mother. I can't stand her but I need the break so I answer. She tells me my grandfather has passed away and I need to come home. I clearly couldn't leave in the middle of this project. It was my job or my grandfathers funeral. I wanted to tell that boss where to shove it, but I stayed. It was the worst decision I have ever made. Yes, I kept my job, but at what cost. My family refuses to talk to me. My grandfather is dead. I am here alone with my money. I want to kill myself."
