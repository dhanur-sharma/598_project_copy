I kept asking for more responsibility. I like the work; there just ended up being too much of it. I saw the Fourth of July coming up and had every intention of sleeping right through it. I was going to spend four days on my couch doing absolutely nothing. My buddy wouldn't let that happen. His family has a house on the beach and he insisted that I go with him. He knew how stressed I was. It was just what I needed. I essentially did what I planned to do at home. I slept a lot. I drank beer. I ate too much. But I did it surrounded by friends and on the beach. I returned to work recharged and ready for more."
