        "Summarize the following story in first person: At the end of August I went on a girls trip with my sister and best friend.  We went to Sedona, Arizona and stayed for four nights.  We planned the trip 6 months in advance and we were super excited about going.  We wanted to go hike in the Arizona mountains because we all love to hike.  We were all responsible for researching trails or places that we wanted to visit while we were there.   We hiked at Bell Rock and heard people playing the bagpipes while we were standing at the top of the rock.  It was awesome.  We drove to the Grand Canyon to watch the sunrise with complete strangers and it was amazing.  We slide down the rocks at Slide Rock State Park which was hands-down my favorite place of the trip and possibly any place I've ever been.  We went on an 8 mile hike in the Coconino National Forest just to say we hiked it.  The trip was extremely fast but we also took time to relax and enjoy the Arizona weather and beautiful scenery.  I was happy that it was a girls trip, but I was also sad that my husband and kids weren't with me.  My kids especially would have enjoyed Arizona, in particular Slide Rock State Park.  I could picture them having a blast there and I hope to take them one day.  We enjoyed our time immensely and it will forever be a favorite place to visit.  Sedona is beautiful and I really felt like I connected with the environment and was at peace."
