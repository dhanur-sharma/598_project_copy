        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was in a music duo. My partner is significantly younger than I am, and part of the reason why I did so much for the group was to give her a good foundation for her future. (Mine is much more limited.) We were together about a year and half when for various reasons we decided to part. However, we wanted to fulfill the few shows left. I began to wonder what I'd do with my free time, and I was a little worried she didn't have an avenue to continue being a musician. But at our second to last performance, someone in the crowd requested one of her original songs. I didn't know how to play it, so I left the stage. She played herself and had the audience entranced with her song. Meanwhile, I began to chat with members from a band I like quite a lot. Out of the blue they asked if I'd join. They had no idea the duo was splitting. It was just a coincidence. So, in an instant, I realized she'd be fine and that I had a new opportunity. I was proud of her for being good enough to stand on her own two feet, and I was enormously proud to be asked to join a group I admire. All of this came about because we worked hard during our time together, so the feeling it was all \"worth it\" in some way was strong as well."
