        "Summarize the following story in first person: I broke up with my girlfriend, it was a very emotionally trying time for me. We've been dating for over 2 years but somethings have not been adding up recently and i feel there is a need for us to go our separate ways. This decision was mutual and would be mutually benefiting. I know it's going to be hard to get over it but i know i'll survive.  I have for about 6 months now noticed a sudden change of behavior, everything we shared and enjoyed together all of a sudden doesn't make sense to her anymore. She now complains about almost everything, on days when i call regularly she complains of me disturbing her. On days when i'm too busy to call however she says i'm not been caring enough. I later found out she was seeing another person who happened to be someone i knew and they were both trying to hide the relationship from me. It was had pill to swallow but life most go on. What i'm still trying to wrap my head around is why she didn't just break up instead of the torments she was putting me through. She basically sits around all day doing nothing, she resigned from work about 5 months ago and i've been responsible for most of the stuffs we both need and i still get cheated and insulted, i don't know what i've done to deserve this but i know their sweeter things laying in future for me. I don't know how long this would take to heal but i know it will someday. I am seriously not considering dating anyone in the nearest future. I'm presently trying to enroll at a near by culinary school, I have had to stop myself from doing so many things, just so I'll have enough time to be with her. Now i want to start chasing all those dreams i had halted for love. I wish i hadn't started the relationship in the first place."
