        "Summarize the following story in first person: About two weeks ago my husband and I decided to plan a beautiful trip. We recently had children and we have been so busy raising them that we have not been able to spend much time together. After having a long talk about what kind of vacation we deserve we came up with the location of Las Vegas. We thought Las Vegas would be perfect because its close to home and it's a place were we can enjoy ourselves. While being in Vegas we visited many places and enjoyed great company with each other. We stayed about 4 nights in a classy hotel and got room service for the last day of our trip. That day my husband left to go get somethings and told me to get ready on the last day. When he came back we had a very classy dinner and had great conversations. My husband and I have been together about 11 Years now. My husband then kneeled down and proposed to me again! It was the most adorable thing ever, I felt so in love again. We are going to be renewing our vows with our whole family there. The most beautiful part is that i am able to have our children see us get remarried and be a part of our love.  Within the next year we will be having a ceremony and we are so excited. We are so happy that we took the time to tend to ourselves. We both deserved this vacation and it brought us closer in our relationship. Thats what I believe a vacation is to be able to release the negative energy that is built up and come back new loving beings."
