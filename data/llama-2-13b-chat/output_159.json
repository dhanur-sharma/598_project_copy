        "Summarize the following story in first person: I got a promotion at work! It all seemed to be a normal day when a client came in with a problem. I figured I would help them out as if I'd help anyone else. It turned out to be not an average problem. It took me longer than normal for this client, but it was worth it in the end. The client had a problem that would effect a ton of people. I actually had to be in top form to get it done. When done I was thanked and it seemed like this person actually cared that I was able to help them out. My IT team noticed how hard I'd been working lately. They also noticed the extra amount of attention and effort I put into this client. So they promoted me within the team because of it! The people I worked with daily got to have a great day out. We even got an awesome lunch out of it! I also now have some perks that I didn't have before the promotion. Just goes to show if you keep at it and go the extra miles sometimes, sometimes good things happen. Much love out to you all!"
