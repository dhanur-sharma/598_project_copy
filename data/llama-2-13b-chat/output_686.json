        "Summarize the following story in first person: I recently found out that one of my best friends was badmouthing me to my fiancee because he had a thing for her. He was telling her all sorts of lies to sway her into thinking I'm a bad guy in effort to win her over. Fortunately, she told me and I was really mad because I was being betrayed by someone I trusted. I forgave him in my heart but I can't be friends with him anymore. I just can't bring myself to trusting him and considering him my friend anymore. What's sad is that he's put my life out of balance now because I don't trust anyone anymore because of that betrayal. When this best friend of mine betrayed me and badmouthed me to my fiancee, she told me and I was really mad because I was being betrayed by someone I trusted. I forgave him in my heart but I can't be friends with him anymore. I just can't bring myself to trusting him and considering him my friend anymore. What's sad is that he's put my life out of balance now because I don't trust anyone anymore because of that betrayal. That being said, I was happy that my fiancee trusted me enough to alert me about it and get my side before believing anything that friend was telling her. I appreciate her now more than ever and know that whatever life throws at us we'll get through it if we trust each other enough to communicate about everything, good or bad. Communication is key to any relationship. The fact that my fiancee decided to tell me the truth strengthened our relationship even more. It proved that we can go through hardships and as long as we talk about it, we can escape them without any damage."
