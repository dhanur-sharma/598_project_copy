        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was a rainy night and I was out getting drinks. I was alone and feeling lonely. I bought a few drinks, and after feeling a bit tipsy went out to walk around. While it was raining I stood up against a wall and just stood there. A woman comes up and we start talking. While talking we joke about life and we both find out that we're both a bit tipsy. After awhile she wants me to help her home and I agree. While walking home she almost walks into traffic and I pull her back. She is scared and I hold her for a moment in the rain. She starts to cry and I tell her everything is okay. She thanks me and says \"You're my guardian angel\". We manage to get back to her place and before I leave she ask me for my name because she forgot. I tell her my name and she says she wishes more people were like me. She hugs me and says that she hopes to see me again. I say goodbye and walk back home alone."
