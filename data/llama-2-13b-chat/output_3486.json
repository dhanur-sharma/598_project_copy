She would smile at one time and in the next second yell at the stove. She would throw plates around the room and then apologize for throwing them. She would get crayons and start to eat them and then puke them right after. I think she might have some mental issues. I hope she gets better. She also did some jumping jacks while eating pancakes. She would sing the theme song to I Love Lucy while doing this activity. She was a strange one indeed. I didn't get any videos of this happening. This would of been a goldmine of views. I could of made money off of it. My mother was shocked about this. My next girlfriend should be saner."
