        "Summarize the following story in first person: \u201cJulie and the girls at Jet Set Getaways have planned two unforgettable trips to Italy for me and my family. They both were perfect from the start. The hotels, tours, and restaurant recommendations were all amazing from Rome, to Il Borro, Florence, and Sorrento. Our cooking class in Florence in Meri\u2019s Tuscan kitchen was a highlight topped off with a full day boat tour along the Sorrento Coast, Capri Island, and Nero Bay with Giovanni and having lunch at Conca Del Sogno on our last day. It\u2019s truly an experience we will never forget. Can\u2019t wait to have Julie and Get Set Getaways plan our next trip\u201d Jet Set Getaways make dreams come true. Outstanding on every level. I\u2019ve flown over 1 Million miles in my life and traveled extensively. Julie and company are true professionals and far exceed any and all expectations. I cannot recommend high enough. Pure professionals and handle incredible details. Do yourself a favor - retain the outstanding services of Jet Set Getaways and I guarantee you will be impressed. Job well done Julie. When thinking of booking travel, three words come to mind: convenience, relaxation & luxury. When booking with JSG each of these elements has always been met & often exceeded. From the onset of booking our honeymoon, JSG was prompt to provide hotel recommendations that were matched with our desires for our trip to Greece. We stayed at the Blue Palace - Marriott Luxury Collection in Crete & The Chromata in Santorini. When we checked in, the staff pulled up our itinerary & knew what extra Virtuoso Amenities would be included, which luckily afforded an upgrade for our stays. Additionally, to our surprise, we receive a hand written letter with welcome treats & wine at each hotel! It was incredible to walk in our room & feel so special. The JSG team treats each of their clients exceptionally & personably. All details are thought of from the inception of the booking process & throughout the stay. I would highly recommend putting your trust in the JSG team to plan your next vacation!"
