        "Summarize the following story in first person: A little while back, my friend and I had gone to a fitness expo that focused on nutrition and proper training techniques for progress. It was located in Connecticut, so we had to go on a road trip to get over there to participate. It was a very exciting opportunity and one that we were both looking forward to greatly. To get there, we took shifts driving, with each of us driving 3 hours! When we got to the expo, we were really exhausted, to say the least. It all began with a bunch of guest lecturers telling us their pieces and great advice in areas that they all specialize in. I was greatly informed on things that I never had considered before. After that, we were informed we'd all participate in a contest against each other! It was split up into a bunch of teams, 3 on each team, and I was very nervous and didn't think I had a shot at all in winning the prize. I tried my very best and really kicked my own butt, and somehow myself and my teammates miraculously won over the other team! It was certainly because I had put forth my best effort, since I was the one who clinched the win with my breakneck sprint at the end. I still can't believe we had done it! I was super sore after it all. Soreness was nothing though, since I made it with a prize in my pocket on the way out! I definitely couldn't have done it without the support of my friend who was there with me."
