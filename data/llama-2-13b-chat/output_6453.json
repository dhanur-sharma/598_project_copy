        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was a normal day, but a tinge of something special. I woke up on time as normal, though I wouldn't be going to work today. Well, I guess in a way we did end up working. It's the day of a wedding, specifically for my two friends Paul and Hannah. They got engaged last summer, and it reminds me now of when my wife and I introduced them to each other. During breakfast my wife said something along the lines of, \"You better be ready to help them out! You know they couldn't hire many workers so almost everybody in attendance will be helping out!\" I groaned, but she consoled me. \"I'm sure there's some kind of benefit to this all... You know, maybe even later tonight.\" Well, I knew exactly what that meant, and she knew exactly how much it'd motivate me. The wedding was fine and all, but I couldn't get my mind off of what my wife mentioned. I really just wanted to get out of there and do it. But well, we really did have to help out. I ended up helping with the cooking and disposing of trash. My wife also helped with the cooking, teasing me a bit every now and then, but I didn't see her much until that night. Well, she looked more beautiful than ever, and I couldn't get my mind off of her. As we left, she said, \"Well that wasn't so bad, was it?\" \"You know why...\" I said, slyly. Well, according to that night, I knew exactly why."
