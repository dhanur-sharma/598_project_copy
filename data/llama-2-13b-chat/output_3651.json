        "Summarize the following story in first person: I recently completed a 10K race despite having some health issues prior to the race.   The race was on the 4th of July and the weather conditions were good for running.   However, as I mentioned, I had been struggling the last several months during my runs as my breathing had been more challenging and I had periodically found the need to stop and rest in some of my runs.   Once this race started, I initially experienced some of the same breathing and physical pain issues and very briefly considered stopping or dropping out but I decided to persevere.   I found that I was falling behind during the first 2K of the race.   I willed myself to keep going even though I knew that I did not have a good pace.   After the first 2K though, I no longer had the breathing or physical pain issues and I started to push myself on the race course.  I found that I was now passing other runners and with each runner I passed, I felt another surge of energy and motivation.   I found a challenging but sustainable pace and I felt pleased that I was able to finish strongly despite my slow start.   It was very emotional for me to be able to finish the race strong as I had felt so bad at the beginning of the race.   Despite having run many races in my life, I found that this experience was rewarding as this was one of the first races where I had to will myself to keep going and to not stop.   I felt that this race was one that I would be able to use for future situations where I need to tell myself that I can keep going.    I was also motivated by how much I was able to recover during the race and to build my pace back up to my previous times.   I ran the race with a good friend who finished several minutes ahead of me and it was rewarding to also have him as part of this experience.    Overall, this was my most memorable running experience in 2019 and one that I will reminisce about and use as inspiration and motivation in the event of future challenges."
