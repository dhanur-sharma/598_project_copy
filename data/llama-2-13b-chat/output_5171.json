        "Summarize the following story in first person: What a wild party! I was looking forward to this get together and meeting up with old friends that I haven't seen in many years. We started out by going to a restaurant and having a great meal. Then one of my friends decided that we should go on an adventure through the city. He stated that he had never been in a gay bar. None of us had and then made a decision to go to a couple. After a quick search, we found several gay bars in the area. It was during this time that we drank some more and smoked a joint in the car ride. We parked at the first club. It was very interesting to see a culture that we are not normally integrated into. After having a few drinks and then smoking aother j on the way to my place, we were feeling no pain. Once at my place, the party and good times continued. We recounted stories from the past in a very drunken state. It was actually very odd having my friends here as I have never had anyone else over to my place. We had a great time together and it way fun, but it is not something that I will repeat in the near future."
