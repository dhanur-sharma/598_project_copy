        "Summarize the following story in first person: Even though I waited for this all year I can't believe two weeks ago it finally happened. Our 18 year wedding anniversary. Me and Susan actually made it. And what a delightful evening it turned out to be. Now, me and her have always tried to explore the culinary world as best as we can. But, tonight, we decided to go back to our roots. Luckily, I had the perfect restaurant in mind. There is this little hole-in-the-wall Italian place that my parents used to take me to when I was young. So, as I knew the wine would flow that night, we took an Uber to the location. It was absolutely perfect as I rented out the whole restaurant (and made sure I tipped the wait staff accordingly. There were lights, there were cheesy Italian songs, it was great. We got there, sat down, and had some bread and some sort of antipasto to start. We managed to get through most of a bottle of the house wine before we even reached the main course. Now I definitely said we were going back to our roots so these were very basic meals. I had a simple carbonara while she had fettucini alfredo. Both were divine as we tasted each other's dishes. After a few more glasses of wine and some incredible cannoli we went back to our house to enjoy some incredibly expensive champagne and some incredibly passionate sex. It was the perfect anniversary."
