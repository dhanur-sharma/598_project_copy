        "Summarize the following story in first person: Having a child is a total miracle. Worries of how you\u2019ll perform as a parent are overwhelmed as you look into their eyes and you know it\u2019s going to be OK. Kids call you to a higher level of living.  I cried when my daughter was born.  These weren\u2019t quiet, demure tears. They were big, breathless sobs. The very air sucked out of me as I held my baby, her own squalling cries drowning out my own. I was overwhelmed. I had never felt so much before. Conventional parenting wisdom says the day your child is born is one of the happiest of your life.  At the time I didn\u2019t feel happy. I barely knew what I felt at all.  I was filled with an indescribable emotion\u2014some mix of everything all at once. I was awed. I was humbled. I was proud.  I loved myself then more than I ever had before. I couldn\u2019t be all bad if I had created something so small and precious. I held her and let myself be swept away by the feeling. I laughed\u2014and even laughed as I cried.  I didn\u2019t know I could love so much. I didn\u2019t know anything in the world could be so important to me and so worth protecting. But, when she was born, something in me changed."
