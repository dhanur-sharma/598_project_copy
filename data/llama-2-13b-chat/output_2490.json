        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was so hard when my son left home to start his new job.  I had been through this experience myself when I left home years ago. My father was so broken up and I was afraid that I would do the same.  In my mind I imagined giving the boy meaningful advice and having a big moment. I thought of all the things I could say and do to make the moment right. But when the time came, all I could do is a give a hug and not speak a word.  Ever since this happened four months ago I still think about it.  This was supposed to be a big moment.  Something that my son would remember as he went through his life.  I wanted to arm him with advice that he could take and propel himself forward with.  I wanted to have a moment like you see on TV.  But alas, seeing him off didn't go that way.  At certain times, thinking about this event even makes me feel weak.  However, as more time passes I realize that this moment was great in its own right.  I didn't have the words that I wanted to say, but I've never been great at these moments.  My son could tell how emotional I was, and knows how proud I am all the same. Our actions mean more than words and my love was on display that day.  I also remind myself, that no matter the advice I could have given, everyone needs to learn for themselves and my son will be just fine doing the same."
