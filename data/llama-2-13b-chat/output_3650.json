        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was about three months ago. I was mad because I could not seem to pick fast my pace after I broke my toe (back in May).  I had two months out of the working out life, meaning only staying at home for the first week because at work my boss allow me to rest for five days so I could recover well. I had plenty of work to do in my house, between the household tasks, online gigs and of course the work that my boss send to do for the week off. It was difficult for me, I had never been in this situation. All my life had been until this point without any serious ill or difficult situation, given that this situation is not the most difficult at all too. I mean I was not diagnosed with a serious condition that would change my life entirely, but anyways I felt that I loss something important in my life. I know, it can be seen as selfish, but it is how I am feeling and I have the right to at least wrote my thoughts. Continuing with the story, after the first week at home, I was feeling better and the doctor allowed to go recover most of my normal routine except for the intense workout, even the less intense session because healing was still taking its sweet time. I got lost between writing my emotions and thoughts that I forgot to wrote an important fact for this entry, at least to remember why I was feeling like this at the moment. Well, the accident happen while I was during a WOD in the box, I was doing great that but overconfidence took a toll on me. I got reckless during a climbing the rope part and when I was going down and I did not put my feet right to land correctly and the pain took over. My toe took the heavy part of the impact. It was all red, purple and swollen. I was taken immediatly to the clinic. There they gave the diagnosis and correct the damage and that was the beginning of this episode. I will try to keep recording this experience as a reminder to be strong."
