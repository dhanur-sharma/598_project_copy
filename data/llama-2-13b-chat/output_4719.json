        "Summarize the following story in first person: About like a month ago my friend called me crying saying that he was suffering of depression. I immediately grabbed my keys and jacket and ran to his house. When I saw him he was laying on the floor grabbing his legs crying , I hugged him and asked him what was going on? . At first he didn't want to talk , so I just hugged him and waited until he felt comfortable enough to start talking.  After like twenty minutes he told me that he have been suffering from depression for a while now, he been feeling super sad and he does not know why is it, because he has in life everything that he could ask for. But the past few days the depression have been making him think weird things , like taking his own life, that's why he has not been answering no ones call. I told him not to worry and that I was going to be there to help him in everything that he needed. Later that day he said that we wanted to tell me something but that he felt ashamed. I reassured him that I was his friend and the last thing I would do is to judged him. So he confessed me that earlier that day he tried to take his own life, I got super scared I didn't know what to say or how to react, I stood quiet for a couple of seconds , and then realized that the best thing he could have done was to tell me because in that way I could help him to get the help he needs. I told him how brave he was for telling me , and how happy I was that he trusted me so much for talking about something that is not easy to say, I told him not to worry about and that there is a lot of people in the world dealing  with depression and how there is a lot of help available for those that want to get better. I told him that I was going to stay there with him and that I was not going to leave him alone in this journey. We decided to rest and eat something and how we planned to call some psychology doctors at the very next day.  At the next morning I woke up very early to do some research and see who are the best doctors to take care of this type of problems. I found a couple I made couple of calls and found one that could work perfectly for him , I made an appointment that very same morning since I explained them how important it was for my friend to speak with someone that had experience. I woke my friend up , and told him to get ready to go and see the doctor."

After the session my friend felt a little better , the doctor gave him some advice and prescribed him some medication to help him with his depression. My friend was so happy because he finally felt that someone understood him and was willing to help him. He told me that he felt so relieved and that he was so thankful for me being there for him. I felt so happy because I saw my friend smiling again. After the session we went out to eat something and then we went to my house to rest. I spend the whole day with him just talking and listening to him. We watched some movies and TV shows, just to make him laugh and feel better. That day was one of the hardest days of my life because I saw my friend suffering but at the same time I saw how brave he was to open up and talk about his problems. I saw how strong he was to keep fighting and how much he wanted to get better. And I saw how much he needed someone to be there for him and how much he appreciated my presence.  That day I realized how much I love my friend and how much I was willing to do to help"
