        "Summarize the following story in first person: Bonding With My Father-in-LawMy father-in law and I have always gotten along but when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer last year a new relationship blossomed between us. I am not a nurse but I have had cancer myself and a lot of other health related issues and although I was a cancer counselor for a time in my career he has never asked me for advice about anything. After being diagnosed with prostate cancer he started asking me questions. He asked questions about his choices, sending me radiology reports and wanting \"my take\" on the findings. We found we could talk about a very private thing very easily. He opened up to me about private and personal topics I never thought he would talk to me about. More than about his disease he talked to me about his thoughts on death. With his confidence in me I tried to do all I could to teach myself about the illness (including going to a support group for prostate cancer-in which I said \"no I don't have prostate cancer but want to hear the nurse's lecture\" and was welcomed by all!). I tried to help him make choices but not tell him what he should do (I guess that was my counselor training kicking in). I think that is why he was coming to me for counseling instead of other family members.  tried to be objective. I have gotten to know him on a much deeper level and I think it is mutual-never envisioned that with him (he can be a bit crusty on the outside!). During his decision making processes and treatment phases he knew I was a phone call away or email. It wasn't always convenient timing but I was glad to help. He has finished the first phase of treatment and is waiting to have tests in a couple of months to see the results. He will never be cured (as it was metastatic) but even though he is over the worst and feeling better now I still get the emails and calls more frequently but now he just wants to check on \"me\"."
