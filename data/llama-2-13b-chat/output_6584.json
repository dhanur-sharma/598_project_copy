        "Summarize the following story in first person: Waking up this morning was the worst. I found that my laptop was soaked even though it was inside. After looking into where the water could have come from I found that the water was coming in from the chimney. Now not only do I have to buy a new laptop I have to repair the chimney. Along with that I also have to repair all the damaged drywall. This day couldn't have started off any worse honestly. Now I have to deal with my insurance and contractors to get everything repaired. This is going to take forever and it is a complete pain. I'm researching who I can come and have repair it all. I'm looking at thousands in damages. Hopefully this day gets better soon. On the positive side at least I'll get new paint colors. And a new laptop. Trying to see things from the positive side. Fingers crossed tomorrow is a better day."
