We are in are prime years and thought of having kids of our own instead of just having dogs with us. He said we are not getting young anymore and this is what we always wanted to have a big family. We tried to conceived for couple of months and we were successfully conceived after a while. It was a bit hard for me because I was vomiting and having morning sickness the whole day. I cant even go out and have fun because I was so sensitive with anything I smell. So 9 months had passed so quick I was able to deliver a bouncing baby girl. I was so happy I cant even tell how lucky to have her in my life. But life isnt just all rainbow.  Recently I am so obsessed with my daughter and cant even leave her with anyone. I was always feeling blue and cant see good in everyday. I feel like I dont want to live anymore. But I dont want to discuss it to my husband. I seek for the guidance of a Psychologist and prescribe me medication and got counseling with our Parish Priest. I felt how God loves me for letting me surpassed this events in my life. I didnt thought  that I postpartum depression is real and with people who loves you and care about you will help you get through it."
