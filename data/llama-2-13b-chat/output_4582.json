        "Summarize the following story in first person: I wanted to attend a historical All-Star game. Yet, I knew that I could not afford to attend. I decided to try to attend another event surrounding the game, but my mother became ill. Since my relative really enjoys baseball and could not attend any of the events, I decided to do something special. I perused MLB 's website and I found a cap. Yet, I wanted a really stylish one. Therefore, I continued to look on the site and I found the perfect hat. It was similar to what everyone was sporting and had a signature logo on it. It was the right cap for my relative to receive in lieu of him missing the game. As a result, he was so happy. I was grateful that I was able to find some memorabilia for him. Yet, still sad that I could not attend. As I watched the game that night, I was happy with the outcome because someone from my home team won MVP. It was one of my fondest memories. I am grateful that my hometown hosted and the game ended well."
