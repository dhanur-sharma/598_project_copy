        "Summarize the following story in first person: My grandfather's funeral. It took a long time to actually happen because of the government shutdown and he was in the military so my grandmother had to wait until everything was cleared to be able to bury him and get his honors at the local military cemetery. He died from cancer. I don't think he was sick for long. The most memorable thing was getting to meet family members that I had never met before because my grandfather had had a fallen out with them. Oh and the firing of the guns at the funeral was also memorable. That had probably been the most time I had spent with that side of the family since I don't get to see them often. One of my cousins lead the sermon at the funeral since he preaches at his own church. Our family isn't big so it was pretty intimate. There were some funny and nice stories about him in his youth. Also go to reunite with some siblings I don't see often. Found out some more information about the family since my brother is interested in family research. Talked about everyone's careers. I didn't know that I had some distant cousins in show business so that was cool to find out. I now try to keep in touch with that side of the family more."
