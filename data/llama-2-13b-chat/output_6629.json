        "Summarize the following story in first person: I attended my fathers funeral about a month ago.  I was shocked and surprised by his death.  When I got ready in the morning, I couldn't hold it together.  I was scared that I would break down and not be able to talk to the people at the service.  I knew that I had to deliver a message at the funeral and I was extremely nervous that I wouldn't be able to get through it.  I wen't  with my sister to the funeral.  We greeted our family and friends and took our seats.  I lost it.  I couldn't bear to see my Dad dead laying in front of me.  He looked nothing like himself.  I tried to regain my composure with no success.  I got angry and scared, why did this happen?  It was my turn to speak and I was shaking.  I didn't think that I would make it through.  I got up and delivered my words with grace and held my composure.  I was proud of myself, but I ached inside for my family and my Dad.  I knew I had to be strong for my mom, so I kept many of my feelings inside.  Since his death, I still feel angry and sad but I am making progress."
