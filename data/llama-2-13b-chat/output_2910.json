        "Summarize the following story in first person: My best friend and her future husband were dating for ages. They are school sweethearts so they founds each other pretty early in their lives. I've been waiting for her fiance to propose for years now. He was planning to propose few times before but every time something went wrong and he canceled the event. So finally this time he asked me for help. I already planed her engagement in my head few times before. I was so excited and happy for them. I thought that prom party would be the best idea because of the way they met and memories that we share. It was not an easy party to arrange. It took me a lot of planning and lying to my best friend to pull off this party. At the end of the day the party was a huge success and my girlfriend said YES. It was an amazing day. I will never forget the look at the face when she found out what was going on. I'm a maid of honor in her wedding next summer. I hope that the wedding will be as amazing as her engagement. Fingers crossed."
