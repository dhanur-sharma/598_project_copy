        "Summarize the following story in first person: About a month ago, my first son began crawling. It was an awesome experience to watch him learn how to move on his own. To be able to put him down and let him do his own thing was a welcome experience after several months of carrying him everywhere. I love to watch him explore his world and interact with things. He is growing so fast and I am so proud of every little accomplishment he achieves. I enjoy watching him play with the cat and the dog. We have had to move a lot of things to higher places that he cannot reach. I had to redo my home theatre system because he kept pushing buttons that I did not want him to press. I am willing to do the extra work around the house so that he has a safe and functional environment to play and learn in. I am lucky enough to work from home so I get to be around him all the time. It is great to be able to spend so much time with him and help him learn and develop his skills. I look forward to the day that he takes his next step and begins to walk. That experience will present its own challenges and I look forward to facing those with him. Every time his independence increases and his reliance on me decreases I feel like my experience as a parent gets better. I love being with him and his personality shines as his abilities increase. I can't wait to see the person that he becomes."
