        "Summarize the following story in first person: I experienced my first train ride with my daughter approximately three months ago.  We rode from Tennessee to Utah to visit my sister and her husband.  Our adventure started in Nashville as a bus trip, and when we arrived in Indiana, we transferred ourselves and our luggage on a train.  The bus trip was a little cramped, but amusing.  A male passenger across from me kept cursing during his phone conversation.  The bus driver had no qualms with correcting the young man's outbursts.  Later during the drive, the bus driver attempted her best to not doze off.  During the last leg of the trip she swerved a few times. To keep herself awake, she started to hum.  The bus driver hummed louder and louder as we progressed closer and closer to the bus/train station.  I was amused to the point of giggling.  My daughter was not.  My daughter didn't get much sleep the night before our trip, and she had hoped she would make up for it during our bus ride.  When my daughter and I ended our bus trip and arrived in Indiana, we experienced a dull four hour layover.  Maybe it was dull because it was the wee-hours of the morning.  But she and I amused ourselves by cracking jokes and making silly comments. After the long four hours, we finally boarded the train and had begun our cozy and adventurous ride to Utah.  Our first stop was in Chicago.  My daughter and I had to transfer ourselves and our luggage to another train.  The customer service gentleman who assisted us with the transfer was kind, comedic and inquisitive.  He and I exchanged jests and sarcasms after he made an inquiry concerning our reasons for going to Utah.  The customer service gentleman also joked about the size of my daughter's luggage.  He stated that he was sure that he would be able to fit inside of the suitcase and tag along with us.  My daughter and I were refreshed by the comical exchange with the customer service gentleman.  After transferring our luggage, my daughter and I discovered the food court in the train station ate a delicious meal, and then made our way to the Chicago train station waiting area to begin the last half of our adventure."
