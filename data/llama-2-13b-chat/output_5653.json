        "Summarize the following story in first person: I am the coach of a youth level baseball team. This year marked my 10th year as a head coach. I was a major part in starting this program back in the summer of 2009. Since the beginning our our program we have fielded about 65 teams. 3 of them have won our league championship. This summer I took a team that had a losing record and tried to become the 4th team in our history to complete a championship run.  The season started off well and the boys responded well to all the training and upgraded competition.  We found ourselves as the number 2 seed in our division and the number 6 seed overall out of 45 teams. Things turned for the worst when we lost to a team we had beat 4 times earlier. We needed to win the next 2 games and keep our runs against down just to advance into the playoffs as a wildcard team. Somehow we found a way and won 2 very close games. The next morning we played in the quarterfinal against the team we lost to prior. Let\u2019s just say the boys came to play. It was our biggest margin of victory the entire season. Our semifinal game was a nail bitter. This ended up as a 1 run game that we won in the last inning of play. On to the Championship the boys were on cloud nine! It was amazing watching them play with confidence and finally realizing they were the best team on the field. We took an early lead and never looked back. Finishing off the season with a 8-5 win and a record of 42-8. What an amazing season, one that I will never forget!"
