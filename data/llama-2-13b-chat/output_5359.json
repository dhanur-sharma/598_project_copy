        "Summarize the following story in first person: What is the point of trying to be the best mother possible when your children are just going to disrespect and break your heart? I just had to decide to do what is best for my family and myself by letting my oldest son go. He has decided that he is grown and no longer needs me. That part I can accept. I know that he is legally an adult, I get that he has to become his own person. What I don't get is how can he disrespect in the way he has? He just stood in my yard and called me out of my name. I feel that he has taken everything I have ever done for him and thrown it back in my face. As if I am not good enough, as if I have not done well enough, for him to call me 'Mom'. I can deal with a lot of things. I can support him when he needs help, when he makes mistakes. However, I cannot and will not allow anyone to disrespect me in such a way. It is unacceptable for him to treat me with anything less than respect when he believes he no longer needs me. Does that mean that when he decides he needs something from me, that I will once again be 'Mom'? I am furious that he can do this to me. I am hurt that my baby boy has the ability to basically betray me. That is exactly what he has done. He has betrayed the Mother/Son bond that we have. Now, I have to show him that if he can't respect and appreciate me the way that I deserve, I will not jump at the chance to be his saving grace again."
