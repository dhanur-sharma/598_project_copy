        "Summarize the following story in first person: A few months ago two young adults  stole some artifacts.  They did as part of initiation for a social group.  As they were leaving the museum they saw a Park Police.  He was a short,  stubby man with a hint of curiosity written over his face.  He stopped the men as they approach the park. The police office asks, \"why are you strolling the park at this particular time?\" One nervously replied that he was late studying for a important exam for tomorrow.  Then the police officer said you have a heavy backpack.  Do you have any thing that I need to be concern about?  He added that I can take you to the stations if I need to look in your backpack. They replied uneasily that no, it was books and a laptop that were in their bags. The office mood shifted. He thought about his children and how he would like to be treated.  Okay, stay in school and make your parents proud. They felt at easy with the officer.  Goodnight was said by the young adults as they smugly left the park with the stolen artifacts."
