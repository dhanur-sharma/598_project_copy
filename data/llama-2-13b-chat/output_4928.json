        "Summarize the following story in first person: I went to work today. It was my last day of work which was bittersweet. I am looking forward to relaxing and pursuing my hobbies, but I don't know what it will feel like not going to a job five days a week. I was actually more sad than I thought I would be on my ride to work thinking of not seeing my coworkers every day. I parked my car at my usual parking space , but didn't have much to take into work . I had already cleared out my office so there was really not much I needed. I went into the building and greeted everyone on way to my office. Everyone was acting giddy today , but I thought nothing of it. I assumed there was some good news about the company they didn't feel the need to share with me any longer. I got to my office and preceded in tidying up my paperwork and closing all of my accounts when my supervisor called me to her office. When I reached her office she was waiting for me at her door and asked me to walk with her. Our conversation centered around what I would be doing from now on and she told me how much I would be missed. I wasn't paying attention to where we were walking, but when she opened the door to the break area, I heard all of my coworkers yell \"Surprise\". It took me a moment to realize what was happening , but when I did, tears came to my eyes. They presented me with a Memento of a plague and we spent the next hour reminicsing and saying our goodbyes. There were party games and of course tales of the wonderful memories we had shared. I will cherish this day as long as I live."
