I liked the idea of installing a birdbath. I read all the tips about how to do it. I even added took out some books from the library for inspiration. After I found the perfect set up I moved forward with building the birdbath. It took a lot more work than I thought. I spent 3 weekends building the entire thing, but it was perfect. I  had finally won and could reclaim my window from the neighbor. Unfortunately, I had underestimated how much work it really was to build the bath. After I finished I was unable  to walk normally for a month. My back is finally starting to feel better. I guess I learned that being vengeful has its pitfalls. I will never lift anything that heavy again. It was worth it though, because I won!"
