        "Summarize the following story in first person: Three weeks ago, I woke up with an urge for excitement. I recently got divorced and was ready for big changes in my life. As I lay in bed I wondered what I could do, I felt suffocated for years while married and for the first time in a long time I felt free. Free to do whatever I wanted, I am not getting any younger I thought to myself. I got out of bed and went through my drawer for old diaries, I thought I would relive one of my best memories. Maybe go to six flags or.. as I opened the diary the first page I saw was about some goals I had years ago. In that entry.. travel the world was #2. You see I always wanted to travel the world I but my ex husband put me off of it by telling me we had no money or savings for things like that.  As I stood there looking at my old diary I decided that I wanted to make that my number one goal for right NOW! I went downstairs, made myself a cup of coffee and jumped into the shower. I was exited about the possibility of travelling, I could leave everything behind and start over again some place else. My thoughts went everywhere, I wondered which country I would visit first, if I should look for air bnb or stay at a hotel. How much money do I have and where can I get more money from. With my thoughts all over the place. I got out of the shower, got dressed and started my research. I opened my laptop and went on to youtube and the first video I saw was about a could who sold everything and traveled the world for 9 months. As if this was my fate, I took this as a sign that I too should do this. I called up a friend who is a realtor and asked her to list my three bedroom starter home. She was confused and wanted to go out for a drink but I had allot to do and explained to her that I need to sell my furniture and everything inside my house and if we could have coffee at my house anytime she is free. She came over within an hour and thought I was going crazy. She did help me and knew of a family that might be interested in purchasing my house. Over the next few days I spend my time between cleaning, selling and getting organized. The family who were interested in purchasing came to have a look at it while I was still getting organized. The family were in urgent need of a place to live as they were moving from a different state but nothing could have prepared me for selling my house within 3 weeks and with a cash sale."
