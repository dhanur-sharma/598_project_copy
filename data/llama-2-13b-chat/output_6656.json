        "Summarize the following story in first person: I am just finishing up my summer vacation - 3 weeks in Vermont visiting friends and family.  I come visit once a year, but I don't usually get to spend this much time here, which was great!  I grew up here in a semi rural community, but my parents got a great job offer in NY so we moved to Albany.  We still have a cabin up here out in the woods not too far from where I grew up so that's where I stay when I (or we!) come visit.  I spent the first few days of the trip just getting settled in with my dog Sasha, and we did a lot of hiking around.   I love nature and even seeing the same places when I come, they are always still just as beautiful. I had been going through a bit of a rough patch since I broke up with my gf of 3 years and this was exactly what I needed. Speaking of, the festival itself was fantastic.  I hooked up with a few people still left in town from HS that I grew up with and the first day we pregamed pretty good before we went.  They had plenty of live music and people from all over the state came with almost anything you could want.  My favorite parts were the garlic and cheese sections, the garlic people were set up in front on days 1 and 2 while the cheese folks were in the spotlight on days 4 and 5.  One of my friends actually got me to be on the panel for judging dishes there as well, which I couldn't thank them for enough.  It was so much fun and I got to get a bunch of recipes to bring back home with me!  Plus, I got to meet a chef from a few towns over who has their own show on the Food Network.  For someone who loves cooking as much as me, I felt like I was meeting an idol almost! Other than that, we spent a lot of time out in nature, bringing Sasha with us to our favorite lake to swim in from when we were kids.  My friends and I even spent a few days hiking even deeper into nature and pitching tents for a mini camping trip.  It was definitely one of my favorite visits out here!  I was able to completely get back in tune with myself and let nature and people boost me back up when I was down."
