        "Summarize the following story in first person: I know a man called C (not his real initial). He and I have tried a romantic relationship twice now. After I ended things the first time out of frustration, out of feeling like I wasn't being listened to, we stopped talking. I don't typically go back to a relationship, but when he approached me again a year later, I considered it. There had been some really great aspects, certainly. The next time was better, but still not great. I once again felt ignored and that he wasn't listening to me plainly telling him what I needed in a relationship - I didn't demand anything, but I told him how I felt and he said he would improve or change and never did. After months of this, I sat down with him and told him that if he couldn't meet me in the middle the way I had tried to meet him, it seemed our relationship was over. He accused me of being abusive, which was devastating. I have been through abusive relationships and consider myself pretty aware of what is abusive and what is not, to be accused of abuse is so hurtful. We stopped talking again. Then a few months ago, C messaged me. It was an apology. Looking back...I don't think his first apology was so great. We more agreed that it was an incompatibility issue. But this second apology was so healing for me. He took responsibility for everything he had done in the relationship, apologized for calling me abusive, and explained how he was addressing his more hurtful behaviors. Considering how little things really changed between the first and second times, I can see that he was not addressing the core of his issues. Having such a broad, bold, honest, open apology, with no conditions, was so immensely healing for me. He and I had a conversation where we spoke about what had happened; throughout, he continued to take responsibility for his role in our problems. It really helped to heal a pain I hadn't known I was clinging to."
