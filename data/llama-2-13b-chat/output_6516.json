        "Summarize the following story in first person: I never thought I'd be the type of person to own a ferret but I just couldn't walk away from this adorable monster. I named him Trouble because he is always looking for it. I tried to get my friend Travis to take him but he refused, and it was a blessing in disguise. My dog, Ally, and Trouble get along all too well and Ally seems to have a lot more energy now that she has someone to play with. Though owning a ferret is a lot less work than I thought it'd be. I don't have to groom him. Nor does he claw on any furniture, unlike a cat. Trouble is also very affectionate towards me and Ally. I half expected him to raise hell and trash my house. He loves to sleep in the bed with me and I think Ally get's jealous, because she's too large to share a bed with. It's hard for me to believe that someone would just toss him out. He loves to cuddle and we've bonded very quickly. Now I just have to wait and see what my wife says when she gets back from her trip. Especially after I exclaimed that we couldn't possibly have any more pets. She's never going to let me live it down."
