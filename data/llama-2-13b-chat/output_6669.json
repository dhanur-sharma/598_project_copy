        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was a terrible series of events, my ex-boyfriend, Jeff, the jail bird, was very abusive towards me and was quite casual about his demand for anything he wanted from me. If you ever look up what a person is who is a user and a loser, there will be a photo of Jeff next to the very definition. Diary, I have told you about how he was a suspected rapist and I know he used hard drugs and lied all of the time about where he was and what he did, but my new boyfriend, Steve, has been the light of my life lately. I'm so lucky to have Steve. We met at the Farmer's Market. He's tall and handsome, and smiles a lot. I was with Jeff the day I met Steve, and Jeff became insanely jealous immediately. I barely tried to hide my attraction to Steve and even mentioned it to Jeff. I said \"He's cute\". That morning, I was slapped by Jeff so hard after we got back to our car, in the parking lot of the Farmer's Market. I would usually feel the tears welling up in my eyes immediately but not that morning. I got out of the car and walked inside and handed my business card directly to Steve and told him \"Call me, I want to get coffee with you, tonight?\" and he sort of smiled and shrugged as picked up some cardboard boxes and said \"Cool, is it ok to call this afternoon?\" and I smiled and said \"of course it is!\". I walked out of the parking lot, past Jeff's car. Jeff followed me for a while, and begged me to get into his car but I just ignored him and kept walking through the snow on the sidewalk. It's been two months now and I feel so great about my life with Steve now. He has never struck me, he opens doors for me, he is polite and kind and good and amazing and a thoughtful lover. All of the things that Jeff was not. I hope that someday soon, I will forget the name of the man I tried to find love with, only to be shown what love is not. Things are so much brighter now, the birds sing, the sky is bluer and my life seems destined for fulfillment."
