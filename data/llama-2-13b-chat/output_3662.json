        "Summarize the following story in first person: Some time ago I had moved into my apartment. I just needed some where to stay I didn't want to live in hotels anymore. It was expensive and I couldn't cook. There was also very bad neighbors or guests going in and out. Some quite some loud I just couldn't deal anymore. So eventually I started looking for an apartment in my city. I was able to find a few but not all of them were great. Overtime after looking for a little while I was able to find something decent enough. I was able to get the apartment on an 12 month lease but things didn't go all the way. the 12th lease turned into an 11 month lease and it was a nightmare. The aparment was filled with lead in the ducts making air unbreathable. The landlord didn't even want to fix even the smallest of problems. My stove even went out so I couldn't cook how I wanted and landlord refused to fix. I contacted the board of health and they cited the landlord. That's how my 12 month lease turned into an 11 month lease because I had gotten evicted from the apartment."
