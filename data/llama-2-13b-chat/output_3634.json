        "Summarize the following story in first person: After my dad passed away, I realized that it had been a long time since I had been to Kentucky. My dad was from Kentucky and we would drive to Kentucky almost every weekend when I was a child. I have a lot of great memories of being in Kentucky. I decided I wanted to share this same experience with my family, so we planned a weekend and went. Just the car ride alone brought back many memories and gave me that wonderful feeling of nostalgia. I remembered being a kid and riding in the back seat of the car with my sister. One of our favorite things were riding in the car watching other people go by, listening to our music, reading a book and just having fun passing time while we drove our four hour drive. We visited many of the same places I went as a kid. We ate at some of the same restaurants I did, and even stayed at the same hotel. It was such a great feeling, getting to relive those memories and share it with my own family. While we were visiting some of the places I did as a child, all these wonderful feelings and memories came flooding in. It was a very very happy experience. I feel that the experience made me feel so close to my dad. I never wanted to lose any memories of my father because there were so many good memories and he was such a good person. This trip helped me to connect to all my past experiences and relive them. I think this trip made my memories so much more stronger and I am thankful I got to experience and give my family an experience of my past."
