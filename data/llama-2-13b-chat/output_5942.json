                "text": "Genes are also responsible for repairing damage to the DNA. If a gene is damaged or missing, it can cause a cell to behave abnormally and become cancerous. Cancer cells may also have changes in the number or arrangement of their chromosomes. This can cause them to behave differently than normal cells. Some cancer cells may have too many chromosomes, while others may have too few. Some may have chromosomes that are misshapen or have pieces missing. These changes can cause the cancer cells to grow and divide out of control. But what causes these changes in the first place? Cancer is caused by mutations in the DNA of our cells. Mutations are changes in the genetic material of a cell that can affect how it behaves. Mutations can be caused by many things, such as exposure to radiation or certain chemicals, smoking, or just by chance. Some mutations are harmless, but others can cause the cell to behave abnormally and become cancerous. When a mutation occurs in a cell, it can cause the cell to grow and divide out of control, leading to the formation of a tumor. Some mutations can also cause the cancer cells to"
