I know a lot of things are going to change with him coming home, but I'm hoping the changes will be for the best--for both of us. I'm so excited  that it is hard to contain how I feel. I can still hear him telling me on the phone that he is getting out. I think I will remember that moment forever! I can't wait to be able to hold him and kiss him whenever I want. I can't wait to cook him dinner and watch a movie together! There's so many things that we have missed out on because of one bad mistake that I know he has learned from. I'm hoping that he will be able to get out and get a job and get on with his life. I know he has so many regrets. I hope that our relationship is still as strong as it was before he went to prison. I hope this next year will be our best yet! I also hope that maybe we can get married now that he will be free!"
