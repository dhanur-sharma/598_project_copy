        "Summarize the following story in first person: I went to a family cookout about six weeks ago. Both sides of the family came, I haven't seen some of my father's family in years and some of my mother's family, I had never met. It was fun and exciting to see everyone and learn more about the family and where I came from. We had a BBQ and made burgers and grilled chicken, we had a few different salads and beverages. We played a few games of charades and cornhole and just reminisced about memories we shared together and with members of the family that are no longer with us. It was so nice to see everyone, the kids all had a great time playing games together. They played red-rover and man-hunt in the woods at the campground. They all came back after playing and roasted marshmallows and had watermelon. The campground is beautiful and the lot we had rented was great because it was right by the lake with beach access. If we had brought our canoes we could have pushed right off from them. We plan to do it again next year and make it an annual event, because we had so much fun. Next year we'll definitely bring the boats and maybe we'll camp out a night or two. The facilities were very nice and I think the kids would all like tent camping. Most of my mother's side of the family is from the city so it will be a new experience for them. We should bring fishing poles too. I wished I had mine with me. I saw lots of fish jumping when the sun went down."
