        "Summarize the following story in first person: Had my reunion at Cloverfield High today. It was our 50th reunion and Jerry was there; my first love. I introduced him to Jack but that didn't go so well. It was awkward and some intense feelings were showing. I think maybe Jerry misses me. He shouldnt've did what he did to me back in high school. He would be my husband instead, but so much for that. Molly was there and she was beautiful as ever. Even at such an old age. Beautiful white hair, curled, shoulder length; a blue polkadot dress on a surprisingly tight figure. Like Marilyn Monroe. We talked and caught up on so many things. It's a wonder why Jerry would be so enamored over me and Jack. He has such a wonderful woman by his side; and I know how faithful and dedicated Molly can be. I wonder when those two met. My best friend and first love getting together. What a marvelous and happy thought! Although, now that I think of it, they were friends back in high school. Very close actually. Sometimes I would see Molly there. One time I saw her sneaking out the door when I came for a surprise visit at Jerry's house(I did surprise visits on occasion). That's how I caught Jerry cheating on me. Now that I think of it, the slut he was with had the same figure. Oh my god! That sleaze bag of a friend!"

I wonder if he's still that way? Maybe I'll find out tomorrow. The reunion was fun and I'm so glad I went. I had a wonderful time and I'm so happy to have seen Jerry again.
