        "Summarize the following story in first person: A few months ago I decided to take my family on I on a trip to Las Vegas to visit my mom. I also wanted them to enjoy a small amount of fun. It took me some time to decide if I really wanted to go. At that time airline tickets were not dropping in prices, we did not have that much money saved for vacation and I just basically hate long plane rides. On the other hand I really needed to see my mom. I had been getting conflicting messages from my siblings about her health.  I really needed to see for myself how she was doing. I also needed to bring a little relief to my oldest sister that cares for my mom full time. So, we went on the five and a half hour plane ride on an airline that is fairly new that we never been on before. Needless to say it was actually a pleasant plane ride and  my family and I are new fans. We arrived fairly late, but my sister waited up for us. We walked in the door and I remember seeing my moms small fragile body laying under a thick blanket on the pull out sofa. I gave her a huge hug and kiss and told her I came to take care of her. The first two days I took my family shopping in Chinatown and on the Las Vegas strip. We also went to eat at Fukuburger (our favorite spot) the next four days I spent helping my mom with her daily needs as well as cooking an cleaning. I felt I did my best and I was able to see for myself my moms healing journey. All in all I am glad I went. I felt good about the trip and it showed my kids how much I care for my mom and that I tried my best while I was there. I have a new found respect for my sister for the work she does with my mom as well as still working her full time job."
