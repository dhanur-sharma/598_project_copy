        "Summarize the following story in first person: 2 weeks ago, I went to the park.  I decided to take my foster kitten with me because I thought it might be fun for him since he never gets to leave my house.  I wasn't sure how to play with him, though, because cats don't like to be on leashes.  I thought maybe I could find some kind of enclosed area.  When we got to the park, there was a fenced-in playground.  I thought that might be the perfect place to let him out to play.  I got a big surprise, though.  When I let him out, he climbed right over the fence.  He was just a little kitten, so I didn't think he'd be able to do that.  He just jumped right over it as though he was a full-grown cat.  I tried to chase him down but he was gone.  I didn't realize how attached I had gotten to this kitten in such a short time.  It really broke my heart.  I hope he's okay.  Maybe someone will find him and give him a good home."
