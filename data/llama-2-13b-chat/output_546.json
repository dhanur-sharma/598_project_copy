        "Summarize the following story in first person: I am very unhappy right now. I have just come home from court, yet again. My daughter, Beth, has just be involved in another crime with this 'gang' she has been hanging out with the last few years. My wife is so depressed about she can't even be involved with it anymore. This all started when Beth started hanging out with the wrong crowd around the time she turned 16. We first felt she was just going through a 'rebellious stage'. We were patient at first and tried to be supportive. The first time we found drugs (marijuana), we were calm with her but told her we never wanted to see these kinds of things in the house again. When we saw her bring boys over, we were firm but caring about the situation. It only got worst. She started hanging out during all her free time with a certain crowd of people, some of them much older than her. Her grades began to slip and we got bad reports from her teachers. It wasn't too much of surprise when we received a call from Target security that they had caught our daughter shoplifting. We had to pay a big fine but they left her off without any charges. We were livid with her on the way home. Perhaps if were more understanding...Things improved (seemingly) for Beth following this incident. Her grades improved and she even made honor roll. We had high expectations that she would still be able to get into a good college after graduation. It's sad to remember that when she was younger she was always the brightest student in her class. After this latest incident everything is finished though. She was caught by the police dealing drugs at park. Apparently it was heroin. There is nothing we can do for her now. From what the police tell us, Beth has been leading a secret life as an inspiring drug kingpin the last year. They told us that she was in contact with certain groups in Mexico to supply her with more heroin so can increase her business in the coming year. We have no choice but to kick her out at this point."
