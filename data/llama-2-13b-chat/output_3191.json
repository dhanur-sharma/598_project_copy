        "Summarize the following story in first person: Six weeks ago, my buddy came to me seeking some advice or help on an issue of his. He had been really stressed out at his job, was feeling burned out from it, and was having trouble sleeping. He knew that I have a background in psychology, as well general health and well being, so I might be able to help him out. We first talked about what he thought might have been triggering the stress and anxiety at work. He said that he was having trouble concentrating because he was always feeling fatigued at work. This fatigue was starting to impact his job performance because he was struggling to get all his tasks done during the work day. The next thing I asked him was how well he was sleeping at night, and he said that he was having a lot of trouble falling asleep. In fact, he would toss and turn for a while, and then he would get on his phone for a little while, hoping that this would make him sleepy. I explained to him that maintaining proper sleep health is really important in having high quality sleep. People should only ever do two things in bed: sleep or have sex. The reason for this, is when you do other activities in bed, you are confusing your brain on whether or not you should be sleeping. Because of this, when you lay down in bed, you should never be reading or on your phone because this can compromise healthy sleep. After that, we talked about nutrition. Eric tends to eat oatmeal for breakfast on most days, a sandwich and vegetables or fruit for lunch, and he usually orders takeout for dinner. This did not seem like a big deal to me, but when I pressed him about what he typically drinks on a daily basis, he says that he pretty much just drinks sodas or coffee all day, and only stops the caffeinated drinks half an hour before bed. I explained to him that this is a really unhealthy habit. Not only are you putting yourself at risk for diabetes and hypertension from that level of caffeine and sugar, but you are also making it very difficult for yourself to fall asleep when you drink them almost all the way up until you go to bed. My recommendation for him was to significantly cut out the caffeine from his diet (as well as drink more water), and try to maintain healthier sleep habits. These things have worked for me in the past, so I am sure that they would work for him."

I said that if he could just find something that he likes to do, and then make it a regular part of his routine, he would probably feel better overall. We talked for a bit longer after that, and I gave him some other tips and suggestions that I thought might help him. He said that he would try these things out and see how they work for him. Six weeks have now passed, and I just saw him the other day. He told me that he has been following my advice, and that he has been feeling a lot better lately. He said that he has been sleeping a lot better, and that he has more energy throughout the day. He also mentioned that he has started exercising regularly, and that he is really enjoying it. Overall, I think that my advice really helped him out, and I am glad that I could help.\n\n"
