        "Summarize the following story in first person: When I was working for the MLB team in the spring, I was working for a company event at the stadium.  There were barely any workers there, but I was with some past professional players.   One of them, my boss, went to introduce me to a guy named (let's call him Al).  I didn't think anything of this man.  When I went to shake his hand, it hurt.  He was massive and extremely strong.  I thought, \"is this Al the legend?\" No, there's no way it could be.  As the event went on, I didn't think anything of the occurrence.  Al was throwing batting practice to some of the employees.  He was also keeping them all entertained by talking on the stadium microphone.  At the end of the event, my boss told everyone to thank \"Al the legend\" for coming to the event! I was shocked that I didn't realize it was him.  I am still mad to this day that I didn't take the time to ask him any questions.   I am still on the look out for him at any events to this day.  Who knows, maybe I will run into him again and I can learn something valuable from a pro!"
