        "Summarize the following story in first person: I played a really crazy joke on my parents several years ago. I pretended that me and my girlfriend were having a baby. It nearly gave my mother a heart attack because she really believed me. She and I kept the joke going for a bit and even got a hold of some very fake ultrasound images to serve as phony proof. My mom was always big on me not having a child before getting married because she is a bit conservative like that and very religious That was never for me so I used to humor it and make it seem like that was something I was on board with. I wasn't at all, thus why we played this joke on her. I felt a bit bad but it was going to see well and she genuinely believed it, so we kept it going. My dad knew what we were doing the whole time and he didn't tell her. Anyways, she never forgot this joke and just recently,, she played a joke on us by pretending that my youngest sister had a baby. The baby was fake and we had only seen pictures of her in a stroller. Because I dont live close we were never able to verify it. So, when visiting home for the holidays, she revealed to us that it was fake and that it was actually my daughter in law that had a baby. They wanted to surprise us but also get me back for the joke we played on all of them years beforehand. It worked! They really got us good and we found it pretty darn funny. I mean, we deserved it. That's what we get for pulling our elaborate prank."
