        "Summarize the following story in first person: My grandmother passed away a few months ago and her funeral was one of the most depressing moments of my life. I still remember seeing all of my relatives get together and reminiscing about the past. There were also lots of my grandmother's friends from all over the country that came to see her. It made me think that she had a good life surrounded by loved ones. Still whenever I saw her body, I felt incredibly sad. My grandmother took care of me during a lot of my childhood years because my parents had to work a lot. She took me to school everyday, cooked a nice dinner, and entertained me. I was sad that I would never experience that again. For the last few years of her life, I rarely got to see her. I was an adult now and her to work and take care of other things. I rarely got to see my grandmother. During the funeral, our family would talk about the good times and also tell stories about how my grandmother was like before I was born. I learned lots of new things about her. She seemed like a great person and a hard worker. I cried for the first time in years when my grandmother was lowered to her grave. I hope she was in a better place now."
