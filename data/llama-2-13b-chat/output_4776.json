        "Summarize the following story in first person: It's a month and two weeks now since my last promotion. This was actually the happiest day of the year 2019.  I never saw the promotion coming. I have previously been issued several queries relating to absenteeism. I never even thought or knew that the company had her eyes on my progress. The company was carefully monitoring me to know the cause of my absenteeism. They later found out for I initially refused to let them know. It was due to my sick wife. They stopped issuing me queries for being absent. Not long after that, i was promoted to the position of a senior developer. I was really happy with this decision from them. I even had to discard the thought of searching for another job due to the inconsiderate attitude of my company. It is all good today, and I am still with them, putting my best to work as always. This is one gesture that would make me render my services to the company for a longer time. All companies should be like this."
