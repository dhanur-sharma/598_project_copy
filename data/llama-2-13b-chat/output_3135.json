        "Summarize the following story in first person: Well today was quite crazy. It was also very frightening and scary. So about 7 weeks ago, well actually it was the 4th of July when this happened, I had a low blood sugar crash. My husband and I were just having a grand time and, of course this would happen, I wasn't monitoring my blood sugar. We were very busy that day with family and prepping for the festivities. Everyone was there, my brothers, sisters, nephews and grandkids. It was joy having everyone there. Well anyway, there I was just going along with preparations when I had a low blood sugar crash. It was a quite an emergency. My husband came rushing to my aid and he helped me quite a bit. The rest of the family was quite concerned as well and tried to help as well. However, my husband had to call medical services to get help since it wasn't something we could handle. Now I'm doing better, thankfully. At least it makes for a story for our family. Now I'm going to make sure to keep myself monitored closely so it doesn't happen again."
