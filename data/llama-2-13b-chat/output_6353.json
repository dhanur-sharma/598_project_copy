        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was sleeping about a week after my fathers death and dreaming heavily. My experience dreaming heightened to some kind of new reality to where the dream felt ultra real and everything brightened. When I was younger I was into church and God but my dad was not so much. He told me when he passed he would come back to let me know if there was an afterlife. I was not able to see him before he died but everyone else did. I could not make it because of bad driving conditions. After his visit when I spoke to him on the phone he told me he did not think he had to much longer on earth and he needed to see me before he passed but this did not happen. Everything turned hyper-real and my dream quickly switched to a room with yellow walls and a bed. I was sitting on the bed sitting facing someone dressed in bright white robes. I looked and it was my deceased father. He was around 30 years old, smiling widely with mouth closed, and looked the greatest and happiest I have ever seen him. He had no eyes but there were wisps of smoke that I clearly felt as his spirit floating around inside his head. He was telling me he was spirit now and confirmed the afterlife to me. This makes me very satisfied and in awe of \"source\". \"Source\" is the word I use to refer to GOD."
