        "Summarize the following story in first person: there has been a serious accident at a T-junction. the accident occurred among 4 cars there's no specifics of the cars in question. why did this accident happened in the first place? base on the information gathered, one car caused it. the car which caused this accident wanted to overtake another car. there's no much details about the car which cause the accident. the challenge that occurred between all the drivers doesn't make sense at all. why will a driver even think of overtaking another driver at a T-junction. it doesn't make sense for a trained driver to do that. I personally think there should be a traffic light at the T-junction so to prevent anything problem in the future. By the way was there a traffic light at the T-junction? if there was a traffic light at the T-junction then why did the driver try to overtake another driver. My main point in this whole story stated above is the fact that, did they involve the police? did the police arrest the driver who tried to overtake another at the T-junction. It's a tragic seen and mentally passengers will need to visit the hospital."
