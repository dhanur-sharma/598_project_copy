        "Summarize the following story in first person: I have a dackel/wiener-dog. I woke up to him paralyzed a month ago (June). I took him to the vet, as one does, and she was just \"Put him down. That's not a good life. He'll never get better.\" since I could not afford the 10k for surgery. Went home, cried about it, thought about it, looked up paralyzed dog forums all night long. It was a pretty bad night. I just felt so goddamn hopeless about everything. The paralysis was very sudden. The night before, he was limping just a little bit when I brought him in after the walk. I thought that he'd stepped on something. The day of, other than not being able to move his back legs, he was happy and fine. Got him on steroids, did crate-rest, did laser treatments. Told \"This won't make a difference. He'll get urine scald, he's suffering.\" My vet really knows how to depress the hell out of me, I might say. Purchased bed wetting pads, barrier spray, he was happy to be home and I was just worried about the future. And, he got better. He's almost completely fine now, no thanks to my shitty vet."
