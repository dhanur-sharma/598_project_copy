        "Summarize the following story in first person: About five months ago I had a house fire. We all got out, along with our terrified cats. My husband was not able to get us in our car because the flames were too close to the vehicle. Although everything we had perished in the blaze because the fire department took a while to arrive, I thought we at least still had our car. But in the moment my husband made that decision that probably saved our lives. So we had to run down the street. We had our wallets with us and pajamas on. Our cats ran out of the house and we managed to catch them a few blocks away. The firemen directed us to a shelter, which we stayed at for two weeks. Fortunately they let our cats stay with us too. It still seems so surreal that the fire actually happened. I was so used to safety and security in my home, no matter what battles the outside world threw at me every day. I learned after this incident that nothing is ever promised. I have an appreciation for the most basic things in life now, such as food and shelter. My husband was very stressed out after this event, so my cats were the main source of comfort for me. I never told him that, because losing everything bruises the ego and I wasn't about to add to the pressure. Our insurance payment came through and we are getting back on our feet, but this is a trauma that will take time to get over."
