        "Summarize the following story in first person: I had been feeling pretty depressed lately, because I had been over-working myself. There wasn't much time in the day that I was taking to relax or reflect, and it was really starting to wear on me. I had just piled on more and more deadlines at work, thinking that I could do it all, but I was wrong. I was starting to get fatigued, and my work was suffering because of it. I was having an especially bad night, and I wanted to just give up, but I had a friend over who wouldn't let me. She told me that I needed to keep going, and basically that she believed in me, and in my ability to finish what I started. She told me that I was the hardest worker she knew, and that I was inspiring to her. She said that if I gave up, it would let her down, and that she knew I wouldn't let her down. That really helped, and it really touched me that she felt that way about me. It wasn't quite enough, though, as I was still very burned out. She told me to take the night off, and while I was relaxing, she went out and bought some things. She bought us some good food for dinner, as well as some nice wine to enjoy after.  Then, she cooked me dinner, which was really good. After that, we just relaxed, listening to music and drinking wine, not having any care about work or deadlines. It was only one night, and it didn't solve the issue of being burned out, but it did give me some more fuel to keep on going and finish my projects. I am really thankful that she did that for me, and I am lucky to have her as a friend."
