        "Summarize the following story in first person: It was a typical October evening and I was driving to my friend's annual Halloween House Party. She always has a great party at her house. I was uneasy about the costume I had selected since I had not really put in too much effort or time into it. I was dressed up as John Snow from Game of Thrones. I have the long black hair and the facial hair naturally so that was a plus. What I was uneasy about was the clothing. I had visited a Thrift Store two days before the event and had hurriedly pieced together a  \"John Snow costume\". I arrived about an hour before the party officially started to help my friend with last minute items. I was \"in between\" girlfriends so was going as \"a single guy\". To my surprise, I met a girl with incredible inner and outer beauty and a great spirit. Her name was Elyse and was my friend's cousin.  Elyse and I were exchanging looks and glances from across the room with curiosity or possibly interest in each other. I hesitated in interacting with Elyse, the way I really wanted to, since I felt my John Snow costume looked \"cheap\". I was self-conscious due to the costume so only interacted with Elyse a couple of times. I interacted with everybody else but Elyse seemed to be the one I wanted to get to know better. I knew then that it was because I had a serious interest in her and wanted to make a good impression. The evening progressed and I did manage to dance with Elyse once. One of our co-workers ended up talking with Elyse a lot and danced with her several times. The party ended and everybody went home. I saw my co-worker and Elyse talking and walking together and I knew then that I had hesitated due to a lack of self-confidence created by my \"cheap\" John Snow costume. Elyse ended up dating my co-worker for about 2-3 months but they never really \"clicked\". I ended up dating a great girl I met at an NFL Game House Party in November and have been with her since. I still think about Elyse but more importantly, I think about my hesitation to really be myself that night, as I typically am, and loosing an opportunity of dating \"the women that caught my eye and brightened my spirit\" on that memorable Halloween House Party night. It was all due to a lack of confidence / self-esteem brought about a poor choice of costume. I will never let what I am wearing dictate how I truly act or will I allow it to prevent me from being myself."
