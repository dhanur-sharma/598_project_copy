        "Summarize the following story in first person: October, I feel you. The days are becoming shorter, cooler. Birthdays and holidays are slowly coming into focus. The end of the year is near. As always,  I reflect. I enjoy January 1st. Not the recounting of another year gone, or resolutions and promises unfulfilled, but the opportunity to begin anew. Yes, I will make promises I will never keep. I know who I am though. My intentions are good. I'll promise to read more. A few classics, a few books for guilty pleasures. I'll promise myself to exercise more. Get healthy and have more energy for my kids when I get home. I'll promise to volunteer. Leaving the world a better place, making connections with those around me, doing good when no one is looking. I'll make promises to travel more. This is never really a promise, but a reminder that life is short, the world is small, and if I do not put time aside to see new places \"that day\" will never come. So, October, I guess I am glad to see you. You are my first step in winter to a new year."
