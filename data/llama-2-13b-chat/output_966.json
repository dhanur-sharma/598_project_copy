He had left a lot of emotional scars within me over the years. The abuse.. God.. How did i tolerate him? Why did i tolerate him? And to think that i paid for his mortgage from my hard earned money? I admit, i was taken aback when he came back couple months back, begging to take him back. I wasn't sure. he seemed changed. But no, i was wrong. I realized it right when he started the abuse back again. That's when i realized that i couldn't let this go on. I went see a lawyer straight away and filed a petition in court. And i won! Now he pays me, for everything i have done for him so far, for everything he had done to me. Justice prevails."
