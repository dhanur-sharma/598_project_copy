        "Summarize the following story in first person: I will never forget this moment. My boyfriend and I had just started dating after eleven years of platonic friendship. He was visiting me on the west coast for about a week. We stayed together in a hotel in the downtown part of my city. It was a few days into his visit and we had just had a long busy day of spending time together and doing touristy things around my city. We decided to part ways and I would meet him back at the hotel after he went by the store to get some food and drinks for us. We were standing in a busy intersection in one of the most beautiful parts of the city. Before going our separate directions he kissed me and said he loved me but then said he didn't mean to say that now. He seemed really embarrassed because we had only been romantic for a short period of time and it seemed a bit too soon. Also we were still long distance and unsure of where things were going to go. I pretended like I didn't hear it and it was just an accident but I knew better. In that moment I knew that he felt the same way that I felt about him. This felt like our relationship was going to go to the next level. I also thought it was a really cute mishap. Before he left for the airport a few days later, I told him that I loved him before kissing him goodbye and that I meant it, not an accident. Now we are talking about figuring out the logistics of moving in together. This relationship has been really amazing in so many ways."
