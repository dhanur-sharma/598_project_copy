        "Summarize the following story in first person: But I had to learn to use CPR and quick, as the elderly woman I had been caring for was on the floor having a seizure.  I was not used to caring for elderly patients either but somehow I got stuck with this useless hag after she was brought into our emergency unit after she had her first seizure. I had been a nurse for thirteen years and I didn't sign up for this shit. I was used to caring for younger, healthier patients that could perform basic tasks like wiping their own ass and bathing.  Even the cripple down the hall in a wheelchair is easier to take care of than this useless old bag as even he could wipe his own ass.  But nevertheless as I was getting ready to administer drugs to a patient in psych I was called to the emergency room because an old bag had a seizure and was now flopping around like a fish on her gurney that the EMT'S had strapped her onto.  They asked me to give her CPR and I asked if there wasn't anyone else around?  They said no all the nurses were busy in psych so for the first time ever I had to give an elderly woman mouth to mouth. I took a big gulp and took a long sip of water.  I wasn't mentally prepared for what I was about to do.  I closed my eyes and tried to picture the elderly woman was a more attractive younger, man.  My lips met hers and I nearly gagged as I was literally giving her mouth to mouth. I kept blowing into her mouth until finally she started coughing into my mouth and I jolted back in disgust.  The old bag had woken up and stopped shaking all over the place. Completely disgusted with what I had just done I immediately lifted her up and put her on a different gurney and was on my way to the elevator to bring her to psych when the EMT asked why I was going to bring her to the psych ward and not general care.  I lied and said we had no beds left and I really wanted to dump her off onto someone else and make her someone else's problem.  So I brought her up to psych and sedated her as she started talking non stop about her son and how he never calls her anymore.  I injected her with a large dose of oxycontin and she was out like a light.  I came back later to check on her and she wouldn't wake up.  I checked for a pulse and nothing.  She was stiff, dead as a door nail.  I panicked because I realized I had drugged her to the point where she must have died in her sleep.  I didn't know what to do, I didn't want to go to jail and I had been fired from three previous jobs for neglect. Then I remembered something, we had a patient with down syndrome who could barely spell his own name, let alone be able to tell what was going on.  So I sounded the alarm for a \"code red\" and blamed Timothy the guy with down syndrome for the elderly woman's death, I said he must have choked her while I was out changing bed pans. Timothy was sent to his room and doctor's were on their way up"
