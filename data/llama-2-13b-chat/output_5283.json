        "Summarize the following story in first person: As part of doing parking for that Garth Brooks event, I ended up talking with some of my neighbors who had open lots on other parts of the block I live on.  I talked with them about the possibility of doing parking on their lots as well, with the option of splitting the proceeds 50/50 between them and me. It was surprising how beneficial the Garth Brooks concert ended up being because I made more money than I planned on making, and then that also gave me confidence to sell parking for a graduation ceremony a few weeks after the concert. After that, I sold parking for football games in the months that followed, and I coordinated with the neighbors I had talked to on Garth Brooks concert day, so that we were able to offer parking for the whole block on football games. Having the whole block available meant having approximately 30 parking spots to sell.  The football games attract large crowds and the ticket prices range from $50 to $100 depending on the game, so I was able to charge a relatively large amount for the parking spots for the football games. I was able to earn a nice amount of money that I then put into my savings.  Being able to \"live off the land\" by selling parking has helped me feel entrepreneurial while also helping to reduce stress by giving me a safety cushion of savings. I also found myself being responsible and helpful to the customers that were parking.  I learned that customers might have many questions about the event that they were attending.  I tried to prepare beforehand by reading details about gate opening times and other event-related details, so that I could answer questions questions might have when they were parking for the event. I have been pleasantly surprised because I made far more money than I anticipated making, no one had any problems with their cars, and my neighbors were able to make a good amount of money by entering into the 50/50 agreement with me, so the whole block of residents has enjoyed added happiness in recent months as a result of me first doing parking fo the Garth Brooks concert 8-and-a-half months ago. I also got to enjoy the good feeling of being able to offer tailgate chances for the football fans who wanted to park at the game very early before game time. The tailgate parties that developed on my parking lots remained safe and I made sure to patrol the areas regularly. I wanted to make sure the vehicles were not threatened, the people were not misbehaving, and the area was maintained in a clean manner during the event.  Overall this economic experiment of doing parking for the Garth Brooks concert ended up being a great idea, and I look forward to more parking chances in the months ahead."
