        "Summarize the following story in first person: I had never had a pet but I always wanted to, However my mom would always say no because there was nobody home to take care of a pet. I had hamsters, fish and other small pets, but I wanted a real pet that I could pet and feed. I think it had to be a dog because I don't like cats. Well, I had never thought about a rabbit. It was in a magic show that we had where this cutie pie was. I loved her when I first saw it. I think rabbits are so cute but I had never be close to one. Well, I participated to be able to get her as mine. I didn't think of what my parents could say. but soon she was given to me and I could take her home. It was funny that my mom didn't like her at first, but a few days later she was just in love with this fluffy thing.  I have read a lot about rabbits to be able to take care of her. I love her. She is growing fast and likes to be pet, which I love because I thought rabbits always wanted to be alone. No, she loves to be whenever there are people and likes to lick and be pet, and gets exited when we come home just like a dog."
