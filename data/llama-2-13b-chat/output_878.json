        "Summarize the following story in first person: I recently competed in a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu tournament. It took a lot of discipline to prepare for. I had to diet and lose about 15 pounds. I trained about 6-7 days out of the week. There were at least 4 jiu jitsu training sessions and 1 judo session. In addition to this, I also traveled to other gyms to spar against other jiu jitsu players. It was grueling and I was definitely physically and emotionally exhausted, but I enjoyed every part of it. People were so nice and welcoming, and helped motivate me to push myself to work harder. By the day of the tournament, I was equal parts nervous and excited. There's a change you could lose decisively or win easily - just a matter of who shows up. Luckily, as soon as my first match started I knew I could win. It released all the tension and I performed as I normally would in practice. Afterwards, I won the tournament and felt very happy. It seemed so much easier than I thought it would be. Luckily, I was able to win and will compete again."
