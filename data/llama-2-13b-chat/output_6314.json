        "Summarize the following story in first person: When I had my worst period in my 22 years of age, it was the year that I did not leave the house for more than 8 months. A routine of getting up to watch the roof eat and go back to bed, my self-esteem and consciousness were fragile at that time. With that situation for a person so active in social or sports activities, it was a very strong blow to my lifestyle. My mother at that time offered to serve me in the church, I was not very comfortable with the idea but I had no argument to deny her so I decided to give it a try and enter the production area to learn to put together event lights. From there I began to meet great people who have been every blessing in my life. From that moment on every Sunday I attended to learn faster in my service area, I talked with everyone in the church to meet them in addition to spending my free time simply enjoying the free coffee service. All the activities that the church was attending without hesitation since it wanted to see in its entirety as the community towards its goals and objectives with these activities. as once we went to a hospital after a sharing among all church servers to give our patients time to chronic diseases. Seeing their reactions and their stories was pleasant and makes a difference in your way of thinking towards the world and towards yourself. In addition, the church moved to a new terrain towards which I have been able to witness its growth from 0 to date. which gives me a very strong sense of belonging to the community. In addition to building stronger ties with people and living unique experiences with them while we build a place for those who seek help and peace. To date I am really happy and comfortable and able to solve the problems that life presents. There is still much to solve but I no longer feel anxiety if I don't get excited to see the result of my future actions. No more to add until the next story in the newspaper."
