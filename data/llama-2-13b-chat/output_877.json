        "Summarize the following story in first person: So I started preparing in July for this competition. I was inspired by the new coach at our gym to compete much more frequently. I had also lost fairly decisively at a tournament in February - I needed redemption. I prepared in several different ways. First, I needed to lose about 5 pounds. This takes a good amount of self-discipline, as your body has a hard time readjusting to a caloric deficit. I removed carbs and also just ate less in general, eating a minimum of protein and veggies necessary. I lost about 7 pounds total and was in great shape. My cardio was another issue. I needed to boost my stamina, as in my previous competition I had biked vigorously but still fatigued. My new strategy was to spar at other gyms as often as I could. Fighting someone unfamiliar to you will make you more competitive and more uneasy, which is exactly what a tournament is. The tournament itself was almost disappointing, as it seemed my opponents did not provide enough of a challenge. Who you fight on the day of will always be random. But the lessons I learned in preparation were eye-opening. I came out of this experience a stronger person."
