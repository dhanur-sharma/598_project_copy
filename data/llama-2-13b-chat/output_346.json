        "Summarize the following story in first person: My fourth son was born three months ago. My family and I went to an annual summer party that my neighbor throws. We got home around 9:00 pm and my wife was have some pains. We did not think anything of it as she had been having these pains for the last three weeks. But around 1:00 am the next day her water broke while we were sleeping. We called my in-laws to watch our kids and took her straight to the hospital. She was quickly admitted and taken to a room to deliver our son. We expected a quick labor as it was her fourth child, however it took nearly nineteen hours before he was born. The issue it turns out was he had his umbilical cord wrapped around his body, making it difficult for him to come out. Luckily, he was born healthy and without any complications. We spent the next two days in the hospital. Nurses and doctors came in and out to check on him and run tests throughout our stay. It was a surreal experience and even though I already had been through it three times it was a whirlwind of emotion. It was one of the best days of my life being able to witness the birth on my child. It is something I will never forget for the rest of my life."
