        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was always kind of scatterbrained and this helped me out in the best possible way. 8 weeks ago i was closing up shop and rushing to the bus stop as I usually do otherwise I have to wait another 40 minutes for the bus. I got there and went to swipe my card but couldnt find it. I left my purse on the counter at work with my wallet in it. I must have set it down when I went to pull the gate and didn't pick it back up. So i ran back to the shop and grabbed my purse and started heading back to the bus stop. On the way I realized I forgot to lock up the shop so I had to head back again and lock up. By this point I had for sure missed the bus and wasnt keen on waiting for 40 minutes. I started walking the other direction to see if I could find a different stop that went to the same transfer. As luck would have it there was one that was 20 minutes away, and went to where I needed to go. I sat down on the bench and started to wait. Around 2 minutes after arriving a guy about my age walked up and smiled and stood by the bench waiting for the bus. I saw he had a shirt on for a band I liked and decided to comment. He was telling me about how he flew out to see them in concert 4 weeks ago in california and it was amazing. We talked about music and life and what we were interested in and he actually asked for my number. I gave it to him and he texted me that night asking if i got home safe and if I wanted to grab coffee in the morning. I Agreed and we really hit it off. We've done many things in these short 2 months but it has been amazing!"
