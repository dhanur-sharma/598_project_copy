I didn't know if I could handle speaking with a large volume of customers again. It was really embarrassing. We were on the sales floor and my chest started to get tight. I started to hyperventilate, and the room got small. It seems so silly in hindsight. The floor was hectic and people were talking so loud. I had to leave and take a breather in the bathroom. I was worried about the way that everyone would see me afterwards. I didn't want to be so visible to everyone on just my second day back. I had no idea what to expect. Everything has been good though. Luckily everyone still welcomed me back to the team regardless. I now feel like I belong there again."
