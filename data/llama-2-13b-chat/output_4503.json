        "Summarize the following story in first person: Two months ago my husband and I took a trip for our 25th weeding Anniversary to French Polynesia Islands. We went to 5 of islands of the French Polynesia Islands to be exact. This was such a wonderful trip for me because I had been there 27 years ago and I fell in love with the islands there. Plus, I needed to take a vacation because it had been 3 years since I had took one. I love the water there. It is this beautiful aqua blue that is crystal clear, it shimmers like a gemstone.  The beaches are so magical.  My husband and I spent 12 days there, so we got to so many things.  I truly enjoyed the snorkeling excursion because that is where I got to take my long awaited photos of sharks, and there was so many types.  The photos will always be one of the best memories of this vacation. They are displayed in my house in photo frames for everyone to see because I am so proud of them.  The food was also some of the most unique food I have ever ate. Thanks to guy at the hotel who told my husband to go to this one restaurant because the food was the best on the island of Bora Bora. I had one of the best meals with some of the most fresh vegetables and fruits I have ever had.   I also love the hike we took to the rain forest, that is something you do not see in the western part of Texas I am from.  There is so much to tell about this place but honestly a person needs to go for their self to know what I am talking about. Trust me you will fall in love with this place, I would love to retire here. Nothing better, the beaches, the people, the culture, the food, it is what made me fall in love with this 27 years ago."
