        "Summarize the following story in first person: At the end of May, me, my 2 kids, and my soon to be ex husband moved into my dads house. This was the house I grew up in, and the house my children will spend most of their growing years in. My husband and I were having financial troubles and we knew something had to change soon. My dad graciously agreed to let us move in and make any changes we saw fit. Our current plan is for my husband to look for a new job, one that pays him more than his current job, and save enough money to move out into his own apartment. As you can imagine, this can make for a stressful experience for a few reasons. One, we are divorcing, so we do not always see to eye and seeing each other constantly does not help our situation. Two, in the beginning it was quite rough moving back home to the house I grew up in. I felt like I had failed. Watching all my peers on social media get engaged, get married, buy a house, only added to that feeling. This feeling thankfully, did not last long. I now feel like this is my house, and I am happy to give my kids some stability, rather than moving apartments every few years. I did not realize how much of an effect moving had on me or my older son until one day shortly after we moved he made me promise that we wouldn't move again. Now more than ever, stability is important to me. That was probably one of the most surprising parts of the move, how it affected him, and how for the first time I felt like I had truly failed on my end as a parent to provide him with a stable home. The second part was feeling how I had failed as an adult by not being able to live on my own like I \"should\". Living with my dad again has some perks, like he is always around to babysit, and there are drawbacks as well. He is not the cleanest person and so that is frustrating. We all share one bathroom, and that is also something that we all had to adjust too as well. We have now been here for almost 4 months and I would say the benefits definitely outweigh the drawbacks at this point."
