        "Summarize the following story in first person: I often leave the garage door open while I am working outside or working in the garage. My 15-year old cat will wander outside and sit in the sun. He is getting older, but he is still spry enough to occasionally chase a squirrel. Well, I did not know Kitty-Kat was outside when I went to close the garage door. It is a heavy door, so I normally give it a little nudge and the thing will slam shut the rest of the way all by itself. I was totally aghast to see Kitty-Kat try to duck under the door just as it fell onto his neck. He could not even breath! I immediately opened the door enough to let him get up and come in. He wobbled a bit, but then he settled down onto a blanket I keep on the floor for him. Well, two weeks later, and Kitty-Kat was obviously in some distress. I remembered back to the garage door nearly strangling him. I scooped him up and ran to the vet's emergency room. I explained what happened. They took over, performing multiple tests on him. I know that the veterinarians did the best they could do under the circumstances, but they admitted that there were no medical procedures that would help my cat. They sent me home with some pain killers for him. That evening, my Kitty-Kat died. He was already old and had lived a long, eventful life. However, I still wailed out loud. My kitty was gone forever. I still miss him."
