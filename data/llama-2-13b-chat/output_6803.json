        "Summarize the following story in first person: I decided to do the Naked Bike Ride in Chicago this last June.  About two weeks prior to the ride I told a friend that I was going to do it someday.  She blew it off as a \"someday, yeah right\" moment.  The day before the ride, I was supposed to go on a date and the woman at the very last moment cancelled on me... again.  She said she'd make it up to me the next day.  Rather than say \"yeah, no problem\" I went with \"I'm going to busy, I'm going to be naked on a bike in Chicago tomorrow.\"  She scoffed and thought I was joking.  That was when I decided, I was going to actually do it.I have a hybrid mountain bike that I use for easy trails around Illinois and pulled it out of my garage.  Checked it out by going for a ride around the lakes near my house.  During the ride, I saw a couple that I knew and we stopped and talked a few minutes.  They told me that they we also planning on going to bike.  Small talk, said hope to see them there and I continued my ride around the lake.Next morning, day of the ride, the woman I was supposed to go on the date with the previous evening text me \"Hey, are you mad at me? Call me\". Conversation ensued as to what my plans were for the night.  She then asked \"are you mad at me?\"  I responded with \"No. Can't be really be mad a mosquito when it's just following its natural instincts.\" She hung up.I get down to the park where we're supposed to meet at the \"secret\" location.  I get routed to a warehouse where there's about 100 riders all in various states of dress.  Looking around, I realize I didn't bring my water bottle.  I'd left it in my car, I realize I had only parked about a 3 minute ride from it and went back.  On the return trip to the rider assembly area, I see a gorgeous woman taking out her bike from the back of her car.  In passing I tell her that the staging area is this way.  The reason I tell her this is that the \"secret\" meeting location is about 1/2 a mile in the other direction. That's how I met my new girlfriend."

We rode from the West side of Chicago to the North side.  We passed through some of the seedier parts of town, but the group was great and the police escort we had was fantastic.  They blocked traffic for us, let us go through red lights and did everything they could to keep us safe.  I have to say that it was a great time. I rode naked on a bike in Chicago and lived to tell the tale.  The only thing that could have made it better would have been if the woman that I met before the ride had been there.  She was a no show, but that's another story."
