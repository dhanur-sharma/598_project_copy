        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 3 months ago, I sneaked out of the house after dinner for a lonely cigarette. I was in my pajamas and house slipper. I finished my smoke, grounded the bud and was about to go into house. when i slipped on something and hit the nearby lamp and landed hard on the pavement. It was a cold night and there was not anyone around. My best chances of surviving were to reach my home. I was down on the pavement and hidden from view by a car. I was not able to get up. I could not move or make any noise. I felt blood oozing from the back of my head, where it hit the paver block. i felt blood on both sides, presumable from when I had hit myself twice during my fall. With every passing minute, my survival was becoming questionable. I was worried that I will pass out and bleed to death.  I was thinking who will be coming around the street, at this hour? There was another thought in my mind, if anyone in my family would miss me at home? Will someone from my family will come looking for me? My kids will be be hooked on to the wifi and glued to their smart screens, ipad or laptop or mobiles. My wife will be busy doing the dishes and getting things ready for a swift morning departure to school and office. She may realize I was missing after another 60 or 90 or minutes. This made me to wonder, will I be around after 60 or 90 minutes? I couldn't remember anything after this. I was after a long time when I felt a tug and someone was lifting me up. some sort of bandage was on my neck, it was causing pain and restricting my head movements."

She was worried that I may have fallen and hit my head. She found me down, bleeding, unconscious and freezing. She called the ambulance. I was taken to the hospital. I was unconscious for 3 days. I was operated on for a bleeding in my brain. I was in the hospital for 2 weeks. I was lucky to survive."
