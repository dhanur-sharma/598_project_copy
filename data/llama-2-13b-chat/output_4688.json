        "Summarize the following story in first person: Several months ago I was released from my company for a violation of company policy.  I was well aware of what I was doing at the time I knew that it could lead to my firing.  However I was so unhappy with where I was working I was not at all concerned about the potential ramifications.  Eventually I got caught doing this thing I knew I shouldn't be doing and I was let go.  At this point I felt an extreme amount of shame and embarrassment because I knew from day 1 I shouldn't have done this.  I was forced to go home and tell my family that I had been fired.  I spent several months looking for a new position.  I had no idea what was going to take place. I didn't know if the real reason I was fired would come out and it would impact my future employment.  After several months of stress and anxiety of being out of work I was able to find a job.  I was forced into a significant pay cut and I had to impose further stress on my family to tighten our budget.  In the long run I ended up at a job I am happy with however we needed some significant changes to our lifestyle to stay on budget. However in the long run I ended up not at a company that made me miserable and treated me like dog meat, and I was able to find a large measure of happiness at my new position.  It just went to show me that if you are that unhappy at a business you need to leave.  Additionally I learned money isn't everything as I am much happier making less."
