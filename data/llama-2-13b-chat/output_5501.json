        "Summarize the following story in first person: It has been a stressful couple of months. I have been more anxious to go outside and do the things that I used to like doing. I have noticed that it is starting to affect my daughter. It kills me that my anxiety is having this effect on her. About 3 weeks ago I noticed that my anxiety would get really bad when I would drop my daughter off at school. Around this time she started to not act like her happy self and she started to detach herself from her friends.  She used to go out with her friends about every weekend and then a couple of days after school to work on homework.  Three weeks ago I noticed she wasn't doing this as often and she was staying home to make sure that I was okay. I decided that I needed to do something to change the situation. I needed to do it for her and for me. I decided to reach out for help. I called the family member in and asked what they thought I should do. They suggested I talk to a therapist. I called one up and immediately started seeing her. I was put on medication and started to feel better. I would go out with my daughter more and make myself face my fears. I encouraged her to hang out with her friends again and she has started to do so again. Everything is looking better now."
