        "Summarize the following story in first person: I always wanted to go to Peace Corps. I had one friend ask me what makes me think that I will get into Peace Corps.  He said that he had friends that didnt get in.  The implication is that his friends were better qualified than me to get in and they didn't.  Therefore, I would not get in.  It was true that I had some setbacks in my life.  I had sufferred from depression and college was a little rough.  However, I now saw the light at the end of the tunnel.  I don't know exactly why I wanted to go to peace corps.  After all, it is kind of a crazy thing to do.  But I remember that the first time I spoke of it was to my ex boyfriend.  He looked at me like I was crazy.  Of course, I kind of was crazy so I get that he thought that this was just one more crazy thing.  I worry that his reaction was what made me want to do it even more, but I don't think so.  I think it was really because I started to love travel.  Travel became addicting.  And it was a challenge.  And, hell ya.  I did it.  i got accepted and it changed my life."
