        "Summarize the following story in first person: I went to Grandmas birthday party last month. My uncles and aunts were there. All my nieces and nephews were also there. Grandma was happy and in a good mood.  She was glad to see everyone gathered together. We had a great time. We told stories about past events in our lives. we talked about trips we had taken when we were young. We had great food that we all brought. Grandma made some food also. We had a huge birthday cake for her. We loved being together. we dont get to be together that often anymore. We all plan to get together for the holiday season. Hopefully we can all have a party again. We plan to do so for Christmas. And we want to get together for a big cookout Memorial day. Everyone was making suggestions on how to get the family together more often. It makes me think how little time we spend together. I hope we can change that because life is short and should be enjoyed."
