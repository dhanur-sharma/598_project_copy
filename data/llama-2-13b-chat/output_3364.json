        "Summarize the following story in first person: Honestly, one of the most memorable events in my life recently was the day of my wedding. This was nearly 4 months ago, and is still pretty fresh in my mind. It was a pretty good day, which started bright and early at 7 am for me and my friends. I had to get to the hair salon at 8am to get ready for hair and makeup. My friends were all tired, and I was as well. Mostly because I was super anxious and ready to get married finally. But it all went smoothly, and we were done in about 3 hours. We still had time to kill, so we went to grab lunch nearby. Then shortly after that we got ready to head to the church to finish getting ready for the wedding. Now that part was chaotic. My dad lost or misplaced parts of his suit rental. And, my dress which had fit previously the week before, was not closing up properly. Go figure, I ended up having to be sewed into my dress. Then it came time to get married finally. And all of the stress and anxiety went away the moment I saw my husband finally. It went very smoothly, even though our friend dropped our wedding rings. We said our vows and all that. And then after the ceremony was over we headed to the after party. There are alot of cherished memories that come along with that day. And, I'll never forget it."
