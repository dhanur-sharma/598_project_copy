I was there with her at the hospital throughout the entire ordeal. I drove her there after a frantic call from her at 2:00 in the morning. I held her hand and tried to comfort her as much as possible. The doctors tried desperately to save his lilttle life, but just could not. The baby was stillborn two months premature. We are all struggling now to get through this tough emotionaly time. We are taking each day at a time. My daughter has been going to therapy three days a week. This has helped her a great deal. We talk every day. My poor little baby girl is just awestruck that this happened to her. She was so excited for her baby to arrive."
