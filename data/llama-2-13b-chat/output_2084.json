        "Summarize the following story in first person: I totally forgot to tell you about my finger! About 3 months ago, I was in the kitchen cutting some fresh veggies. I was going to make some salad and put tomatoes and things in it. Well, I was talking to my husband and wasn't paying attention. I mean, I've cut countless tomatoes and other things and never had a problem! I just slipped and cut the tip of my finger clear off! I was screaming and holding my hand up while blood poured from my tip. My husband grabbed a towel and told my daughter to go get the phone and call an ambulance. I was screaming 'IS THAT NEEDED?\" and my husband picked up my tip of finger and told me \"YES!\" A few minutes later, the ambulance came and took the tip that I had cut off and I was off to the hospital. What a time! I couldn't believe that I was so careless to let something like that happen to me. They were able to put the finger tip back on, sadly it's a little deformed. I don't really mind, just the fact that I have an intact finger is enough for me to be honest! I just couldn't believe how supportive and caring my family and my neighbors were. Sure, we all shared our jokes, but they were coming and helping me all the time."
