        "Summarize the following story in first person: Ordinarily, I'm not a fan of watching animals. But since my boyfriend suggested that we go to Busch Gardens for a safari, things have really changed. It's hard to imagine how that moment of magic could change my entire perspective of watching animals. I used to fear going close to animals, but not only did I get close to giraffes on that safari, but I also fed them. I just couldn't believe how wonderful that experience turned out to be. In the subsequent days, I've continued remembering that experience. It's like those giraffes depend on me to be comfortable. I would really love to go back. I just can't sit on these memories without reliving them again. I look forward to the day when I will see and feed my beloved giraffes. The good thing is that my boyfriend is an outgoing person. He loves to go to watch animals, and I think he just got himself a good companion. Come this weekend, I will be the first one to propose going to watch animals. I intend to carry goodies to my hosts. I believe when they see me they will be happy. And I will be happy to serve them"
