        "Summarize the following story in first person: My best friend and I had a serious argument. We spent quite a bit of time apart, angry at one another. At least, I was angry at her. I don't know if she was angry at me, because she wrote me a message recently. Actually, she tried to call me a few times and then wrote a message asking me if I was alright. I wrote back and let her know that I'm feeling alright. We talked for quiet a while and she did her best to mitigate any angry feelings we may have between us. We talked about the time that we have been apart and we even touched on the fact that we had disagreed at one point. We didn't talk, at all, about the situation that led to the hurt feelings in the first place. Instead, we talked about what we intend to do going forward. We talked as though we are going forward separately, not together. She was very nice about the whole thing, and didn't say anything nasty. I didn't say anything nasty either. We both just talked as though nothing had ever happened. We talked as though we were no longer friends, but that we now have a history together. We talked like we knew each other very well. I don't know if that was a good thing or a bad thing, but I know that it was some kind of an evolution in our relationship. We now operate as two separate individuals, not nearly as close as before, but with a history that binds us together. Throughout the conversation, I kept trying to find some common ground. I desperately wanted to feel as though I were as close to her as I once was. She didn't reciprocate on that. She made a point to tell me that she still considers me a 'good friend' but never offered any new personal conversation that would support that idea. Instead, she made a point to ask me some very general questions, being careful not to get too personal or specific. She didn't ask anything specific, but I could tell that she cared how I was doing. That made if fell like there is hope that we can still be friends."
