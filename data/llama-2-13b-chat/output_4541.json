        "Summarize the following story in first person: I tried to sell a house before it went into foreclosure, but it sat so long that the lawyer's fees became too steep, and I was no longer able to afford the payoff.  Someone put it an offer, but it was too late.  I had no choice but to let it turn into a Sheriff's sale.  It was frustrating, because I put a ton of time, money and energy into making it appealing for sale.  Despite it being looked at many times, no one put in a serious offer.  For month, I paid two households, but couldn't keep affording it.  It was only after not paying for over half a year, foreclosure starting, and lawyers fees getting stacked on the mortgage, that someone finally put in an offer.  By then, it was too late.  There was an annoying moment a few months before that were someone put in a good offer.  There were no lawyer fees at the time, and it would have been affordable.  The bank didn't do its job correctly.  They approved the buyer for a loan, and only after going through a month of negotiations did they look into their employment.  It turned out they didn't have a job, and couldn't get the loan.  I'd already spent a bunch of money getting utilities turned back on for inspection, so that was even more money down the drain.  Just one more annoying footnote in a long streak of bad luck."
