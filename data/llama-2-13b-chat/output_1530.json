        "Summarize the following story in first person: 3 months ago, right after graduation from collage, my boyfriend and I decided to take some time off from all the hard work we have done in the last 4 years and tour Southwest states. We figured, if not now, then when? When we get married? When we have kids and jobs and other responsibilities? If there was a time to do this, it is now. We packed out small Honda and with minimal planning went on our great adventure! And it was amazing! We set out to check out this great county and it's amazing vastness and natural beauty. Main goal of our trip was to hit every national state park we could but also visit major cities and hit their night scene and experience their culture and cuisine. We started in Missouri, our home state, and handed west, through Kansas, Colorado and Utah util we hit the Pacific coast in California. I always wanted to dip my toes into the Pacific Ocean and now I finally had a chance. We took some scuba lessons and enjoyed our time in Santa Barbara. We were also amazed by California's red forests! You can believe it until you see it! The size and majesty of those trees will always remain ingrained in my mind. After spending some time in CA, we circled back to Arizona to visit the Grand canyon. I am not afraid of heights but my boyfriend is, so needless to say, I had great time but on the other hand, he really didn't . From Arizona we headed east to New Mexico and , of course, we had to check out what all this hoopla was about area 51.  It's amazing how much business is devoted to \"little green man\" in here. Although we don't believe in conspiracy theories regarding alien abductions and such, we had to get souvenirs and gift for out friends. Our time on the road was almost over and we continued east through parts of Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas and finally back to Missouri. I must admit, after all this time spend sleeping in the camp sites or cheap motels I was so happy to finally get a great night sleep at my own bed! I don't regret going on this trip, it was mind blowing and exciting but after awhile you just want to rest a bit and take it all in."
