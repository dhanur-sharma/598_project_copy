        "Summarize the following story in first person: I recently reconnected with a former love of mine. We had a falling out a very long time ago, and recently ran into each other at the neighborhood Raley's. She just moved back into the city a few months ago. It was very surprising to me that I ran into her. She has really beautiful blue eyes, but my favorite part about her is her personality. I'm usually not too great with jokes, but she tends to laugh at most of my dumb ones. We have both changed very much, but it was for the better. Now that we have reconnected I'm feeling better then ever. We went out to the movies last week, and got some dinner after. The resturaunt we went to was right down the street at Tahoe Joe's. I got whiskey peppercorn chicken, and she got a fancy salad of some kind. We went back to my place and started watching amazon's new show the boys. We really enjoyed it (or at least I think she did). It was very memorable, and I hope to have more memories like this in the future. So far, It's going great, and I hope it can only get better!"
