        "Summarize the following story in first person: This event was what I like to call the great wake up call. i was on fast track to not caring about life and giving up. i thought it was all rigged and was not worth fighting for anymore When i got hit by the train and lived. i realized I had a purpose. I went to school and now make 6 figures. I got two kids and a wife. i take care of two parents with dementia. I have land with a ton of animals i am responsible for. What is odd is if I would have dies all of thier lives would have been changed forever. None of this would have occurred. My son would have never been born my daughter would have grew up without a dad. My parents would be in a nursing home.  The animals I adopted would still be abused or put down. The volunteer hours I put in would not be done. You learn to think about life and what is important. I still cross these tracks and I get scared for a second I can feel the pain of being hit and know it hurt. But to walk away with out a scratch and see how life is really is well worth it. I would not encourage others to fo it but I consider it a gift of sight."
