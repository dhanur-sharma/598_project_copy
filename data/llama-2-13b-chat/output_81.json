        "Summarize the following story in first person: My girlfriend and I had decided to break up. We had a rough patch in our relationship and things looked like they couldn't get any better. We had tried to work things out, but in the end it wasn't going to work. I had decided to move out of the apartment a few weeks after we decided to split. She didn't want me to do that since she would have some issues paying for the rent. I told her I had to move for my own sanity. Being in a home with her, especially after how we broke up wasn't healthy for either of us. I started to pack my things and leave. She told me that she'd help me move my things. I was thankful for the help. Until I realized that she was tossing all my things onto the ground outside. I was so upset with her and she didn't care. She wasn't happy with me leaving at all. She kept screaming about how I was doing her wrong in this whole thing. I did her wrong? Was she serious? I guess so. When I finished packing, I told her bye and she cussed me out."
