        "Summarize the following story in first person: I started a online business a month ago but did not customers till a week. One of my friend suggested me to start the marketing campaign on social media. I started marketing about my online business three weeks ago. After the marketing of 3 weeks my clients base have increased in a very numerous ways. I was surprised in the initial stage as just after marketing for 3 weeks the way my clients lists started to increase was really great. I am really thankful for my friend as he suggested me the great idea about the marketing about my online business. The gain of my clients list have also given some worries too. I am happy that i have achieved the clients list i wanted but i am also worried about the pace of growth. I have already found my self very busy with the current clients list. If it goes further i am worried that i can still give the best services for all my clients. I want to give the best service to all my clients that is why i am worried about. The marketing is still going on, I will get more clients as well. But when it comes to service will i be able to keep up is the question on my mind always. I am a hardworking person. Hopefully i can give the best service to all my clients."
