        "Summarize the following story in first person: I would like to describe an event which happened to me recently in achieving my career goals i.e my promotion. It happened recently 6 months ago. I felt very happy for being compensated for my hard work. By this promotion I am very much motivated to hard work and achieve more and more success in my career. A great skill is the ability to foresee all or at least most of these goals at the moment of the initial career planning in order not to set tasks that one can't cope with it. Individual planning of a business career usually includes a number of steps:1. Collection of personal information. 2. Evaluation of desires and opportunities to achieve high professional status within a particular organization. 3. Formulation of personal career goals. 4. Development of strategies,plans and behavior aimed at achieving the stated goals. Of course , it is difficult to talk about the distant future. One should read magazines related to their profession. An employee who want to achieve career goals should also attain training events and special courses related to their profession."
