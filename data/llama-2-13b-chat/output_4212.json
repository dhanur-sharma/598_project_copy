        "Summarize the following story in first person: This year is the 5th anniversary of the death of my cousin whom I was very close with. She was 30 years old when she passed away suddenly. She passed away only 4 months after our grandmother passed away. So her mom (my aunt) not only lost her mother but also lost her only child all within a few months. My aunt was trying her best to keep her head above water and grieve in her own time and way but she completely let grief take her over. I had been witnessing a steady decline in her mental health the past few years and her behavior getting more erratic and manic and suspected that she was self-medicating. This became clear around Christmas time this year when she was staying with our family for the holiday and she was inebriated so much that she did not realize that she had accidentally turned on the gas on the gas stove in the middle of the night. Luckily my brother smelled the gas and remedied the situation. So that incident told me that she was not doing well at all. Then a couple of months later in the spring she had a complete mental break. Which in a way was what she needed I think, as much as it pained me to see her like this. I think she finally needed to break and hit rock bottom and scare herself to realize how much she had not been dealing with her grief. We had long talks about this, she and I, and she admits that she had not actually been dealing with her grief even though she thought she was and doing it to the best of her ability. We started sharing our travels of grief and I confided in her that I had gone to grief therapy, which she knew was a huge step for me because I have been against myself (only myself) going to therapy since I was made to go to family counseling against my will when I was younger. I told her how angry I had become after losing both my grandmother and my cousin and that anger was how grief had manifested in me. I also told her that it was OK to let grief in even though it is so painful. The more you push it down the worse it will be to overcome later. She worked hard to pull herself up to a \"standing position\" and is since doing much better and has found a great community to support her and seems to be getting back on her feet."
