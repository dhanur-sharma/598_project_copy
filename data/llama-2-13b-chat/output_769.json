        "Summarize the following story in first person: So guess what I did? In early November, I went ahead and bought that Virtual Reality set that I've been dying to get. It was on a pre-Christmas sale, and you know I never buy myself anything expensive. I've just been looking into them and they seem like fun and what's the point of working if you never get to buy fun stuff? I just got to show it to my family. Regina loves it and Ben is obsessed! He's definitely going to go get one now. It's not quite worth as much as I paid for it, because I think it's a bit of a dad and I'll probably get tired of it soon. I mean, it's great for watching movies! Fun for video games too. Other than that, I can't believe I purchased it. I'm getting buyer's remorse thinking about it. I did get it on sale though. Now I'm trying to justify spending the money. I bought it 2 month s ago, so I can't take it back now. I always do this...punish myself for buying anything."
