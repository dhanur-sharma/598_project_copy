        "Summarize the following story in first person: Several months ago, I proposed to my girlfriend. It was during a walk. Walks are something we both enjoy, and it\u2019s when I asked her to take a walk after dinner one evening that she realized that she loved me. I thought it was the perfect thing. It\u2019s simple, yet personal. It\u2019s us. It was a warm fall afternoon. We took a walk around the neighborhood. It\u2019s not a fancy route, but it\u2019s one we both enjoy. She was thrilled. I was thrilled. She said yes without hesitation. The decision to propose to her in the first place was a no-brainer. I\u2019ve loved her for a long time, and I couldn\u2019t imagine my life with anybody else. I\u2019ve never had any doubts about her. She\u2019s who I want to spend the rest of my life with."
