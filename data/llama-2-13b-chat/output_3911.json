        "Summarize the following story in first person: My husband and I went through a difficult time over nine months ago, probably closer to a year ago.  Prior to that, the owner of the company I worked for had made the decision to shut down the business where I had worked at for about five years.  As it was a family run small business where I was the only employee, I was not offered any kind of severance benefits. I was only informed that they would give me a month's notice before they closed down the business. As it was, I was unemployed for a good six months. It was unfortunate that during this time my husband hurt himself while working his restaurant job. He had to have a hernia surgery and had to recover for a good two weeks.  During this time he was not allowed any physical activity and could not work. At this time, I was collecting unemployment benefits, our only source of income, which did not remotely cover our monthly expenses and rent.  We had virtually no savings, and had mounting debt.  My husband and I both grew depressed and started to get into arguments over the smallest things, like the fact that his smoking habit was making a dent in my meager unemployment benefits, or my not wanting to get out of bed and look for employment because I was depressed.  However, as my unemployment benefit was set to run out, I had no choice but to go out and look for employment, even if it paid minimum wage and inconvenient hours.  I was scouring employment websites and Craigslist for hours every day looking for jobs that I had no interest in just so that I could put food on the table.  I was discouraged because I did not get any calls, emails or applications returned while I was coming closer and closer to maxing out my unemployment benefits. It was not look good for us.  Finally though, I managed to get a part-time job as a receptionist for a debt collector, a job which I hated and lasted at for three weeks before I managed to interview for a logistics job which I got and have stayed at to this day."
