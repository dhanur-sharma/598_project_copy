        "Summarize the following story in first person: I have struggled to tell my family about the gospel. It is not that I don't want to. It is just because they are not receptive to it. I know I cannot shove it down their throats because they will build a wall so quick to block it out. I have to be more subtle about it. When I took my niece shopping a few months back, she brought up something that was from the bible. She was not having a biblical conversation, but she did have to mention a certain custom that was found in the bible. Naturally, she took a worldly view of it rather than read the entire book to understand the context. I was able to explain what the snippet she shared actually meant. She rarely listens when I am able to share something with her like this, but she was the one who brought it up so I did have her attention. It was like only climbing a foot up a 1,000 foot wall as far as progress goes, but this was much better than declining, which is usually what happens. I hope to have more chances in the future, but I know they will be hard to find. I am encouraged though by this. It means that she will be open once again to hear the gospel since she was this time. I just hope that I can get the rest of the family, and her, on board!"
