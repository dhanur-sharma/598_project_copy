        "Summarize the following story in first person: One month ago, I wasn't feeling well. My stomach hurt constantly, and after work my feet hurt as well. I was constantly out of breath and climbing stairs became a huge challenge for me. I was also urinating a lot. My life was completely miserable and I didn't see any end in site. I tried some multi vitamin supplements from the local grocery store, but they didn't seem to help. I tried to get expensive insoles for my shoes but they didn't seem to help. After a 4 months of this, I finally went to to my family doctor. She ordered some lab work. When the results came back, she asked me to see her in her office. I went in on a Tuesday morning. The doctor sat down with me and explained that I was pre-diabetic and obese. She told me that I need to lose at least 90 pounds and keep it off to put myself back in a healthy weight range to possibly reverse the adverse health problems that had been caused by my overeating and inactive habits. Since then, I have switched to a low carbohydrate diet that has a focus of protein and vegetables. I also started going for 40 minute walks everyday. I have lost 15 pounds and feel so much more energized. I look forward to my continued progress."
