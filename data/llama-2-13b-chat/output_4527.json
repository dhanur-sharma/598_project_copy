        "Summarize the following story in first person: Today my granddaughter turned 4 months old. It was a small but important milestone for me. We celebrated by having pizza over at my daughters house. I know it seems silly to celebrate every month but we are all still so happy she is here and healthy. I remember 4 months ago like it was yesterday. I was in Bali enjoying a vacation with my friends when I got a call from my son in law. My daughter had gone into labor very unexpectedly. She was only 28 weeks pregnant and something had caused her to go into pre-term labor. I don't remember how I did it but I managed to get to the airport and on a plane within a few hours. The flight was long and I had no cell phone service the entire way, I have never been so scared in my entire life. Once I landed and turned my cell phone on I had probably 30 text messages and missed calls, the baby had been born. She was healthy! I don't think I'd ever felt such relief in my entire life. I will always remember that day and how close I felt to possibly losing my little granddaughter. I guess that is why I want to celebrate every tiny milestone she reaches. 4 months ago we really thought we might never be celebrating any birthdays, and so even the monthly ones are important."
