        "Summarize the following story in first person: In my life, a grey area is something that holds true in many aspects. A few months back my favorite cousin was sent back to jail. Sadly he tested dirty we went to his parole officer. What made matters worse was that his home was swatted and they found quite a bit of different drugs there as well. I live in a small town so of course this was in newspaper and featured the sheriff County's facebook page. There were a lot of negative comments stating that he was a horrible person and deserves jail time you name it they were saying it. But I know I love my cousin and things are just so black and white, if people kept open mind even know that he had a very rough child without a father and he got with the wrong crowd. When he got married 5 years ago he was clean and doing so well but there was a fire at his home and he had to jump out of a second-story when after saving his kids and wife. Because of this he hurt his back and got addicted to painkillers. And he started to smoke weed and two other drugs to take away his pain and progressing depression. I suppose if I didn't know the specifics behind it it would see my cousin. As a good or bad person (ie) a black or white mentality of his character. But most things in this life there's always two sides to every story which gives way to gray areas of life. I just wish more people saw the world this way. Perhaps the world would be a better place if we all did."
