After having fun for an hour or so. we continued our journey to the forest we laughed. sang and did crazy stuff all along the road until we reached the forest we planned everything. from setting up the camps and campfire to the marshmallows. It was the craziest night we had and I still remember it so much fun and so much happiness. so next day after getting a good night nap. we gathered around thinking about the game we wanted to play. after that, we played a game. the game was about courage. you have to eat a mushroom. the mushroom Jack found was hallucinating one. we didn't know about that though."
