        "Summarize the following story in first person: Today I was thinking back to mom's birthday. It was about five weeks ago now, but it still brings a smile to my face when I think about it.  I still can't believe that we pulled off the surprise party! Things got a little sketchy when she said she wan't really feeling like going  out to dinner, but they came full circle when I worked my puppy dog eye magic and she went any way. I still got it. When we got to our usual restaurant we walked in as usual but the hostess said they were expecting a large party so we'd have to sit in the back side of the restaurant. When we turned the corner - BAM - there was the whole family, just for mom! It was awesome to see the love that we all have for her and for her to be the star of the show for once. Her face was glowing and so were ours. We spent hours together at the restaurant with everyone that we love and then they brought the cake out... mom's favorite too. Ice cream cake! That's when the tears started flowing. She whispered in my ear that she never had a party for herself. She was always the one throwing parties. So needless to stay the tears poured down my face right along with her. Man do I love this woman. I can only hope to be half the woman she is."
