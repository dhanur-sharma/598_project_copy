        "Summarize the following story in first person: I was taking my old boy Jake for a walk at the park. He's an Australian Shepherd, 14 years old, and just the goodest, kindest boy. I try to take him early in the mornings when it's quiet, because something from his past makes him nervous around other dogs. Unfortunately, there happened to be someone else there, someone who didn't realize we were, and had left their young dog off leash to run around. It's not legal, though I can understand energetic dogs do need lots of exercise. The pup sprinted to us, eager to play with Jake, tail wagging, barking and bouncing. Jake wasn't very pleased with the sudden stranger, a ball of noise and energy, running up to us uninvited. As the owner ran over, shouting his dog's name, Jake grumbled at the puppy. The younger dog did not like Jake's defensive nature, and barking escalated between them. Eventually, the pup got too close, and Jake lunged for the bite. Once dogs start fighting, it is impossible to deter them. No amount of yelling, throwing water, or pulling on the leash will snap them out of it. We both had to grab our dogs by the midsections, lift their hind legs and drag them away from each other between bites. Luckily, there were no wounds, only trails of saliva and continued barking. \"Nice dog,\" the man said to me sarcastically as he dragged his puppy away, trying to finally affix his leash. I know it shouldn't have hurt, I know it was a throwaway comment from an idiot of a stranger, but those words wounded me. Jake was only protecting me, protecting himself from what he perceived to be an unwanted intruder. He's been through abandonment and attack, and despite being a big, black, old dog, the very stereotype of the \"mean dog,\" he made it through the animal shelter system, and into my home where he's been a dear and loyal friend. I don't care what anyone else thinks. Jake IS a nice dog."
