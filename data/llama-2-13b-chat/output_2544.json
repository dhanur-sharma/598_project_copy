        "Summarize the following story in first person: My work enviroment has changed for the worst. I find myself disconnected with everything around me. I am able to be productive and get my job done when there aren't people around me judging me, mocking me or just plain making fun of me. I am fed up but keep bringing myself to make peace with everything around me. I don't know who benefits from this or who loses, but I hope I can't stop thinking about this in black and white. There is good in evil and there is evil in good.  Everything is a balance and I got to balance myself. The body and the mind know what's best for them, so listen to them.  But what do I know? In the end I am still insecure and my words won't matter unless I make them to. I care about my peers but lately I been carring more about myself.. Grown man and women make mistakes Taking care of grown man and women doesnt mean give them money. it means give them hope. or mativation.  I get angry but need to step aside and realize eveything is not about me. I need to balace myself between the good and the evil."
