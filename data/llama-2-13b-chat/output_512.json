        "Summarize the following story in first person: I planned my retirement a year in advance after I gave my notice at my place of employment that I was ready to retire. Everyone at work was sad to see me go and I knew it was going to be tough leaving work because I had developed special bonds with many coworkers since I had a couple of decades working there. I thought it was going to be tough spending more time at home than at work and that eventually I would get bored and want to go back to work, so I left my position with the option of coming back if I had ever decided to. As five months have passed since my retirement I never thought I would be enjoying living my life without the pressures of the job I loved doing for so many years. I am truly enjoying every moment of my retirement and I don't plan on doing any work for the time present. I love that I am able to see my granddaughter grow up and give her the time I always wanted to but previously was so busy to do. We have the greatest time together because she such a sweet little girl and I have had the opportunity to care for her four days out of the week while her parents work. I am also able to do that for my daughter so she could go to work knowing that her daughter is in the best hands. I love my life right now and I would not trade it for nothing. I also was able to pick up my old hobby of painting and this all happened just one afternoon when I was cleaning out my attic and I found all of my old paintings. I relived the joy I had as I painted them as an adolescent and I decided I would pick up the hobby once more. It was tough to get back into it but once I had started painting again, I rediscovered why I loved it so much. I am even teaching my granddaughter to paint and she loves it also. It is a great bonding time with her that I would not have had if I had not retired. I truly feel as if I am living my life as I should at this moment and I do not regret my decision to retire as difficult as it was in the beginning since I am so used to be active. I like the moments I am living with my family, I like that I am able to slow down, I like to know that I have the world as my oyster and most importantly I like to know that I am developing so many memories with all of my loved ones."
