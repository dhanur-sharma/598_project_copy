        "Summarize the following story in first person: Graduation is a time to celebrate achievement. It is the end of a chapter in life and the beginning of another chapter. While I was glad my studies were finished, I felt saddened that this part of my life was over. If someone would have told me freshman year that I would feel this way come graduation day, I would have called them crazy. But here it was, graduation made me sad. I didn't even pick up my cap and gown because I knew that I would not attend. I wasn't sure about the next step in my life or what all of my work really meant. It didn't feel like much of a celebration. A classmate sent some of the photos her and her family took of graduation. I looked at the picture of her in between her parents. There was another picture of the football field, full of chairs and the crowd looking out at the graduates. As much as I am happy for her, I wanted to forget about school. I felt alone because everyone else was so happy. She wasn't the only classmate that reached out to me. I heard from a guy I took English Composition with and my roommate from sophomore year. My former roommate told me about the night that she wanted to drop out of everything. She said that if I hadn't been there to support her, things would be different not only for her, but her family. I got several texts from senior seminar classmates thanking me for being a great team member, for helping them study. I am glad that I could avail myself to so many people and that something I did mattered.  Still, I did not regret my decision to attend graduation and that this part of my life is over."
