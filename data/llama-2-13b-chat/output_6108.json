        "Summarize the following story in first person: In a few more weeks, I'll have to start round two of seeing my ex-husband in court. I know I went away from the previous time feeling okay about it all, relief, I guess, but as it gets closer to this next round, I'm getting nervous again. I guess I just wish it would end. I wish he would do what he's supposed to do and stop trying so hard to bankrupt me. He wants to see our children in a setting that won't require supervision, but he abandoned them almost two years ago, which is why the order was set in place. We were both interviewed by a social worker, and she told me in no uncertain terms that she would fall on the floor dead if he was given unrestricted visits to our children. This does set my mind at ease, but having to re-live everything I've gone through with him was probably even more difficult than seeing him for the first time in a year and a half. I guess this isn't really re-telling the first experience, so much as re-reflecting on it leading up to the new situation concerning it, but I am still a little nervous. I think the relief comes from knowing he can't personally hurt me anymore, but he does have the potential to hurt my children. Initially, seeing him for the first time was certainly going to bring about nervous feelings, but as time goes by and I realize it's not done, the anger and nervousness that had subsided is turning quickly back to square one. Knowing that our children fear him and don't want to see him makes me worry about the effect this is going to have on them. They're in therapy, but how will it help them once they inevitably have to spend time with him? Will he ultimately disown them if the magistrate decides to hold the original order? I really don't know, and not knowing is where I am now instead of feeling relief. I really don't know if I will ever feel relief unless he gets help or is out of our lives for good."
