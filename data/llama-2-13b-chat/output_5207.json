        "Summarize the following story in first person: In the middle of August, I took a trip to Kentucky for a memorial service for a dear friend, J.  He had killed himself in May of this year. I wasn't able to make it to his funeral, but I made it to the memorial in August.   I hadn't seen a lot of my Kentucky friends in about 6 years, so it was bittersweet.  I got to see so many loved ones and family (family by choice, not blood), yet it was odd because J wasn't there.  It felt surreal to be with my KY family and him not being there.  We all got together one weekend and spend the weekend camping at another friend's house and drinking bourbon and moonshine and telling J stories.  It was so important, because once someone is gone, memories and stories are all we have of them.  He was like a brother to all of us, so his death hit our little circle of friends hard.  Being able to be with all of them and grieve with all of them helped me feel better than I had in months.  I also went and spent some time with J's mom and dad.  That was truly heartbreaking.  When his dad walked in the room, I hadn't seen his parents in about 20 years, and I had truly forgotten how much J favored his dad.  It was like being kicked in the chest with a steel toed boot.   I literally lost my breath.  It was good to be with them and share stories with them of J's time living with me in Florida, and of my memories of him.  They're struggling a lot and I know it helped them too.  All in all, it was a very healing time."
