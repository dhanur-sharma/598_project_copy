        "Summarize the following story in first person: I found out that my boyfriend was cheating on me with a very close friend. We had been together for six wonderful years that I thought were all great.  My boyfriend was a hard worker who had always been constantly at work. One time he left his cellphone at home and I was looking on it to play a game because my phone died. I noticed that my boyfriend was immersed in a very long conversation with my girlfriend from childhood. I didn't really think much about it because I talk to my friends. We were all very close so this didn't catch me completely off guard. I went through only a little bit, nothing seemed out of place, and I felt bad for invading his privacy. I decided that I would never do that again because I didn't suspect it was possible for him to cheat. A few weeks later, I noticed some of her clothing was at my house after I went on a trip with some other girlfriends for the weekend. I was very concerned now, and had to get a hold of his phone again. When I finally succeeded, I found out clearly they were having an affair. I was completely crushed and went into a great depression. After much debating with myself, I decided to break up with him. Now I am trying to repair my relationship with my girlfriend. I understand that people make mistakes. I hope that they both have a great life. But this changed the way that I view life."
