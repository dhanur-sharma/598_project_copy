        "Summarize the following story in first person: About a week ago a received a phone call from a friend of mine saying that he was in jail and I had to go bail him out. He hung up the phone and I barely got the details of his arrest. I rushed over the police station where he was being held to try bailing him out. I called a few friends that would help and our lawyer to meet us up at the station. I drove there as quickly as I could to come to my friend's rescue. When I got there the lawyer had already arrived and was talking to the police. He told me that he had been arrested for possession of illegal drugs and needed 50000 cash bail. He told of how the policemen came knocking on his door one Saturday morning. He was just busy having his breakfast without a worry in the world. The police demanded they search the house. He questioned them on why or what they were looking for and they said drugs. They already had a search warrant so they just went in the house and started searching. When they found the drugs they arrested him and took him to the station. He did not know where the drugs had come from. He wondered who might have told on him."

I knew he was not a bad person and would never do such a thing. I knew he was innocent until proven guilty. I told him that we would figure out a way to get him out of this mess. The lawyer said that we could get him released on bail. We would have to pay the bail money and he would have to show up in court. I knew this was not going to be easy. I told him that I would be there for him no matter what. I was so angry and sad that this was happening to him. I was determined to help him get out of this situation."
