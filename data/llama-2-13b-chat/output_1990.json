        "Summarize the following story in first person: A very memorable recent experience for me was when I found out I was pregnant. I hadn't had my period in a good while and decided to get a pregnancy test. It came back positive and I took another just to be safe. Also positive. I then went online for how positive pregnancy tests look just to be safe. I told my husband and he smile and kissed me and held me. He proceeded to go and tell a bunch of his coworkers and family and I told a couple of friends. His mother was understandably excited. The next months were filled with lots of doctor visits, body changes, and way too much money spent on baby stuff. I gained so much weight. We got a brand new crib and stroller and shopped around for affordable but high quality baby stuff. I went to the emergency room a few times. Being pregnant for the first time, I wasn't sure what was normal and what wasn't. I have a nurse that comes to see me from time to time and shes been a great help as well. The baby is due soon and I'm super excited. This is a huge change. The baby has gotten so big and he kicks a ton. You can even see him moving."
