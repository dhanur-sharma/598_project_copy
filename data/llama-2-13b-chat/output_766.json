Brownie is my pet puppy, she is almost 6 months old now. I got her when she was 3 months old. I was feeling a bit down and depressed since my move to the new workplace. New settings, new people. It was quite lonely. I always felt a bit scared to get another dog. This fear began since my childhood dog scooby passed away. I didn't think i could tolerate such a loss again. However, it was time. She is chocolate brown color. German shepard breed. The sweetest dog on the planet if you ask me. Ever since she stepped into my apartment and life, joy is plentiful. I love her."

I have to keep her occupied with walks, toys, and treats. She is my shadow. She follows me everywhere. I have to tell her everyday how much i love her and how grateful i am to have her in my life. I know she is still a puppy, but she already means so much to me. I am so glad i adopted her. She is the best thing that has happened to me in a long time.\n\n"
