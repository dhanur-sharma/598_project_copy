        "Summarize the following story in first person: Isn't this how it always ends up? People say they are \"available and open\" but they aren't. They create this dumb and nonsense reasons why they can date you or see you anymore. You think you have found the the best thing going, you finally see yourself happy and before you know it it is all over. So I met this guy. He was just about everything I wanted in a man. He was cute cute, funny, witty and just over all pretty mellow and even keeled. We met at a party. I am a wall flower and extremely introverted but can strike up a conversation if I feel good vibes from someone. I felt them from his and initially was just trying to not look like a loner at the party, so I struck up a conversation. We ended up talking for a few hours and exchanged numbers. We parted ways that night and I left feeling all warm and fuzzy and wanting to reconnect. Looking forward to hopefully hearing and seeing from him again. Now, this time I was determined to do it right. Get to know him. Let him get to know me and not just jump right into sex and watch him disappear. I DID THAT! We took it slow, went on a few dates. Spent time getting to know one another and it was great! And when we started having sex and all that it was even better! But then the dreaded, it's not you its me crap. And I need time and space because I am dealing with some family stuff. BLAH BLAH BLAH. I bet he was married. I don't even feel like trying anymore."
