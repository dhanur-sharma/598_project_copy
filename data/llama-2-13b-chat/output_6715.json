        "Summarize the following story in first person: This past March, we held a memorial service for my mother. She passed away 5 years ago. She had Myelofibrosis which is a type of bone marrow cancer. The last year of her life was very painful for her and her passing was a blessing. Some of my family members and her close friends gathered together at the local Elks lodge where she and her husband had been members for many years. A few of us there got up and spoke about my Mom. About what a wonderful and caring person that she was. The most surprising thing was a few of mom's friends who showed up who hadn't seen her in many years. It was very touching. It was extremely emotional and alot of tears were shed. It really affirmed just how much people loved and cared about her. But it was good to bond with everyone and exchange some stories about many of the good times that we had spent with her over the years. I was very close to my Mom and miss her quite alot. But I am very thankful for the relationship we had. She was someone I could always talk to about almost anything. Her love and support were unconditional. I am the type of person I am because of my mother.  She taught me how important it is to tell the people that you are close to how much they mean to you. And as I get older, I realize that more and more. I am so glad that she knew how much I loved her."
