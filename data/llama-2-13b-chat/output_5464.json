Around June she started feeling exhausted to a problematic degree. It was under my insistence she agreed to get checked up. She has always been scared of hospitals. I was feeling scared myself. But i did not express it openly. How could i? The doctors told me right away that something was wrong. 2 days of extensive tests. Breast cancer. Thankfully, it is just in the starting stage. It was a huge blow to me though. Surprisingly, mom was calm when she got the news. Perhaps she knew it somehow deep in her."

It has been a tough road, but mom has been handling it like a champ. The most touching thing was when she told me she was not scared, and that she was ready to fight. She would say, 'i am not going anywhere, my baby'. She would hold my hand through every treatment and never let go. I would get so scared and teary eyed, but she would always be there for me. I remember one day when i was feeling particularly low, she came to me and said, 'its okay, my baby. Im here. We will get through this together'. I just broke down and hugged her. That moment will always be etched in my memory. It was a moment of pure love and strength. I am so grateful to have a mom like her."
