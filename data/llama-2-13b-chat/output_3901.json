        "Summarize the following story in first person: A few months ago I attended my sisters wedding. She has always wanted to get married and finally she had met the perfect man and was very ecstatic and happy. I was very happy for her and proud that she wanted me as her maid of honor.  The wedding was beautiful, she had saved up for quite some time and spared no expense in getting exactly what she wanted.  The venue was beautiful and it definitely reminded me of a fairy tale wedding to say the very least. While we were at the reception having a great time, I was finally able to congratulate her and give her a big hug.  Unfortunately, not used to wearing heels, I tripped just as we were leaning in for a hug and I spilled my red wine all over her beautiful and no doubt very expensive dress.  I was mortified!  Fortunately, she laughed it off and told me that it only made her dress have more character and something to remember the event by.  I have always been somewhat of a klutz so this isn't out of the ordinary for me in the very least.  I can only hope the stain comes out as I would hate to think I've ruined such a beautiful gown! All in all I am quite embarrassed but very happy for my sister.  This was one event that I was proud to attend, even if it was ruined by a little red wine.  I am happy she could find such a caring husband as she deserves it. I was also glad to have had the ability to attend and send her off."
