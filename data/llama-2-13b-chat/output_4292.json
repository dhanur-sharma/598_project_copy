        "Summarize the following story in first person: Me,my sister, and my three brothers took my Dad to Ireland, which was something he had always regretted not doing, and never thought he would get to before he died. He was 88, and we knew that this would make him so happy. The kindness and sheer simplicity of our visit is something that we all will never forget. The people of Ireland are friendly, welcome long lost kin as if we had been best friends forever, and take part in a simpler way of life that just held so much meaning for my Dad. Evenings were filled with music, as friends and family gather in someone's home for a nice night of Irish ballads, whiskey, good food, and lots of laughs. My dad loved the old fashioned meals, with fresh butter, eggs and vegetables right from the farm we were staying at.  He could not get over all the sheep that his relatives owned. My Dad, even at 88, ( now 89), makes a point to walk about five miles a day, and found the little lanes and paths in the villages we stayed in to be special, like travellng back in time. The highlight of the trip was an AA meeting. My Dad came back from Korea and promptly developed a drinking problem, and very luckily, sought help from Alcohol Anonymous in 1954. The has faithfully gone to weekly meetings since then , and this year, celebrated 65 years sobriety. He went to a meeting not too far from where his grandfather grew up, met some wonderful people, and said it was a memory he will carry with him through eternity. Another great by product of this trip is how it keeps my siblings and I close. We each take turns choosing events or trips to take together to keep us close. We lost our mom when we were very young, and we know just how important family can be, because you can lose a part of it in an instant. That's why the Ireland trip was so important. For dad to meet cousins, and other relatives really made him feel part of his history. My brothers are into motorcycles, and while eating at a nearby pub, met some other like minded distant relatives, and went on a nice long ride all along that section of Ireland, on rented bikes. My brothers are all Harley boys, but enjoyed the Irish motorcycles a lot. One place Dad wanted to see , was St Patrick's Cathedral inDublin, so we took him there. We have a picture my brother Tim took, of Dad walked down the long aisle toward the altar. My dad is only five feet tall, and the majesty of the cathedral with my dad in the middle of it makes quite a statement. The memories of this trip will always be with us, long after my dad passes, and worth every penny and every minute."
