        "Summarize the following story in first person: Since this event has happened, I have since reconciled with my boyfriend. I was incredibly angry and upset with him at first, I wanted absolutely nothing to do with him. But, as time passed, he continued to try to contact me. Eventually, I gave in, and we are now back together. I do not regret my decision, and I do believe that our relationship is stronger than it was before. I do sometimes get feelings of suspicion or feelings that he is going to cheat on me once again, but I try to see past those feelings because I know that he really loves me. I never told my parents about the situation because I know that they would never want me to see him again. They would have told me that I need to know my self worth and that I should be with someone who would never do that to me. I agree, but I think he made a mistake that hopeful he will learn from and we will overcome as a couple. It has not been easy, but I still love him and care about him, and I am trying to make this work the best that I can. If this does happen again, however, I will never see him again. I have made a promise to myself that I will do my best to look out for myself and I will leave him if he ever cheats again. I do not want to be one of those girls who gets repeatedly cheated on and stays anyway. I will not let that be me. But i am truly hoping that he will change as a person."
