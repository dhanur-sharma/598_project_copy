        "Summarize the following story in first person: My first day at a new school. My father dropped me off to school i was six years old and i was admitted to the one grade. I was just transferred from my previous school. This was because my father had just received a transfer letter from the company he was working with and we had to relocate to a new state. i remember  crying about how i would miss my friends and play mates i knew starting over in a new place would be hard for me  but there wasn't much i could do.  My New school was awesome especially the way they treated new in takes. the name of my class teacher was Ms Fatema she was very friendly and she introduce to my mates. i was already excited over the new school. The was well equipped with facilities than my former school. The environment was very neat and spacious. Deep in my mind i knew i would love the school. I love the way teachers care about the students. I can remember asking my dad the  if he liked the school. he told me it look like it would be a great school for me. the school was located in the state of New York."
