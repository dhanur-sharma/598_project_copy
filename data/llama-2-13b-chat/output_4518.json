        "Summarize the following story in first person: On June 15th, 2019, me and my family went to Idlewild Park and Soak Zone, a local amusement park. This park was rated as the #1 Children's amusement park in the world, of which I was very skeptical, as this was my first time going there. My wife and I got the kids up at about 7 AM for breakfast and to get ready to leave. Around 9:30 AM, my in-laws arrived to join us, and we all piled into the van for the hour-long drive to the park. We hit the road, and arrived at the park around 10:30 AM, which was good, because we wanted to get there when the gates opened at 10:30 AM. We found a parking spot and everyone got out to apply sunscreen, and gather their accessories for swimming in Soak Zone and the lunch we had packed for the day. We headed into the park, and were immediately amazed by the number of rides for children tat were available. The park layout was sprawling and went off into the woods in seemingly all directions. The kids were overwhelmed with excitement, and started feverishly discussing and pointing to where we would head first. We spent a few hours riding various rides: the train, a rope climb, ball pit, and walked through Storybook Forest. All the attractions were amazing! It was now lunch time, so we stopped at a pavilion to eat lunch and get a break from the hot, summer sun.  Then we headed to Soak Zone to cool off. We spent the rest of the day riding watersides, in the wave pool, the lazy river, and enjoying each other's company. Before we knew it, it was 6 PM and Soak Zone was closing, so we left to grab a bite to eat, and headed home. It was an amazing experience, and I can see why Idlewild and Soak Zone is rated the #1 Children's amusement park in the world."
