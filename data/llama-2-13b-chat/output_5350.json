        "Summarize the following story in first person: My son asked his girlfriend to marry him on Aug. 11th 2019. He proposed on the beach on our family vacation. It was such a happy time for our family.  It got me to thinking. I have been married to my wonderful wife for thirty five years and now my son gets to start that journey.  I also said wouldnt it be neat if I proposed to marry my wife all over again and re-new our vowels. We went to visit my dad in the hometown where we both grew up. We got married at the church I grew up in.  It was a united methodist church.   So I said lets go for a ride and see what has changed in our town.   In the process of riding around we passed the church and I said lets go in for a bit see if anything has changed. We get inside and no one was around  , so  we go down to the alter in the front of the church  and I look her in the eyes and get down on one knee.  She starts teering up and ask what are you doing?   I said My wifes name and asked if she would marry me again?  It was such an emotional time for us both because we had stood in that very spot some thirty five years ago and got married.   My wife was overwelmed with emotion   but she did say yes!    Such a sweet time for us."
