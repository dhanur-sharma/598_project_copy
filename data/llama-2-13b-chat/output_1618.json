        "Summarize the following story in first person: Two weeks ago, I went to a water park with my girlfriend and her nephew to celebrate his birthday. He was excited because he had just graduated swimming school and remembers that last year he couldn't get on as many rides because he didn't know how to swim very well. My brother and sister-in-law joined us to take part in the birthday festivities. This was to be a pre-celebration of sorts since the official birthday party was the following day. While my sister-in-law and girlfriend were watching her nephew, my brother and I regressed to our childhood and decided to get on as many rides as possible. We started with one called Turbo Drop \u2014 a slide that drops from a height of 6-stories that I remember being terrified of as a kid. Now that I'm older, I am still freaked out by it but decided to follow my fear and do it anyway. What a thrill! We did some surfing on the artificial waves and got on a few more rides after waiting in line for what seemed like hours. Met with the group for lunch and had some of the park's famous Impossible Burgers. I have to say that I wasn't disappointed. After the birthday festivities, we decided to go to a Salsa Nightclub and dance the night away. The more I drank, the more creative my dance moves got. I had an incredible time but remember how miserable I felt the morning after from all the drinking I did. Thankfully, my girlfriend doesn't drink much and had pancakes with eggs waiting for me for breakfast. I am one lucky guy."
