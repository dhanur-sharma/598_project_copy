        "Summarize the following story in first person: My friend has been gone in the military on a tour of duty in Iraq for about a year now. We grew up together and went ot the same schools all the way through high school. We are very close. I missed her quite a bit. Her boyfriend also went to school with us and we know each other very well also. We were super happy when she told us that she was coming home. We had a big party for her and everything. It was great that she came back just a few weeks before the 4th of July holiday. We decided to do something low-key for it and just hang out at her house with her boyfriend and just bbq and enjoy it. From where she lives you can clearly see the towns fireworks show, so it all worked out simply perfectly. The show was long and has amazing fireworks. I cooked up most of the food since I love to bbq and cook whenever possible. I didn't mind. I am just glad tat my friend was finally home and safe. It was a memorable holiday and I hope we do it again next year because of is being such a great and amazing time. I really look forward to it!"
