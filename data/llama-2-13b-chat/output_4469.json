I love all people and love to talk with everyone. Race doesn't matter to me at all. I will talk and treat anyone the same no matter the color of their skin. I went to visit my family back in New York and my dad showed his true colors. We were walking down the main road and he was shouting vulgar and obscene words. I have never been so embarrased in my whole life. What type of person does these type of things? How could this be the person that raised me? How did I turn out so different then he.  Would my life be different if I was raised by someone else? Why didn't my mom protect me from my dad more? let me tell you, he almost got in numerous fights saying racist comments to everyone around him. I wanted to crawl into a hole and hide from this man. Maybe he just doesn't understand,"
