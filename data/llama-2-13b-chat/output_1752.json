        "Summarize the following story in first person: My boyfriend, Joe, just turned 30 a month ago.  I wanted to make his \"Big 30\" special so I threw him a surprise birthday party.  I started thinking about this about 4 months before his birthday.  It's a good thing, too, because there was a lot of planning to do for it.  I enlisted the help of a few friends of ours to help make this night extra special for all of us, but especially for Joe.  He is such a sweet, caring guy who everyone loves so it wasn't very hard to get others to help me.We met one evening when Joe was working.  I kind of knew where I wanted to have the party already, if everyone else thought it was a good idea.  We all like to go to a local sports bar called Ike's.  They have sports on most of the time but they also have some local favorite bands we all enjoy.  Joe's birthday was on a Wednesday so we thought we should have it the Saturday before so he would really be surprised.  A friend of Joe's volunteered to keep him busy that Saturday.  That worked out great, giving the rest of us plenty of time to get everything set up in the back room at Ike's.  We decorated a little with some sports stuff and some black balloons.  Everyone showed up around 6 and milled around til we got the news they were on the way.  As they entered the bar, the bartender greeted them loudly enough so we knew it was time.  As they entered the room, Joe's parents were the first people he saw.  Behind him were about 20 others, all yelling \"Happy Birthday Joe!\", as loud as they could.  Everyone seemed to have such a good time and Joe was totally surprised.  At one point, the singer who was working that evening came in and sang Happy Birthday to Joe and we all joined in.  After the party, Joe's Mom came to me and told me she wanted to pay for everything.  She was thrilled about the party and happy to pay for it which was not expected but was very nice.  Joe and I were very pleased with all the people who came.  But Joe is a great guy and most everyone loves him.  He's a keeper."
