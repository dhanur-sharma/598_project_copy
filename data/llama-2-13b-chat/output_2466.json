        "Summarize the following story in first person: About 2 weeks ago we had a 4th of July party at my cousin's house.  Everyone started showing up around 2 in the afternoon for a cookout.  Almost everyone in the family was there plus some of my cousins friends. it was great to see family that I haven't seen in awhile and little nieces and nephews. My cousin just cooked the usual hamburgers and hot dogs and as it got close to dinner time they put steaks and chicken on the grill.  My aunt had made macaroni and cheese and salad.  I brought apple pies and chocolate cake. Everyone stayed in the backyard and the kids played in the pool. There ended up being  at least 10 little kids at the party. The adults served the food, cleaned up and caught up on the latest family news. Everyone brought fireworks they had bought to make one big pile.  My brother made a safe area in the backyard to shoot fireworks off at dark.  We actually got started a little early since the kids couldn't wait any longer. My cousins were in charge of lighting most all of the fireworks while we set back and watched the show. I was quite surprised at how many fireworks we had. It seemed like they were shooting off fireworks for hours and it was well after 10 p.m. before some started leaving. The kids were so tired and most of them had fallen asleep.  We stayed and helped clean up the backyard.  I thanked my cousin for such a great family event. I can't wait till we do it again next year and possibly at my house."
