        "Summarize the following story in first person: So tonight I met up with Rob again. I know, we have been seeing each other a lot lately! I thought it was time for me to tell him about my past. Yup, I finally told him what happened with my last boyfriend, Bill. I was so scared, but it worked out great! Hold on, let me start from the beginning. Rob asked me to go out with him tonight to Olive Garden. I know it's not super fancy, but it is one of my favorite restaurants. So we arrived and decided to share our food and have more variety. So we ordered a large Seafood Alfredo,, the trio of appetizers, and desert. With unlimited soup, salad and breadsticks of course. We were just starting on our desert when I worked up the nerve. I told Rob about what Bill did. I let him know why I had such trouble opening up and why I was always just a little bit scared even when things seemed perfect. I thought he would see me differently. Instead he decided to open up to me. His last girlfriend had passed away in a car wreck about 3 years ago and that's why he could be a bit clingy at times. OMG I had no clue! Poor Rob! We sat and talked for about an hour after that. The poor waiter! We did leave a nice tip though to make up for it. I just feel so free now and I am glad that me opening up only deepened out relationship."
