        "Summarize the following story in first person: I went for a run this morning, and I couldn't finish.  My knee was really hurting.  There was no ignoring it this time.  I had noticed the knee pain from time to time the last few months.  I initially chalked it up to the increase in my distance running since I was prepping for a half marathon.   I was starting to worry that I had a small tear in a tendon or possibly had done some serious damage to my kneecap the last time I fell while running in the rain.  I decided that I needed to call a doctor and have it checked out.  My regular doctor was able to get me in the next day, first thing in the morning.  He instructed me not to take painkillers or do anything that might effect the actual issue I was dealing with.  Normally, the pain went away relatively quickly, but not this time.  I was DYING to use some ICY HOT, or take some Advil.  As promised, the doc saw me at 9am bright and early - I had never been so happy to see him.  He ran some tests, took some blood, wrenched my knee this way and that until it brought tears to my eyes.  He also ran an extra AND took an Ultrasound.  All this uncertainty had me extremely worried.   He said he thought I had arthritis, but really wanted me to see an orthopedic doctor to confirm.  At 33, he felt I was really awful young and healthy to be worried about arthritis.   I was shuttled to the other side of the hospital offices to meet with the ortho doc.   He did, in fact, confirm that I had Osteoarthritis in my knee.   There really is no CURE or treatment, only a way to calm the symptoms.  I felt really defeated.  I loved to run - it was my source of stress relief and made me feel so good about myself.   The doctor suggested I cut back to my old running routine, and put the half marathon on hold - apparently by giving my knee a break and boosting bone strengthening vitamin intake - my knee might bounce back later.   But in my mind,...all I could imagine was being 45 and walking with a cane.  I mean, if it is already starting at my age - I didn't like to think about what the future would hold."
