In the morning of June 6th, 2019, my sister and I had an argument. I left the house without telling her and ate some of her food, which made her angry when she found out. When I came home from work, she confronted me about it and we got into a heated argument, but thankfully my other sister intervened before things got out of hand.",2,63

I cried for days, and I couldn't get home fast enough. I went to the airport, and waited for my return flight. When I got home, I blocked her number, and I never talked to her again.  
I remember this experience like it was yesterday, and it will forever be in my mind. I learned that when it comes to love, and relationships, you can never be too careful. I will never forget the pain I felt that day, and I will never forget the lesson I learned.",2,86

I was deeply moved when a person I know successfully completed a year in high school band and orchestra, despite being diagnosed with bipolar disorder and struggling with delusions and medication side effects. He had been taking music lessons since he was four years old and practiced diligently, but his mind gave him difficulty concentrating and he had periods of wellness and struggle. I didn't know if he would be able to make it, but he was determined and kept fighting, practicing, and attending doctor's visits. He had some setbacks, but he kept going and played in the concerts at the end of the year, proudly declaring, ""I made it!"" His perseverance and determination touched",2,112

She was a little nervous too, but we both knew it was meant to be. We hugged and talked a lot about how we were feeling, and it was amazing.
 
In February 2019, I traveled overseas to meet the woman I had been chatting with online for years.

After a long and stressful journey, I finally got to see her and her brother at the airport, and it was like a dream come true.",2,97

I am grateful for my little boy's life.  I am grateful for the lesson that this incident has taught me, and that is to never take a moment for granted.

  I haven't spoken to my mother in over 30 years, since she left when I was 4 and I was raised by an abusive stepmother.

"case, it is possible to say that it is not always the case. The market price is not always the equilibrium price. If the price is below the equilibrium level, then the offer exceeds demand. The volume of supply exceeds the volume of demand, and this leads to a surplus. If the price is above the equilibrium level, then the offer is less than demand, and this leads to a shortage. This is because the supply and demand curves are not always parallel to each other. In the first case, the price will increase and in the second case, it will decrease. The situation when the demand and supply curves intersect is called a state of equilibrium, because it is the point where the two forces are equal. At this point, the market is in a state of balance, because the price is equal to the price of the offer and the quantity of the goods is equal to the quantity of demand. At this point, the market is in a state of balance, because the price is equal to the price of the offer and the quantity of the goods is equal to the quantity of demand.
