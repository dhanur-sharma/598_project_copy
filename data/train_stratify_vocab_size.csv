"case, it is possible to say that it is not always the case. The market price is not always the equilibrium price. If the price is below the equilibrium level, then the offer exceeds demand. The volume of supply exceeds the volume of demand, and this leads to a surplus. If the price is above the equilibrium level, then the offer is less than demand, and this leads to a shortage. This is because the supply and demand curves are not always parallel to each other. In the first case, the price will increase and in the second case, it will decrease. The situation when the demand and supply curves intersect is called a state of equilibrium, because it is the point where the two forces are equal. At this point, the market is in a state of balance, because the price is equal to the price of the offer and the quantity of the goods is equal to the quantity of demand. At this point, the market is in a state of balance, because the price is equal to the price of the offer and the quantity of the goods is equal to the quantity of demand.

"The assisted living community will have a nurse who will administer medications. The nurse will also give out medication reminders. If the resident doesn't need a nurse, they can choose to have the meds pre-filled and delivered by a third-party pharmacy. This can be expensive. If a resident is in need of a nurse, the community may not be able to accommodate them. There are usually two types of assisted living contracts. The first is a ""Type A"" contract. This is a traditional assisted living contract. This means that the facility provides the resident with all the care that they need. The second is a ""Type B"" contract. This is a fee-for-service contract. This means that the resident pays for only the services they need. Someone who is not self-sufficient will need a ""Type A"" contract. If a resident has a fall, the staff will respond and take them to the hospital. If the resident is in need of rehabilitation, the community will help arrange for that.

  My first thought upon finishing my graduation ceremony was ""wow, that was anticlimactic."" I was expecting something more... grand. After all, this was the culmination of 5 years of hard work, blood, sweat, and tears. I was expecting something like the movies, where the graduate walks across the stage to ""Pomp and Circumstance"" and the crowd erupts in cheers and applause. Instead, it was just a quick walk across the stage, a handshake with the dean, and a ""congratulations"" from the president of the university. No fanfare, no pomp and circumstance. Just a quick ""thank you"" and a handshake. I guess that's just how it is for a small community college. No big deal, right? Wrong. As I walked across the stage, I heard a loud, booming voice coming from the back of the arena. ""Congratulations! You did it!"" it shouted. I turned to see who it was, and my jaw dropped.

My 18th birthday came and went without much celebration, but my mom did take me out for pizza and gave me a gift card to Ulta. She's been struggling to make ends meet and has had to pick up extra shifts at work to pay for things. My dad called me last week and wanted to meet up, but he didn't want me to tell my mom. I was nervous, but he looked different than I remembered and tried to give me a hug when he picked me up. We went for ice cream and he opened up to me about why he left my mom. He said they were arguing all the time and had fallen out of love. I felt bad for him and told him I loved him. We're going to work out a way to see each other and he'll talk to my mom. I'm feeling much better about my life now and am looking forward to seeing my dad again next week.",2,109

I could write about a few different things, but I am going to write about our recent family vacation.  This took place back in May.  My family and I typically vacation with my sister and her family.

We would drive to Destin and Panama City and tour the city, walk on the pier, eat and shop.  The last time we were in Florida, my youngest was 8 months old",2,126

If you feel like you’re going to break, tell someone you trust, such as a friend or family member, that you’re “feeling overwhelmed, overstimulated, or on the verge of a breakdown.” They may be able to help in ways you haven’t thought of. If you’re in a bind and don’t have someone to turn to, phone a hotline or online support group. “You’ll be surprised by the amount of help available to you,” Duffy said. “And, if you’re not sure what you need, start by talking to someone who’s been through something similar. They may have valuable insights.”Remember that you’re not alone. “You have a community of people who have been through hell and back,” said Howes. “And they can offer you support, guidance, and understanding.”

Dear Diary, I'm still upset about what happened with Jerry. It's been bothering me so much that I haven't even been able to write about it here. But now I think it's time... About 3 months ago, my husband's brother, Jerry, came to stay with us at our house. He told us he wanted to get off drugs, and that rehab didn't work and wasn't for him.

I was able to take the time to view a lot of beautiful pieces of art. One of my favorites was the work of Sisson Blanchard, a Haitian artist. His oil canvas painting Fowl and Melons was very beautiful and unique. The painting was able to grab my attention because of the colors and the birds in it. 
Looking at the painting, I noticed the colors red, orange, yellow, deep blue and purple were used and it gave off a warmth feeling of harmony. I believe the artist wanted to balance the painting by carefully choosing which colors to incorporate into it. The artist also used lines to create the shapes of the birds and the melons. The texture of the painting is oily, but the details such as the feather bumps and circles make it seem rough and bumpy. There is also shrubbery in the spaces where there are no birds, which makes you feel like you would get poked if you touched it. Lastly, the value of light in the painting was strong due to the colors used.",2,109
