Essentially, the lactic acid kills off the adult parasites, while the annatto kills off the eggs and larvae. The combination of the two is what works so well.

I was overjoyed at the results and decided to research further into the matter. After some time, I discovered that the cheese was made from a specific type of cow that is immune to parasites, which explains the lack of parasites in the cheese.

It is not as important as it is that she is not looking at Cupid. This indicates that she is a mortal and not immortal like Cupid. The second detail is the way that Cupid is looking at Psyche. His eyes are not focused on her physical form, but more so on her face. He is not looking at her as a sexual object, but as a person. He is also looking at her as if he is deeply in love with her. The third detail is the way that Cupid is holding his arrows. The arrows are not being used to attack, but are rather being used to protect. This indicates that Cupid is not looking to harm Psyche but is instead looking to protect her. The fourth detail is the way that Psyche is folding her arms over her body.

Wedding Photographer’s Rage
I am a wedding photographer, and I have always taken my job very seriously. But one day, as I stood at the front of the church, waiting for the ceremony to begin, I saw something that made me snap. A selfie stick, extended midway into the aisle, belonging to a disrespectful guest. I couldn't take it anymore, and my legs seemed to move on their own as I walked down the aisle and yanked the selfie stick from its owner's hands. I held it high above my head and broke it in two, handing the pieces back to the startled owner. I knew that my actions would end my career as a wedding photographer, but I didn't care. I had stood up for what I believed in, and for that, I would always be proud.",2,1.0263284739916079
