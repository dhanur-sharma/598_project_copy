"successfully handle difficult situations and overcome obstacles. Self-esteem is the feeling of being worthwhile as a person. We gain self-esteem by being appreciated and valued by others, and by doing things that we value ourselves. The more we believe in our own abilities, the more we will be able to achieve. As a high school student, I see so many different students living so many different lives. I see so much sadness from people with so much potential, and so much goodness. Overtime, I realized that a lot of this comes from a lack of self-love and self-confidence. I began watching endless ted talks about confidence, openness, and outreach. From this I have created a montra for myself that defines how I live. “Be so confident and so grounded in yourself, that you are able to love others regardless of division, jealously, or judgement.” I try to live by these words every day. To be proud of who I am, and what I have to offer the world. And by becoming confident in my life, I am able to inspire confidence in others. I am able to show others their potential and goodness regardless of how different",2,0.29859090909090913

Niagara Falls Vacation
As I reflect on our family vacation to Niagara Falls, Canada a few summers ago, I can still remember the excitement and anticipation leading up to our departure. We had planned this week-long trip for months, and it was arranged so that we could visit relatives who lived in the area.
On the morning we were to leave, I woke up early due to the sunlight shining through my window. I used this extra time to finish packing my belongings that I had forgotten to pack the night before. We left around 9:30 on a warm, July Monday morning. The trip was long, and when we finally arrived, we were exhausted. So, we decided to rest and start out early the following morning.
One of the highlights of our trip was visiting Ride Niagara, a simulated ride over the Niagara Falls. It was rather realistic, and we felt as if we were actually soaring over the falls without moving from a set position. After the ride, we met a French Canadian who lived in Quebec and had a heavy accent. He helped us decide which attractions were worthwhile, and",2,0.030729166666666665

"The pediatrician said she needed to see a cardiologist, which was a big concern for her employer. She was so scared, she didn't know what to do. The cardiologist's visit was the next day. The pediatrician gave her a referral to a cardiologist and Belle was to be seen the next day. The cardiologist said that it was just anxiety and panic attacks. He gave her a prescription for Xanax and said she needed to take it before bedtime and/or before a panic attack. He also told her to go to therapy and work on her anxiety and panic attacks. The cardiologist also told her that she was perfectly fine and did not have any heart issues, which was a huge relief to all of us. He also told her to take it easy and not to overexert herself, which was also a huge relief. She was so scared, she didn't know what to do.

"The wings are folded behind him. This painting is a perfect example of how artists of the Neoclassical period looked to the mythological past for inspiration, and how they were able to revive the classical ideals of art in their own works. As the 19th century progressed, artists continued to look to mythology as inspiration for their artwork. The Pre-Raphaelite movement, for example, was heavily influenced by mythological stories and the works of Shakespeare. The Pre-Raphaelite artists sought to create art that was beautiful, detailed, and emotionally powerful, and they often turned to mythology for inspiration. One of the most famous Pre-Raphaelite artists was Dante Gabriel Rossetti, who painted a number of works inspired by mythology, including ""The Blessed Damozel"" and ""Proserpine"". These paintings featured beautiful, dreamlike landscapes and figures, and were characterized by their attention to detail and their use of vibrant, symbolic colors. In addition to Rossetti, other notable Pre-Raphaelite artists included John Everett Millais, William Holman Hunt, and Edward",2,0.32447916666666665

"I was shocked and appalled by his behavior. I had never seen my father act in such a way. I was hurt and angry, but I knew I couldn't show it. I just stood there and watched it all happen. After the funeral, I was approached by several people who told me that they were shocked by my father's behavior. They couldn't believe that he would do something like that. I didn't know what to say, but I knew that I couldn't defend his actions. It has been two weeks since the funeral and I am still trying to process everything that happened. It has been a difficult time for me, but I am trying to stay strong.

I had a great time talking with the other parents, and my daughter had a blast playing with her friends. As we were leaving, Sheila came up to me and thanked me for bringing my daughter. She said she hoped that my daughter would be able to come back next year and bring some of her friends. I smiled and told her that my daughter would definitely be back. I was amazed at the creativity and thoughtfulness that Sheila put into the party, and I am so glad that my daughter was able to be a part of it.
